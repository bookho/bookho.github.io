			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room where Lucien is located is located on the third floor of the castle. It is more than ten meters away from the ground. Even the official knight, jumping directly from such a high place It will fall, and in order not to become a target of "dry shadow" and high-level magic in the air, the "feathering" that slowly falls is not the best choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien started doing nothing at first, relying on gravity to pull, falling at the speed of free fall, and then exciting after a short calculation time. The flight technique, with the help of the gravitational pull of the stars, slowed down the speed of the landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was not far from the ground, Lucien quickly stepped on the courtyard soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process is like jumping a parachute. The only problem is the exact surname of the calculation. Otherwise, it will take too much time in the air, it is a little dangerous, or the speed of slowing down is not enough. It is easy to fall on your own, or because the speed changes too much in a very short period of time, causing physical damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple question for the soul, memory and computing power that far exceeds that of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard soil became solid due to barrenness, and Lucian’s feet slid quickly, avoiding the broken colors of the different colors falling in the sky, going directly to the castle. The gate rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Leo has a magic ring that can stimulate the feathers, Lucien didn’t worry about whether he could jump down at first, just afraid of him. In the air, it was affected by magic or withered forces - but Leo was not as important as Lucian and Count of Witt as Lucian, and there was no need to fear that they deliberately directed the power of venting to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien just ran a few steps, and the mental field sensed that Leo was flying by Ivanovsky, like a broken doll. It fell to the garden soil in the distance and made a loud sound of "touching". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Nikonov did not directly fall under the attack of Earl Witt, his magical array of temporary movements placed before Lucian’s hands was already faltering. But they haven't reached the limit yet, so the big knights and knights in the castle are still undetectable - the battle between Count Wit and Nikonov is so fierce that they can't handle the magic array, whether it is reinforcement The blockade, or destruction, to transmit intelligence to the outside world, they have not tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivanovsky is a great knight?!" Lucian, who judged the strength of Ivanovsky from this boxing, was quite surprised. I didn’t even see it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although trained knights can conceal their strength by controlling pace, muscle contraction, heartbeat, blood, etc., but they are often willing to Inadvertently, it will reveal the momentum of the monks, people will be aware of their inner horror, and in their two face-to-face conversations with Ivanovsky, he is so natural, like a real A quasi-knight who relies on pharmacy to stimulate blood power, a boss who has controlled the smuggling organization for many years, but has no strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I was in Carlylena's manor, I would directly attack him in the presence of two intermediate-level professional protections around Ivanovsky. I am afraid that I am probably dead because of me..." Lucien was slightly glad that he did not act recklessly, so that the advantage of information asymmetry could be brought into play. Then Lucien felt that Leo had a painful sorrow and stood up, and Ivan Nevsky jumped out of the window and rushed toward himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo was stunned by Ivanovsky after a punch, and awakened by the violent shock of landing, feeling the head and body like to fall apart Painful, my heart secretly said: "After being seriously injured, a high-ranking knight attendant can kill me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Ivanovsky It is a fist, but the power of the 3rd and 4th-level knights is so terrible. If Leo was not in the state of the frost giant's blood, it would make his head break like a watermelon falling from the sky. This is the case, Leo's half face is also completely smashed, the bones are broken, the blood flows down the mouth, the golden stars are flying all over the sky, and the visceral bones are damaged without falling from a height of more than ten meters. Serious, there is basically no ability to fight in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the big knight and a quasi-knight is so big! Even if Leo has exchanged a lot of pharmacy in recent years, it will increase the bloodline ability to only one line difference with the official knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucian's voice rang in his ear: "I took Ivanovsky, you waited for the opportunity to escape, and then met in the place agreed before..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Ring Magic "Telecommunications". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo violently awake from the dark nightmare desperation, knowing that this time is not a time of sentimentality, and that my heart has a little motivation to live, that is Repay the lord's life-saving grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien sent a message to Leo, he kept his footsteps and dragged the residual image to the gate of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the weavers’ bracelets were fired, and a fireball hit the gate straight, making a fierce explosion, setting off the flames of the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the castle’s patron saint has not yet been inspired, the door made of steel was blown open by a fireball, allowing Lucien to go out and go The west of the Ural city flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky’s feet steadily landed, not only without injury, but also caused the earth to feel trembling, then he did not hesitate, chasing after Lucian ran out of the castle gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo is an enemy who has no official knight strength. In the case of tight time, Ivanovsky is not blind. Anyway, he killed Leo's family, not Leo killed his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indifferent attitude makes Leo a strong sorrow, no strength, even the enemy does not put you in the heart, because you simply can not take revenge There is no future for development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Leo saw Lutheran’s fireball technique blasted the castle gate, he also gave Nikonov’s temporary cover-up magic. The final blow made it completely broken, and the great knights, knights and pastors guarded in the castle heard the fierce and terrifying battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't delay any more." Leo took out a "storm" pharmacy, stabilized the injury, absorbed the body's potential, and then giantized, stepping away Strode to the castle gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After halfway, Leo was suddenly stunned by an object. He looked down and found that Matvey was left behind by the poisonous fog. One pair of legs, the black boots above are dull but only slightly damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only a magic robe, and there is a pair of magic boots..." Leo thought as he thought, taking out a piece of clothing and bending over to wrap the magic boots off. Next, then rushing out of the castle gate - if the guards of the big knights, knights return from the high-level battle in midair, they can not escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caliline in the room has been looking at the sky with high energy, watching Ivanovsky chasing Lucien to leave the castle. Watching the knights, the great knights were alarmed, watching Leo pick up the magic boots and leave, then the expression suddenly changed, cursing a sentence: "Damn Ivanovsky, actually does not remind me!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she also jumped directly from the window. When it was halfway, the body began to change rapidly, and a pair of black wings grew behind it, like the rumored devil. An evil black wing, while the forehead highlights two pointed small horns, exquisite and lovely, white skin on the skin appears to have a light black scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is the official knight, and it is the succulent blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the black wing fanning, Carlylena’s slender legs fell to the ground, just as she was going to gliding forward, a thin blood The line appeared on her forehead, and then the body quickly withered, as if a dry corpse was horrified and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most hated thing in the heart of the Earl of Witt is her, the niece who loves her and even helps her inherit the heritage of Baron Rothnikov’s heritage, Collusion with outsiders to blame themselves for their aging and serious illnesses. If they were not projected by a big man when they were near death, they knew that there were some things that would have no way to go to the end of their lives. They could not take advantage of this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he thinks that Carlylena is 10,000 times worse than Nikonov and Ivanovsky who killed Xie Miao, even if it will be good or not. The easy-to-occupy advantage gives up and kills her! Anyway, the Cavaliers and the Grand Knights have already reacted and began to inform the church by various means to inform other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
