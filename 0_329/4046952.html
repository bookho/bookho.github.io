			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking through the forest again, the three people became more and more silent. Fernando seemed to be a humanoid storm that was about to erupt. The more suppressed, the more terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret base provided to Douglas is a hidden cave, with traces of the magical array running only in the deepest, and the appearance is a natural cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Douglas, you have to live here for a few days, wait for us to arrange things, come back to you." Even though Douglas’s attitude is awkward along the way, it makes people feel like a spring breeze. When he said goodbye, Roland chose a very polite name. After all, this is a sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas was not left out of the cold, knocked on the situation inside the cave, slightly decapitated, smiled unchanged: "There is a place for me to study, I am very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't mind being wary, on the contrary, quite satisfied, because the organization that is not wary and tested by the magician who goes to the game is almost already The extinction has become the dust in history. He does not want the organization he will join in. This is no different from sending death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Antwerp’s fall, he was able to observe and think, and he understood the cruelty of the situation, under the temptation, oppression, and coercion of the church, parents Abandoning children, apprentices assassinating Master, friends attacking each other and other events emerged endlessly, and this did not disappear with the initial collapse of the magic empire, on the contrary more violent, because for a large part of the magician, there is no need to wait and hesitate, Either betray or die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best not to experiment with magic, the black-clawed dog's sense of smell is very sharp." Fernando reminded his face, fearing that this is from Antiller* * The teacher is too confident in his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took a thick piece of white paper from the storage bag. Put it on the stone bench in the cave, as if watching the most perfect lover look at them: "Reassured, I have mathematical research that can cost me all my energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Mathematical research... Are you from the tower?" Fernando’s emotions were slightly relieved when he heard about magic-related things. He asked with interest, in his impression, the tower geometry was the first to make himself The magic of learning to suffer from setbacks, and the magician in the tower is full of fanaticism in mathematical research, just like Douglas in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians of the ancient magical empire have long begun to pay attention to mathematical research, because this is closely related to the construction of the spell model. And achieved a series of results. For example, the tower geometry, but most of their energy is still on the study of spells and blood, after all, the results of mathematical research is difficult to see, only a small number of magicians use them as fun. Most of them are astrology divisions. The Tower is one of the most famous astrology divisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the Twilight War broke out. The church began to gain the upper hand, and it was even rarer to have a mage with free research. At least Fernando had never seen a guy who was so enthusiastic when it came to mathematics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked up. Self-deprecatingly laughed: "In fact, I really want to join the tower, but they don't want me to be a strange guy. After the fall of Antiller, I have never seen them again."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very glad that you have been able to clearly understand your own weirdness. If you can ask less why, it will be a very good friend." Fernando is always willing to blow others, even if It is a ** division, and he will not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and did not respond to Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland complained about Fernando, why did he make up for his mistakes every time? Does he not talk to others without sarcastic? Bai Sheng has a pleasing and beautiful appearance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed: "Mr. Douglas, don't worry about Fernando, he is a descendant of Arthur's barbaric empire, he can hear it from his accent, right, you If you need something, you can make a list in these days. If you have a particularly urgent situation, tell me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Douglas shook his head. I watched Fernando and Roland leave, clearly knowing that when they come back, it is time for them to accept the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the forest silently, Fernando and Roland did not speak, but they changed the hidden place very tacitly and hid in the city. Going to the villa of Viscount Erekan - this is their safest hiding place, only the place where the highest level is known, and the place that the night watchers can't imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nobleman has not yet inherited the baronial title, he hooked up with a high-ranking mage of the "Sorcerer Union" in the action of destroying the magician Going up, and then using his power to eradicate powerful enemies, successfully acquired the title, and later three times and five times to rely on the "intelligence" of the "Sorcerer Union" to establish meritorious service, became the Viscount, is the "Sorcerer Union" implementation The first one that has been drawn up since the new strategy is the weight of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Roland have changed their appearances for a long time. They are familiar with the appearance of the Viscounts, and they have passed through the main entrance. No one doubts, because this is indeed them. It is their identity on the bright side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler kept the silence as always, and asked the two guys who often accepted the special orders of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his room, Roland just washed it and heard Fernando’s familiar violent knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something? Discuss how to test Douglas?" Roland asked puzzledly. After a few days of intense life, he just wanted to take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando's spiritual field spreads, closes the door and screams: "Roland, we must fight back!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassination of vultures?" This is something they have discussed before, so Roland responded after a moment and cautiously said, "We have to make a strict plan to use other people. The whereabouts to lure the vultures, and then kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Fernando's bright eyes are full of seriousness and anger, "Benson defected, we How many people are here, the black-clawed dogs are very clear, maybe it’s not that we kill the vultures, but they kill us. You know, this insidious means is the specialty of the black-clawed dog, and I still want to Kill Benson together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? Benson must be hiding in the referee now. We can't bring him out to kill!" Roland He did not hesitate to veto Fernan’s proposal, "Or else we will wait a second. Contact the headquarters to come to a few high-ranking magicians, so that you can confidently kill the vultures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando controlled his anger and shook his head: "The vulture's sense of smell is very sharp. After a few days, he will not be so recklessly raided, but will act in conjunction with local aristocrats and clergy, and even rush to other regions."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Roland asked inexplicably, and that didn't work either. That's not OK. What does Fernando mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando almost growled and said: "Direct attack on the referee, kill the vulture and Benson! They must be there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You are crazy!" Roland felt that Fernando was crazy, that he was crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magical empire still existed, there were indeed instances of breaking the referee and even the cathedral. But this is a hundred years. No other magician dares to attack the referee directly. This is the black-clawed dog's lair, with a powerful divine array and high-ranking vigil, where a magician who flees like a mouse in the gutter can hit his mind. Suicide must also choose a good way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light breeze blew, Fernando’s slightly messy hair floated like a prelude to the beginning of the storm: “Since you can’t think of it, the church and the black-clawed dog are even more Unexpectedly, for more than 100 years, the referee has not been directly attacked, their reaction will be slow, and it will be very chaotic at that time. We can calm down the vultures and Benson before the church and the nobles react. Leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this...can, but our strength..." Roland felt that his brain was in chaos, and that it was indeed a vulture and a dream. Unexpected things, I think it’s too crazy to be too funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not smile: "We have a sergeant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
