			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solna River flows quietly, giving birth to one-third of the souls of the Eldo Peninsula, forming a number of river valleys, of which the name of the river There are several city-states in the Erna Valley. They rely on abundant water and fertile land to become the bustling place behind the city of Beritan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "War of War" temple in Husum City is a wide square, with a half-height platform built in front and surrounded by linen robes. The people, they spontaneously gathered and embraced the gods of their own faith, and the Anglooma empire soldiers of bronze breastplates lazily guarded outside, turning a blind eye to a small number of faith disputes, and seemed to want these pagans to kill themselves. Still the world is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the semi-high platform, Luna, the god of thunder and lightning, the god of wind and rain, the goddess of the earth, the master of the underworld, the god of the sun and justice, the god of wisdom, love and The priests of the eight remaining Martyrs, such as the goddess of breeding, sit on the silver chair and wait for the debate to begin. This time, if the power of their own gods cannot be overridden by other gods, they will become the last three gods. First, it will be expelled from the valley by the Lord of War, losing a stable source of faith, gradually declining, and finally absorbed by the corresponding gods of the Angloma, completely degenerate or become an incarnation of the other. <br /><br />###################################################################################################### But no one dares to resist, this is the end of the betrayal and the loser, and for them, this road may not have no hope. After integrating the beliefs of the Solna Valley, the power of their own gods will inevitably increase greatly. The time is absorbed by the corresponding gods of the Angnoma gods or vice versa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lord of War" priest sitting on the golden throne above is a beautiful brown-haired woman wearing an Angoroma-style white robe with a hem Open to the waist, from time to time to show the slippery legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the second main sacrifice of the Temple of War in Bolitan, and also belongs to Nina at the high priesthood level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the Lord of the Great War, the lord of all battles and destruction." The sixteen priests of the eight gods saluted, just as they faced The main god, Afando, is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nena personally danced a dance of war to please the gods, and then solemnly facing the bottom, it is necessary to announce the beginning of this "theology" debate. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, two black-haired men dressed in washed white robes stood in front of the semi-high platform and shouted loudly to the guard soldiers: "Let us go up, we represent The great resurrection, fertility, and redemption gods come to theological conferences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There has never been this god name, it must belong to the pseudo-god, guard, expel them. !! Nob, the priest of Luna, is sternly scolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Luna’s Ashin’s strength is in the middle of the eight gods. Can you be the last three winners? It’s hard to say, in the face of inexplicable Competitors, wearing noisy old man Nob will naturally not have a good face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis as a "follow-up", using his eyes to signal Lucian to quickly speak the words of preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not afraid to meet Nob’s eyes: “Our resurrection, fertility and redemption god can participate in this meeting is by great The decision of the Lord of War, not the Luna, you rushed to speak before the Nyna High Priest, is the Moon God in front of the Lord of War?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Slightly surprised to pick up eyebrows, this is not the words of discussion before, but in the current situation, the effect seems to be better, can more effectively provoke the relationship between the moon and the Lord of war, more powerfully angered Axin, To achieve the real purpose, "This Leviathan has the ability to play on the spot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Such a big hat buckled down, Luna Nob, the high priest, was furious and could not speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien scared Nob, and stopped other priests’ speeches, "seeingly" to Nina: "Respected high priest, follow The god of war, it should be that all the gods who preached in the Solna Valley are eligible to participate in this meeting. I wonder if I understand it wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Nina was as cold and short as a female warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to make your own proof." One of the gods has no influence on the arrangement of the Lord. Instead, it can make the contradictions more sharp and beneficial for future annexation. Therefore, Nena has no objection and succinctly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his right hand, and Anxius, hiding in the dark, applauded gently, and the original "Flame and Destruction God" secret believers in front of him Raise your hand and praise the resurrection, the rich and the redeemed god El. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob and the other priests of the gods glanced at each other, not knowing that this strange resurrection, fertility and redemption god had secretly preached in the valley. I am too much of a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not expect this to be the embodiment of Afando, because before Francis’s opinion, according to the understanding of the gods, the important surname of the priesthood exceeded the name of the god. It means the strength and the number of spells, so even if they change their names, they will not change their priesthood. After they have annexed other similar priesthoods, they often change the name of the gods and turn the "vest" to annex the original faith. The "flame, destruction" of the priesthood seems completely irrelevant, and the resurrection, fertility and redemption are hard to associate with Afando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the priests and believers, Lucien took Francis to the newly added silver chair and listened to Nena: "This time The theological conference is to debate the power of the faithful gods to identify who is the true God, who is the false god, who is more worthy of faith, according to the god of war, all things are three, and the final winners are only three. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence, regardless of the extent of the final debate, the winner is also obeying the god of war. In the hearts of believers below, it is clear that the Lord of war Be higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My Lord is the embodiment of the sun, shining everything, dispelling the darkness, like a flame, symbolizing the power of light, and also the power of punishment, while He is the rule maker, bound the gods, and bound the humans, so there is no doubt over the other seven gods.” The priest of the Sun and the God of Justice preemptively described the power and power of the gods. Come out to win the yearning for believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers who did not receive any education nodded lightly, the sun hangs in the air every day, makes people feel warm, and forms a strong contrast with the darkness. Importantly, the god of the sun and the judiciary must also be strong, and believe in him may have more benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consul of the underworld sees the change of the believers below, and immediately stands up: "There is life and death, every intelligent life can not get rid of the shadow of death, and life It is short-lived, but death is eternal. The great underworld dominates the world after death and is the final destination. It is of course more important than other gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fear of death is what everyone naturally has. When it comes to the darkness, coldness, pain, and eternal sleep after death, it seems that the rule of the underworld is much more useful than the god of the sun and justice. Just by listening to the description, you know his power and important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The earth carries everything, the underworld also depends on it. The earth is still nurturing life, giving birth to death. Anyone who angers the earth god will suffer famine and earth. Move, the mountain collapses." The earth god god priest threatened the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the sleep after death, real life seems to be more important, especially the hard famine that many people have experienced, and the horror is like the earthquake that the world destroyed. Let them fear and fear, and dare not deviate from the faith of the Mother Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods dominate the horrible lightning and can kill every soul of every individual. Anyone who violates him will be struck by lightning."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If you turn away from the god of rain and wind, He will drop forty-nine days of continuous heavy rain, let the sea rush, let the river flood, let the mountain flood, let The whole earth became a country of flooding, and all living beings were destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the priests used skilled intimidation to intimidate their faith. The priests who love God and the god of wisdom are hard to contend with, and they can only withdraw from the controversy with a pale face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t hold any hope from the beginning, just a few words of wisdom can make people get rid of suffering, love and reproduction can continue to ignore the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a stronger debate, who has a stronger blow, there is no philosophical speculation, Francis seems a bit uncomfortable, he controls the air fluctuations, secretly Lucien said: "Wait a minute to say whether you want to anger the Lord of war, how to describe the great El, how to describe it, is the cycle theory of 'creation, control, destruction, resurrection'."
