			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study room of the "Hull" manor, the thick curtains retreat to the sides, and the white gauze covers the window, allowing the sunlight to come in and create a golden splendor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri took a quill, sat behind the desk, seriously calculated what, from time to time raised his head, and communicated with Douglas and Fernando in simple words. If the things I want to express are too complicated, she will choose the combination of verbal and text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas in front of the window, his face is condensed, like he is thinking, pacing back and forth in the golden field shaped by the sun, occasionally suddenly stopping, pointing out Fernando And where Hathaway’s thoughts were immature, she hit the nails and pointed to the key points. When the two of them proposed new opinions, he again picked up and looked like a meditator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sat on the sofa in front of the desk, floating in front of a stack of white paper, a feather pen in the case of unmanned, self-contained On the surface, the calculations are written. Whenever he thinks of something, he will speak loudly, and he will not lose sight of it if he mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them explored the arcane, and the scene of exchange of magical knowledge is like the same oil painting, which is vivid and rich in connotation. Unfortunately, no one witnesses, no one recorded this magic history. A scene of awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discussion has been going on for many days, and Fernando and Hathaway are perfect for all the doubts about gravity, the celestial motion system, and the three laws of motion. Answers, and each has a rich harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I applied calculus to a nine-ring spell, I found that the construction was much less difficult..." Fernando waved the parchment in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this piece of parchment that has been magically processed, shadows and rays coexist, and the pattern of the spell model presents a unique three-dimensional effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only is the nine-ring spell. The magic above the three rings will be greatly simplified in the construction. If it is said that the difficulty of constructing learning magic in the past is one hundred. There are only sixty left now." Douglas replied in a round-trip whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at the parchment in his hand and suddenly said: "If the calculus is completed twenty years ago, then the Master and the High now The number of magicians will definitely increase a lot, and the combat power of the same magician will double."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas paused and turned to look at Fernando Road: "How are you recovering? How is the mastery of calculus and gravity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem for the time being." Fernando answered affirmatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded. "That troubles you to contact other organizations and express our willingness to unite. But at the same time warn them that they would rather have no materials in recent years. Completely hidden, can't try to act before the conflict between the church and the nobility reaches a peak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The group of cowards, don't dare to dare them!" Fernando disdainfully Said, then put away the quill and draft paper, and rationalize the clothes, it seems that they are ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Fernando is an action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas turned his head. To Hathaway: "Haysea. You should also return to Rantat. Staying here for a long time will make the church and other nobles doubt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well." Hathaway replied softly, but the quill in his hand did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took a sigh of relief: "The half-face closure of 'The Lord of the Deep Cold' and the Eye of the Curse is hidden. So, I have to go first. A glimpse of hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief gathering. The three men embarked on different paths for the future of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the candlestick fell to the ground, fell into pieces, broken The candle flashed a few times and then went out, the whole room was in a dark state, and only the beast-like lotus sound echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl gasped heavily and did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shirley, call, calm, call, I am not a magician, believe me, I am not a magician!" The breathing of young men is equally heavy, like It is a blacksmith's bellows that is pulled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl named Shirley slowly suppressed her breath, and the young man unexpectedly calmly replied: "Vicente, you are calm, whether you are magic or not. Teacher, I love you the same. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like a magical spell, and the dull and depressed atmosphere in the room disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente’s eyes seem a bit weird and can see things in the dark, so he quickly lit the desk candlestick that was just slapped by him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light once again filled the room, Vicente had put the heart in his hand, wiped the blood of his hands clean, and rushed to the girl snow very quickly In front of Li, excitedly asked: "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley's two rows of neatly broken teeth bite the lip and solemnly nodded: "I don't care. What is your identity, I am only worried about losing you, the church will not let the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente haha ​​laughed and laughed like a naive The child, and turned around a few times, then he hugged Shirley and kissed her horn: "Reassured, I am really not a magician, I will not be a magician for you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the body..." Shirley pointed out with fear that the dead body was placed on the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente converges with joy and clears his throat: "I found some magician's relics on the edge of the swamp. There is knowledge about magic, there is The mystery of the human body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, I was really attracted to the magical magic, but I thought of you, we knew each other, you ignored the identity of your nobility. Secretly taught me the lingua franca text and the text of Hillanas, helped me find the work of the doctor of the good hall, in order to marry me, refused one of the outstanding nobles, and made the uncle and aunt very unhappy, how can I Can you abandon you and embark on this road that is destined to hide from Tibet?" Vicente explained that he added a sweet talk, and heard Shirley's mouth screaming, trying to keep his smile from leaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles of this period will still learn the words of the magic empire in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I re-buried the books about magic on the edge of the swamp and only took back the books about the mysteries of the human body." Vicente pointed out A few books spread out on the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley wonders: "The mystery of the human body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente's expression changes Seriously, the tone is soothing and sighs: "I have contacted too many helpless patients in the sacred hall. They have no money to ask the priest to treat with the gods. They can only rely on the herbs and the formulated medicines that we doctors have prescribed to cure the disease. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outsiders may not be very clear, but as a doctor of good hall, I understand very well that these herbs, these medicines, can only treat minor diseases, slightly serious A little patient, I have to watch them mourn, scream, and walk to the end of life little by little, which makes me feel bad, makes me feel powerless, so the doctor of Shantang either slowly changes It’s cold, or it’s a madman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shirley snuggled in the arms of Vicente, caressing his back: “I understand, you know I often go to the charity to help, and I have seen many deaths. Even many patients are still children, they die like this. In front of me, at that time I only hated that my faith was not pious enough to be a nun and could not get the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I always wanted to find better Formula, but I found that the human body is full of mystery, what is the structure of the heart, I don't know, there is something in our body, I don't know, how the whole body works, become a whole, I don't know, how is this possible? Looking for a better formula?” Vicente’s eyes are full of yearning, and the whole person seems to be able to shine. “I want to understand the mystery of the human body. I want to figure out what our body is!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looks at this kind of Vicente and thinks that he is more attractive than ever, and gently sighs: "This is a good thing, but you must not go to the graveyard to disturb the deceased. Peace, that will, it will be discovered by the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
