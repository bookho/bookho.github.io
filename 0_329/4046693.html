Lucien also determined the judgment of Rhein from the magic feedback. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cardinal of the Vaolirit diocese, an ambitious conspirator, has lost his ** and soul under the gods of God, There are only mysterious fragments left, but there are a lot of secrets hidden in him. For example, why can he use God descending, what he got in the world of the door, why he can escape from the monster, and the angel What kind of cooperation is Wang and what is the mysterious fragment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein laughed: "The world I entered the door was originally to track him, but after losing the clue, I lost the clue. Who knows that I will give up completely? When I was ready to unravel the mystery of the monster, I accidentally discovered his traces. The fate is unpredictable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that we are the most important at present Or go to the Tanos Labs and figure out the secrets of the monsters.” Lucian also wants to track the “Sard Fragments”, but here is the world of danger everywhere, you must firmly grasp the main direction, not free Distraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein has no objections and laughs at himself: "You come to open the door, I am worried that I am miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien would like to say that we are almost the same as when I met "Ivan". In professional terms, the hands of two people are too dark, but I thought about the opening of the Rhine. "Paradise Mountain", this is more powerful than it is, but nodded: "Well, at least the objects I met after opening the door are still within the scope of escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;All the way back to calm again, the horrible monster seems to have forgotten the two, but as he gets closer and closer to the Tanos laboratory, Rhein suddenly pauses and wonders: "It is a trace of the mysterious fragments..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde has only mysterious fragments left, unable to erase traces and breath, and being touched by people entering the same hall is taken for granted, but in the world of the door In the same hall, the probability is needed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the destination of Thrall also Tanos Lab?" It was a coincidence that it was a coincidence. When I met twice, Lucien couldn’t help guessing everyone. There is only one reason for the "shun", that is, the destination is the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein maintains an elegant smile: "Most likely, I have been very curious about his experience, and I can use God's Falling Skills inexplicably, maybe secretly Hidden in the Tanos laboratory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three gray halls, the two unsurprisingly found the breath of Thrad in one of them. Traces, more and more certainly guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Lucien and Rhein stood in front of a black door with no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the door is the Tanos Lab?" Rheinland has little confidence in his computing power and seeks confirmation from Lucien, an expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded: "Mr. Rhein, be prepared, maybe there is great danger inside, my destiny star has always given me a sense of alert ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the lab of a top magician must have a guardianship." The title of the Rhine is "observer" and the adventure is very rich. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and suddenly there was a black door that moved a little and made a slight sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Rhein have been guarding that some people are coming in, and the subconscious will launch an attack. After a slight noise, the door is still tightly closed, not open at all. The signs, as if they were the auditory halls of the two before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I smelled the breath of Thrad." As a blood prince, Rhine has an extremely keen sense of the breath of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to come in?" Lucien said subconsciously, "No, he just left here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In the last hall leading to the Tanos Lab, Lucien and Rhein also discovered the trace of Thrad, so he thought he had entered the laboratory, who knows, he went next to it? And also deliberately turned back to make a move? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien shook his head. "Is it necessary? Is it okay to ambush directly in the Tanos laboratory? This is where we have to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Suddenly, Lucien’s heart moved, with an inexplicable hunch, so he took out the crystal ball and cast astrology. He unexpectedly got a fuzzy result: “Following Thrad...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This?" Lucien and Rhein looked at each other with the same surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like, we tracked? After more than three minutes, no matter what happens, don't delay exploring Tanos Labs." Stars Magician There is a certain degree of recognition of the results of his own prophecy, so Lucien made this suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the general theory of relativity, his astrological ability is greatly improved, not worse than the first-order "prophet" occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein thought for a moment, strangely silenced, and then nodded: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp So, the two carefully pushed the door that rang out of the sound, and unexpectedly found the residual Sald breath, and then followed his breath, passed through two gray halls, and stopped again. The fan has no strange places in front of the black door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossien, who has been calculating the coordinates, suddenly surprised: "This door is also the Tanos Laboratory!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you back in a circle?" Rhein laughed and was teased by Thrard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "This should be another entrance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sa Dear wants to lead us into this entrance?” Rhein converges with a smile, and several legendary items are ready to go, and then the black door is pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slowly opened backwards, a magnificent laboratory appeared in front of the two, full of mysterious patterns, three-dimensional models, weird magic array , a solemn array of deities, and a broken mirror on one side of the gray wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lab is the size of the entire Nexus Palace, with many walkways leading to different rooms, with fragments scattered on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of laboratory can give people a shocking feeling, because there are traces of damage everywhere, as if there was a legendary war here, just because of the lab fans The super-defense of the lock did not destroy the whole, but even so, most of the patterns, magic arrays, and magical arrays were erased, and the alchemy platform was flattened to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pure and burning glow around the laboratory, which is the boundary of the lock, but in front of Lucian and Rhein, there is a road through the lock It seems to be the secret passage opened up by the predecessors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Salde wants to save us time to destroy the locks?" Rhein entered the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed closely, observing the surroundings: "But his breath has disappeared here."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave me alone, there should be experimental records in other unspoiled rooms." Rhein calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of one of the grey rooms had an open sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is similar to the rest of the world in the world, it is difficult for the mental power to spread to the back of the door. Whoever can't find out is the two, so they are scattered. Be prepared to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the grey room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Flame of the Source" Banham sighed a long, half-easy and half-bited: "I finally recovered... Lucien?" Evans, Natasha Vauririt, I will not let you go, even let me lose all the legendary items, relying on things that I don't want to use are not completely degraded!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Derrick who gave him a fatal blow? Douglas, he subconsciously chose to forget, because the gap is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you return to the holy city of Lans, you apply to the Pope to apply for a legendary item." "The Flame of the Source" thinks about the arrangement, gently Opened the door and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
