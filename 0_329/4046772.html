			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient flame of the ancient sorcerer’s body was smothered by this crystal clear grating, and immediately lost its color, as if it could absorb all the light and warmth. Deep black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light column is scattered and turned into countless silver currents and transparent lasers. They are dense and looming, forming extremely visible eyes with extremely strange flow trends. The intricate grid trap completely shrouded the "Lord of Fire". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this illusory penetrating "big net", everything is frozen, everything is in an unimaginable state of silence, it seems Even microscopic particles are difficult to vibrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wonderful scene begins with the flames of the "Ancient Fire Demon" and instantly spreads to its body surface and spreads under its demon scales. Spread to its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Fire" is like being caught in the "advanced time stop", there is no place in the body, and suddenly its body becomes transparent It makes people clearly see its "devil core", a flame that seems to burn forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of "flames" is struggling to withstand the miraculous state of invasion, but it is so powerless, so unpredictable, quickly swaying The state changes to a quiet frozen appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the molten sea connected to the "Lord of Fire", the flame seems to be still burning, but there is no temperature, revealing the deep cold of the heart, Then, they were frozen and became a dark ocean of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all so fast, Gonheim, who is always on the battlefield’s “dark master”, can’t rescue the “Lord of Fire”, it’s short After the horror, things can't be recovered, or when it sees the icicle hitting the "Lord of Fire", it is clear that the legendary third-order demon king will be completely degraded, because Lucien casts himself. Never heard of the legendary magic "Forgiveness of the Snow Goddess", because this magical crystal clear light column makes the far away "Frozen Fortress" onlookers also feel an unparalleled deep cold! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level of cold seems to reach the limits of the world, mastering the power of ice and darkness is also after the legendary peak, relying on the feedback of the abyss and its own Talent ability, only to get to this level of ultra-low temperature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it saw the "Forgiveness of the Goddess of Ice and Snow" when it hit the "Ancient Fire Demon" that had just taken off the high-temperature flame defense, and gave up the plan to rush to rescue. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ultra-low temperature, which is within one degree of the "absolute zero" critical point, obviously cannot exist for a long time, is rejected by the whole world, plus here is "boiling" The ocean" So less than one breath, everything began to melt, and little by little, disappeared quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Fire's translucent body is still solidified in the air, and the feet are stepping on the sea where the surrounding magma re-emerges. At this time, the boiling ocean will never calm down. The fiery storm blew through. So its entire body collapsed and seemed to become countless particles, completely dissipated in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient sorcerer who has lived for a few years has finally reached the end of his life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boiled Ocean" spurted a magma fire column straight into the sky. The entire plane erupted like never before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the horrible magma condenses in the air into a throne of fire, all the flame lords who fight the ice lords, the snow elves, the frost giants All red eyes look back, this is the call of the abyss, this is the call of killing, which flame lord can defeat all the competitors in this state, the sorghum throne, it will get the blessing of the entire plane strength , to receive the reward of the abyss will become a new "fire master", of course, only the legendary first-order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blizzard, two figures appeared, one wearing a black double-breasted long dress, wearing a black top hat and a right hand as seen in the banquet Holding a silver-colored pocket watch, it seems to be calculating whether it will delay the banquet, a purple long hair shawl, silver gray body armor flashing cold and cold taste, right hand carrying a long sword with the same color, holding the left hand Small and delicate black shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this emptiness, the void in front of it cracked, and there was a boiling sea of ​​molten mud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Fire Lord" accident is not in its plan, it does not prevent it from achieving its purpose, because it did not expect it." The ancient sorcerer can really block the well-prepared Lucien = Evans - after knowing that there are only two roads into the "chaotic starry sky", Lucien = Evans does not target the "master of fire" Prepare, there is every reason to doubt how his IQ has become a great arcane master and legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the "Dark Lord", "The Lord of Fire" is just a primer, so that he can intervene in the name of helping his subordinates, blocking Lucien = Evans for a while, so that the plan that requires strict timeliness can go smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to normal and rigorous logic, the ancient sorcerer is the master of the boiling ocean, and its character is violent, it will certainly block all the creatures passing through here, and he is ancient The devil's "supervisor" is attacked by his men, and he will certainly help him. In this way, Lucien = Evans will not know that he deliberately blocked him from taking "spatial slate", but as this in the abyss. The inevitable encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gonheim’s right hand is in the outer hall of the frozen fortress, and the beautiful face of the crystal ice wall highlights it. The little devil's horn seems to absorb all the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have considered it, although your promise can't make me too satisfied, but it's better than nothing, and <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Time and space slate, it is of no use to me." It said to the illusion of the same group of people in front of the illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clemente came forward this time, but also made a corresponding cover, which can be reflected in all sides of the frozen fortress hall. When he was in the figure, he still had the feeling of being seen through, so he couldn't wait to leave, but the "dark Lord" Gonheim did not give a reply! It took 10 minutes! !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing Gonheim’s answer, Clemente breathed a sigh of relief: “The dark Lord of honor, your choice is very wise.” Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t hear that the newly promoted demon prince is a “dark lord”, you can negotiate the existence of an exchange of interests, and he will not go to “frozen fortress” and “abyss After the fusion of the stomach bag, the "desperate world". After all, at the home of a legendary peak, it is possible to completely fall down with a little carelessness. The former "Devil Prince" is far less interested in plans and interests than killing and destroying. favorite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Dark Lord does not agree, then I can only find a way to lead the Lord of Fire. From the 'boiling the ocean, enter the ················ On the other side, with the help of Gonheim, he jumped into the "chaotic starry sky". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth and fifty-fourth floor of the abyss, "Boil the ocean." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiery red sky splits, and the long, straight hand of a nailed blackberry stretches out and brings out the boundless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This darkness is different from the darkness created by all the people that Lucien has experienced before, including the last "Devil Prince". It is like a cosmic starry sky. Where there is no light, it is a real, thorough darkness, filled with the deep cold that freezes everything. No, it is deeper, deeper and colder than that darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some mythological stories, when the whole world, including the stars, goes to the end, it is not a volcanic eruption, not a crack in the earth, nor a flood. Gradually lose the temperature and light, then fall into the dark, fall into the deepest cold and fall into the eternal silence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the guys who like these myths have found the so-called "theory" in the thermodynamic theory of the Magic Council, that is, the heat of silence. Of course, the orthodox The surgeons had also had concerns at first, but then they found that they were more headaches than this and the increase in entropy, which seemed to indicate that the universe would eventually reach the end of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such darkness and cold, the blizzard seems to be irritated, and it is concentrated into a small group, like the purest and coldest heart of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, this small crystal slammed into the boundless darkness, seemingly to freeze this darkness completely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
