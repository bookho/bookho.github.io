			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich darkness falls on the "frozen fortress" and "the sea of ​​strong acid", just like the curtain of the stage set off the new demon prince "Dark Lord", surrounded by The void still resounds through the pain, anger, hatred, and bloodthirsty screams, as if the chaos and melody melody written in the Dark Proverbs cheered for Gonheim to the throne. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another layer of the abyss, there are countless strange undead creatures in the middle of the wilderness, a palace built by a huge skeleton, a palace above, a draped The black cloak's illusory monster looks at the "sour sour sea" direction and floats quietly. It is dry and skinny like a skin-only face, and two pale, empty eyes faintly burning a vain flame<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intersection of the "Blood Plain" and the "Abyss Stomach Bag" is gradually separated, and the "Dark Lord" Gonheim has no other movements. For it, this time with Lucien, Natasha and The Malfurion fight is meaningless. He has just swallowed up the "core" of the former demon prince and got the "abyss" care and "feedback". He succeeded in the advanced legendary peak. It is the time to stabilize and rush to open the battle. It will only give other demon kings the opportunity to look at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that it has been promoted, Lucien has not reached the idea of ​​"frozen fortress", not to mention that "the dark Lord" is close to the class in his "home" God, the hidden thing behind this thing makes him dare not care, and the replacement of the "Devil Prince" is not dangerous for the parliament, unless the Elf Queen really falls completely to the abyss - this with the toes Everyone knows that it is impossible, and there is no problem in temporary cooperation and utilization. If you are in a long-term alliance, anyone will be worried about the chaotic demon who betrayed the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold, dark ocean and the frozen fortress everywhere disappeared into the sky, and the "blood plain" returned to normal, except for the fragmented and burning demon corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario looks at the "blood king" who cannot be effectively defended by the "Sword of Truth" attack, watching the remains of it, Did not say a word, fell into a deep silence, "natural arrow" suddenly shot on the "natural altar" made him understand a lot of things, the heart is very complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out that the 'Dark Lord' was planning behind the scenes, I wonder how it gained the trust of the demon prince." Natasha put away the truth of the crack on the surface Shield, watching the blue sky as the dust is cleared by the "eternal blaze," the pure and brilliant sun shines, extraordinarily and lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and said with a funny voice: "I can't simulate the idea of ​​a chaotic demon. Maybe Gonheim found the weakness of the demon prince. But what is hidden behind this thing deserves our vigilance. Wicken seems to be a god-like method secretly announced, spread in a legendary hand that he has carefully selected, so that one can expect In the fierce battle in the future, the situation will become extremely complicated, and I wonder if there are many conspiracy and killings in full brewing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be legendary magicians inside the parliament! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two people’s conversations are not connected through the mind, but they are open to the outside world. By the way, this information is told to Malfurion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the arrangement of the natural altar, the pollution of the elves, the demonization of the elves, and the transformation of the state of magic in the 'world of the door' But, hey, maybe not Pope Wicken? The monster Viken is also possible.” Natasha said with a smile, she knew everything from the door to the world of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Malfurion suddenly said: "You mean, Her Majesty the Queen cooperated with the Dark Lord, conspiring to calculate the demon prince, and with the help of Its arrangement transformed the state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be like this." Lucien beheaded slightly, no more to say, see the wreckage of the bloody king and the demon prince Most of the "eternal blaze" lost vitality and vitality, so only a few pieces can be used as experimental materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the Abyss gap, Natasha uses the soul to connect: "The Elf Queen is definitely planning the road of the gods, will it be against the parliament and the kingdom? What constitutes a danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is danger, then kill it in the bud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Elf Queen should have successfully transformed the state and mastered the mystery, and Viken’s method needs to accumulate the power of faith in order to become a god. The number of elves can only be expanded outwards. However, she is more likely to succeed with the help of 'natural feedback' and 'natural deity', and it is easier to succeed, and the parliament is strong, while the sea is relatively weak, she is not difficult. Choose the direction of expansion." Lucien analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First of all, the success rate and danger of this road will not be mentioned. When she accumulates enough faith to promote, the development of arcane will certainly be able to take on another real road of gods without hidden dangers!" Lu Xi's tone Plain but full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled twice, without inquiring, and then her expression was positive: "In such an era of rapid development, I am not satisfied with becoming Epic Knight, I have to work harder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she shook her fist with the name of the surname: "I must catch up with you and let our active passive relationship return. On the right track!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and glanced at her, "provocative meaning" is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just returned to the "natural residence" and entered the misty The forest, Lucien, Natasha, and Malfurion heard the soft and clear voice of the Elf Queen: "Two distinguished guests, thank you for your contribution to the elves, thank you for finding the real murderer Lan Hill. , cleaned up the suspicion of Ferragad, please come to the Elf King Court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha looked at each other and felt The kindness of the Elf Queen, while paying close attention to whether the lock is open, and if there is something wrong, use "reunion" to return to the "atomic universe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafalion flew silently in front, and entered the palace of many tree houses on the fairy tree, which is exquisite but not luxurious, Atlante, especially Magicians such as Risian, Felipe, and Heidi are already sitting in their seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand was injured on the excuse, did not attend the banquet, but after his inner hate sentiment was instantiated and eliminated, the hostility to humans was also weak, naturally The hateful party will probably become a nature protector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emperor Queen" Aglecia is still wearing a green leaf weaving a long skirt, and her mouth rises with a smile: "Please allow me to thank the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her slender figure slightly illusory, Lucian and Natasha nodded secretly, she really completed the state transition, just because she could not control This state, so the external manifestations of anomalies, but she has greatly revealed this anomaly also shows the attitude of frank cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, Forman, here are the fruits of two elves, and please accept them, the gifts are more expensive, and you can’t be grateful with our hearts. "The Empress Queen said to Lucien and Atlante, and they took out two green branches of braids in the same way, which gave off a faint scent, just smelling it, Lucien The hair is wide open and feels so refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf prince Exeter, the elder elder Malfurion has opened his mouth and seems to subconsciously want to stop because the elf tree is long and long As a result, there are only a few at a time, and the use is still very much, so there are only three left in Wang Ting Bao Li, and this is two-thirds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they all restrained the urge to stop, no matter what the truth behind the matter, the surface is indeed the parliamentary magician "save" the elves fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not polite, he has taken the scorpion politely, sincerely thank you, with the fruit of the elf tree, plus the "not old spring", you can arrange A “natural gift” ceremony that you and Natasha can use at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Queen saw the two legendary magicians accept the "gift", and the other magicians also received different thanks from Elsett, so Once again, I smiled: "Evans, since the sound of mystery can be heard in Stroop Forest, we know the current state of the development of arcane, and many elves are very interested in it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This novel and the unfamiliar life of the elves is still very popular with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored." Lucien answered with a smile, probably guessing what the Elf Queen wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrea gently daggers: "Our elves have never been conservative and stubborn races, have been learning the merits of other civilizations, so I will not stop them from Arcane and magic are interested. On the contrary, I hope they can go to Allinge to learn, let us really understand the arcane and eliminate misunderstandings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
