			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Joel, Eliza, and Avon, are they all right? Are you saved?" Lucien didn't suppress his emotions, rushing Asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance is the most normal performance of an ordinary person after hearing Natasha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has killed the Jensen and the Cavaliers attending the prison, so that the Silver Horn has lost the ability to kill the hostages, but dare not directly Rescuing, so as not to expose their true purpose, so after leaving the ruins, has been fearful, afraid that the Joel family was killed by the fighting of others, so the emotions are really sincere, just right, will not let anyone doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is slightly awkward, likes the charge in front of her, regardless of the identity and safety of the princess and the countess, directly following Camille in the Black Forest Looking for the conspirators, and then the first time with Camille rushed into the underground relics, fighting and chasing the cultists, and the rescue of the hostage is only handed over to another knight who followed, but the end is not bad: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I returned, I confirmed that all the hostages, including your uncle’s family, were rescued. We encountered a sudden, cult retreat very hurried, so I didn't have time to hurt them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be relieved." Lucien showed a tired but satisfied and happy smile. This rescue operation is completely In the tightrope, every link is a little wrong, that is, the result of the firearms or the rituals of the heart, and ultimately the success, in addition to the advantages brought about by information asymmetry, there is no small luck component, I only hope that it will not be Encounter this high difficulty High-risk things, "What about Uncle Joel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille Tinathasha replied: "Their bodies and minds have been severely affected. The trauma, being treated by the church, and asking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, Lucien, they are victims, the church just wants to ask something about 'silver Corner 'the caretaker's thing, huh, aunt Camille, you raided the 'Golden White Horn', the sword of the high priest actually caused such a big echo in the ground, almost fainted these weak and poor people, I don't know When can I become a Knight of the Sky," Natasha added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien’s grasp of the timing, the sound of the Camille avatar slamming the ground was only two or three seconds before and after the “Humman’s cough”. The hostage ear in the sealed cell is completely echoed by the same sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien strangely asked: "What is the silver corner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kidnapping your uncle's family, threatening your group of bad guys, they are the devil's followers, claiming to be the silver horn, you have to be careful with them later." Natasha explained: "Their hearts have been completely blinded by the devil, before the hunt In the end, as soon as they are discovered, they will immediately scream "by the eternal silence" and blew themselves up, and will not give us a chance to catch them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, Natasha has a snack, although she benefits from the mixture of the two best blood and her own genius, only one step away from the Knights in her twenties, and also has a lot of combat experience, but she is after all The noble princess has never encountered too much danger and such cruel and shocking things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of this emotional influence that she will say so much with Lucian to relieve repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't catch those bastards?" Lucien asked with concern and hate, feeling that his acting was very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s head is slightly lifted, and the suppressed emotions dissipate. I am proud of it: “I grabbed a priest in the silver corner and then learned by some means. Part of their purpose, the depth of the underground remains sealed the right hand of an evil powerful person, but unfortunately they have been taken away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pursue Among the people who went there, Camille, Amorton and Gossett let the two high priests "escape". Others did not even see the backs of the cultists. Some people watched the priests and the priests blew themselves. Only Natasha caught one with a strong strength, which made her feel very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said: "Don't know what other purposes are? Why do they want to inquire about your Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille added in a cold manner: "After the end of the hunt, the church has notified the remaining bishops, pastors, night watchmen, and arrested all the personnel in the intelligence department, believing that they can know something from their mouth."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the kidnappers who followed me?" Lucien asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha pointed out: "Maybe he got the warning of 'the silver corner' and escaped in advance. Well, Lucien, I By the way, I want to say a word to you. The strength of 'The Silver Corner' is beyond expectations. If you do not destroy their plot in time, it will cause irreparable damage. Oh, when you tell me, actually I only have Half believe, but after the investigation, I completely believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my glory." Lucien answered politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Camille’s look suddenly solidified. After nearly a minute, he turned to Natasha seriously: “All the problematic intelligence personnel The clues point to the Viscount Stuart, and the Viscount Stuart committed suicide before the bishop and several counts rushed over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things There was a big change, and Camille didn't care about Lucien, who was next to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Stuart is the highest person in charge of the intelligence department of the Principality, a quasi-day knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha subconsciously waved her right hand to the side, her arm screaming crisp and pleasing metal, then she squinted, with a lazy smile And the dangerous momentum said: "Perhaps there is a real behind-the-scenes black hand behind the Viscount Stuart. Who is it? What is his purpose, why should he risk the church 'cleaning up' to collude with the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, she remembered that this was the room where Lucien lived, so she wore a pair of armor gloves with shimmering white metal and waved to Lucien. "Things are more troublesome than I thought. I have to go back to Latava Palace to deal with it. If you motivate the blood, I will tell the church according to the previous agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the meal, Natasha apologized apologetically: "But you are only the power of the quasi-knight. According to the Code, it is difficult for me to authorize you as a formal knight, to grant you a title, and if you spread things out, others may just be jealous. But the remnants of the Silver Point’ are willing Can guess that you are whispering, and then mad revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will put you in great danger, and the personnel of the Principality of the Principality and the church watchman This time, I suffered serious losses. I am afraid I will not be able to provide you with reliable protection in a short period of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a few months, this incident caused After the impact has faded, I will give you a manor by excusing other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is too expensive..." Lucien unconsciously To refuse, because in the heart, Aalto is not a place to settle down and build a home. In comparison, giving money or material rewards is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha waved her hand and said very seriously: "As the owner of the Violet family, as an earlord, I have never been a jealous person, my The Cavaliers' as long as they have made contributions, and with credit, I will definitely give the equivalent of rewards and encouragement. Fair rewards and punishments are the cornerstone of the Vaolirit family for more than a thousand years. Lucien you can't let me lose this. Good virtue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this time if you don't get the information in advance, I am afraid it is difficult to let the Silver Horn suffer such a serious setback, huh, huh, although your intelligence It’s a long way to go, but it’s better to catch up. Lucien, how did you judge the position?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows that this will be asked sooner or later. Come and quickly say the reason that I have long thought of, that is, from the "Ball of the Scene", I saw a small bird called "silver throat" outside the forester’s hut, and most of the birds Anyone who has gone through the mushroom in the Melzheim Black Forest knows that its most common location is the "Kekike" mountain peak. Veins near the forest, of course, see the "silver throat doves" does not mean "card humble Ke" mountain Mountains, elsewhere it is also possible, such as this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha nodded, wearing a helmet but not pulling the hood, the whole person is even more heroic: "Things are so good, wait a few In the month, I will find an excuse to give you a manor. As for the excuse, Lucien will quickly write a piece of music that I like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
