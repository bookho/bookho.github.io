			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart’s late night is not much different from other cities, except for the cathedral and the aristocratic settlements, where the sun shines, and the rest rests on silver. The moon or the stars "illuminate", so, in the darkness of the five-finger, the extreme silence of Lentat is only occasionally flashing past the lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep Blue Gift" Sharp stood at the floor-to-ceiling window of the bedroom, watching the darkness outside, without any darkness worthy of appreciation, just like it was The most important meaning of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his right hand and stroked the bump like a tumor on the bridge of the nose. The crystal blue eyes were stained a little, and others may not know the referee. The giant Alfonso has led the people to leave, going to hunt down the "Destroyer Tower" magician, but as the deputy head of the "Sword of Truth" Knights, the Duke, the great aristocrat, one of the king's most trusted subordinates, nine The Golden Knight, he has enough channels to know this fact, so he is waiting for the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, the footsteps of the fast running came, mixed with the sound of the iron boots hitting the ground and the collision of the nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of the group..." The knight who came to ventilate the letter and gasped, and he only rushed to Sharp from less than a minute. The villa, "The Heart of Time" was seriously injured and returned, Alfonso and all the clergy and night watchers he brought to death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time of Time Heart?" Sharp did not control his expression, and did not understand how it would be related to Ketonia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the news from the inside of the Glorious Cathedral, the specific situation is unknown." The knight said quickly, "Headmaster, Ketonia accused you Collusion with the magician, assassination of Alfonso, he can't save, can only save his life, he wants you to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal family in Holm Inside the parish, it is very expensive to buy some of the bishops who are not strong enough and inconspicuous, but who can get and transmit some intelligence at key moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afghan has doubts, or someone has sold an action plan to Ketonia, but since he has all intervened, why is Alfonso still dying? Why is he seriously injured?" Sharp seems to be in a state of sorrow, forgetting that he is in danger, and wants to break his mind and not want to understand what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The knight who reported the letter suddenly fell on one knee, and the armor of the knee slammed into the floor, slightly crying. "The head of the group, you flee, the church will definitely not let you go, they need an action failure. 'Sacrifice', they will send you to the firearm! You will be acquitted if you hide under the King's Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...if I fled, and it is equal to confessing the crime. I don't believe that the church can condemn a duke's death sin without evidence, only the magician is full of nonsense, which will make all nobles afraid and chilling." Sharp silence After a while, it converges on doubts, embarrassment and worry, as always, with the temperament of the leader, said to the Majesty's knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of the action, the arrest of a magician and the sale of himself is a situation he expected, he is fully prepared, believe in Under the blessing of His Majesty the King, he would not have anything. The only thing that made him a little uneasy was that the accusation came from another Duke, the epic knight, and the weight was much heavier than expected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, the floor-to-ceiling window made a slight noise, a group of fires flew from a distance, directly penetrated into, became a fierce big man with a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The head of the group, flee! There is a cardinal proposed to arrest you!" He is the deputy of Sharp, the seven-day Knight, "burning the devil Flame "Gu Gufu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp’s right hand is quietly clenched, and the tone is still flat: “Don’t worry, this is a routine arrest and interrogation. They have no evidence, I won’t have anything, if now If you run away, you can never tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, can't believe in the church. In the past, they directly tried to kill a few who were just suspected aristocrats!" Although the "burning magic flame" Gu Gufu admire the deputy head of the group can remain calm and calm at such a critical juncture, but this can not quell his anxiety, perhaps "God Angel" Franz will come in person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp shook his head, and his left hand quietly clenched the handle of the sword: "Those are the nobles below the count, and I am the Duke of His Majesty the King." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount." Sharp is a little bit moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a flash of lightning broke through the sky, and there was a young man with a thin hair but roots in the bedroom. He had a silvery body around him. Electro-optic entanglement, twilight and skin color are unusually rare silver: "The head of the group, Glorious Cathedral decided not to arrest you, but sent a cardinal secret to comfort you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is another deputy of Sharp, "the penalty for sterling silver" Cesc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The voice that surprised me was "burning the flames" Gu Gufu and the first knight to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation has changed?" Sharp, who is the leader, is equally astonished, but on the surface he is still trying to pretend to be calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The penalty for sterling silver" Sesker shrugged: "I don't know, the core news has yet to be inquired, maybe they decided to respect the nobility..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a strong irony in his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long for a cardinal to arrive, and he conveyed to Sharp the condolences of His Excellency Franz, telling him: evil magic The "death lord" set a trap, seriously injured the lord of Ketonia, killed Alfonso and other clerics, and deliberately spread this is his cooperation with you, trying to destroy the relationship between the church and the nobility, but "the angel of grace "You are the saints of the Lord, wise and upright, and have no influence by rumors. Please also ask the deputy head to be provoked and to believe in the justice of the Lord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After smiling and sending the cardinal, Sharp turned into the bedroom, his face became extremely dignified, and the three subordinates of "the penalty of sterling silver": "There must be something else going on, go check it out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably understands that this action is a trap for the magician, the goal is not at all. Fangsuo, but the "heart of time" Ketonia, even the "death lord" this once legendary peak has been dispatched, hundreds of times more than what you expected! Therefore, it is impossible for me to pass through such a light weight. There are certainly other factors that lead to such a result, and this is likely to be a far more important event than the impact of this incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three of them left, Sharp took a step back and forth, and even the mood of watching the night outside was gone, and the faint anxiety spread uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky suddenly lit up and the lightning flashed away. "The penalty for sterling silver" Cesc appeared in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp controls the mood and maintains the image of his leader: "What did you hear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The war broke out in Tria. His Majesty the Pope used two gods down, repelled and reinvented 'Silver Moon' Etna, and killed Abel..." Sesker's face was full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Sharp can no longer maintain his image, exclaimed, "Silver Moon" started? Then was it defeated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceske refused to repeat and continued: "But the Pope’s uncle was in poor condition and returned to Lance, the legendary magician, the blood prince, the Taigulong, etc. After Tria, he launched an attack directly against Lance, and the situation was anxious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a step further than the previous "God Angel" Franz said, Because the new information has been transmitted from Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be like this..." Sharp whispered, then comforted Seske, who was a little scared. "Unless there is a kind of god, do you not have Lance? It’s easy to be broken. When the Lords on the front of the Tria return, things will be smooth, but I don’t know what the Pope’s Majesty is doing...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very Fast, "burning the flames and flames" Gu Gufu returned: "Headmaster, the "King of Angels" pavilion descended on the holy city of Lance, with the god, the guardian of God blocked the time of the ancient dragon Danisus, Dracula, elves The attack of the legendary powerhouses such as the Empress and the 'Sun King'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Sun King" is only a legendary third-order, not the original Tanos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The head of the group, His Majesty the King, St. Griffith, St. Ivan, 'Shield of Truth', Rudolph, etc., rushed back from Tria, Completely repelled the attack of the magician and the Dark Alliance." The first knight finally came back and brought the latest news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
