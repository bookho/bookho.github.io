			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the bright but not hot sun shines into the Downey's bedroom from the window, and it is dyed with golden color. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s eyelids pacing back and forth, seemingly unable to sleep at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the voice of the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher School of Magic" announcement, even if he is quite confident about his play, but he is inevitable without a retreat Uneasy, tossing and turning, it is difficult to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay, whether it’s a theoretical subject, a spell test, or a test, I’ve done it well, unless all the best apprentices of this year have applied for Heidler. Magic Academy..." Downey whispered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, when the bell rang, melodious, Downey’s body stagnate, and quickly opened the “home TV” inlaid on the wall, only the snow above The white spots are constantly rippled, revealing a beautiful fairy with a pointed ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the first time to watch our 'Good Morning Nature' program, I believe that you are waiting impatiently in front of the TV, huh, I am in the hand Holding the list of admissions to the major magic schools this year.” The elf on the TV picked up the parchment in front of him and raised a red string with a raised magical coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the school channel of the "Nature Heart" Magic School. There is one hour of programming every morning, noon and evening, mainly to inform each happening in the school. Kinds of things, "distribution" of all kinds of bad or funny mistakes made by apprentices, as well as the need to introduce nature protection, show the natural beauty of the place, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the roll, I don’t know how many layers of parchment. Downey felt that his heartbeat was getting faster and faster, and even if he held his breath, he could hear it beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf put down the parchment and smiled: "Our apprentices have performed very well this year, and the percentage of admissions is higher than in the past. Of course, there are definitely some people who can Success, but don't be frustrated, you can choose to enter Stroop Forest. Druid's further studies. Under the years of hard work of the Arcanists, magic apprentices can easily be converted into 'natural guards', that is Druid apprentices..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words were heard by Downey’s forehead, and the most important thing at this time was to publish the list. Say so much to do? Accumulate everyone's anxiety and anxiety? Provocative everyone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this elf lady has not much nonsense. The seal of the magical coat of arms was quickly removed. The red rope was broken and the parchment was unfolded: "The admission list of the Holt School of Magic is announced below. Apprentices who have been read the name should go to the principal's office after 9:00 to receive the admission letter and reward."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only nine current schools of magic. There are almost three or four hundred magic schools around the world, which can be accepted. It is a glory for apprentices and schools. Therefore, the principal of the "Nature Heart" Magic School will personally issue the admission letter. Therefore, apprentices entering the magic school are expected to become formal magicians as long as they are not lax, lazy, and give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holt Magic Academy..." Donnie’s more eager to listen, the familiar names deepen the feeling, but the elves The anchor did not read the admission list of the Heidel School of Magic until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey held his breath again, pressing his right hand on the left chest and feeling the fierceness that seemed to jump out of the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Guderian...Caroline...Davi..." The Elf’s anchor sang a name that was familiar to Downey. When he couldn't stand the heartbeat and the terrible pressure, the word "Donnie" finally came out from the speakers of the home TV. It was so sweet and so beautiful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie is like being struck by a lightning bolt, his body is tight and his muscles are stiff. Then he gently arms his arms, but his body is weak and soft. inverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally succeeded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The life of yourself and your family will change from today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Heidel School of Magic, body structure and genetic factors." Downey, no matter who he saw today, smiled brilliantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the research in the microscopic field becomes more detailed and deeper, with the establishment of the essence of the world and the model of the essence of magic, as this influence spreads to various fields, The arcane masters have discovered that the vastness and vastness of knowledge has surpassed the limits of their own learning ability. They can no longer learn the basics of each faction as before, and then choose the field that they are good at. They must be clear from the beginning. The direction of development, lay the foundation from the beginning, it is not difficult for geniuses to take into account other aspects of their own field of basic learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, when you become a middle or high-level magician, after the life is extended, the arcane masters have to go back and relearn the stars, elements and the dead. The foundation of the three factions, the former involves prophecy, destiny, etc. If you don't learn, you are very disadvantaged. The microscopic field of the elemental faction is the embodiment of the essence. It is the basis of many studies in the future. If you don't know anything about it, the deepest direction of your own direction. Research is likely to be difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Necromancer is a necessity to prolong life. This is not a requirement to be proficient in it, but at least a corresponding basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros gently daggers and closes the book in front of him: "Congratulations, Downey, I hope that you will achieve remarkable success in the Necromancer in the future." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Dorothy." Downey replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros looked at the bookstore and saw no guests at this time, so he laughed and said: "Donnie, the Necromancer is currently solving the soul model. The three major problems of the genetic factor model and the 'original body' real principle, if you can uncover the veil of genetic mystery, you will surely win the Evans Arcane Award and the immortal throne prize, you may not become a great arcane master, legendary magician, This is the direction of your efforts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny scratched his head and was very embarrassed by Dorothy’s encouragement: "This is what I can solve, I There is no foundation at all. Hey, Mr. Dorothy, do you know the 'original body?'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is keenly aware of this unusual word, quite curious Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros lowered his gaze and looked at the book in front of him: "Have you heard of the 'original body'? Even in the system of the dead, you know it. There are not many Arcanists who are still studying it. I also know that an old friend is trying to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am In the unified entrance exam, I heard a candidate mention..." Downey suddenly felt that this problem was a little dangerous, but he could only answer it with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros whispered and smiled: "Since you have heard of it, you can tell me in detail, this is the ancient Mes Kate Empire..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably told the origins, evolution, etc. of the "original body", Downey also listened very carefully, even though he has been Carl "Popular" has passed, and Carl's description is more detailed, but at that time he had the mood to listen carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The characteristics of the return to life rituals are the oblique tombstones, the corpses without corpses...all the bodies are filled deep into the core Inside the buried wood..." Dorothy sighed and said: "I heard that the 'Nongmong Cemetery' outside the Heidele School of Magic contains this secret, but unfortunately I am not qualified to visit this most Mysterious and unique magic school..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide the secret outside the Heidler School of Magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie is looking forward to the life of his magic school. If he can find the corresponding information, he will crack a mystery from the "Nongmong Cemetery". The strength may be able to increase rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorothy coughed, no longer mentioning the "original body", and speaking the story of the Necromancer in a general way, sent Downey Go to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long magic steam train stopped on a gloomy platform, and Downey took his old black suitcase and couldn’t wait to get off the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
