			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Click for a request, ask for a suggestion, and collect for it on Monday<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................... .....................................................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Eliza Home, Lucien did not immediately go to the market area, but went home to get a stick, continue to exercise in the open space and practice basic swordsmanship, before the mental strength is not enough to continuously display more than a dozen magic, a certain melee and The ability to dodge is still very important. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the better the physical exercise, the better the chance to stimulate the blood power when you have the opportunity to refine the "Crying Soul" magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour of exercise, Lucien went home and wiped the sweat, which went to the market area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without five days without going to the market area, Lucien felt that it was still very lively, with a variety of accents, various appearances, different kinds of people. Type creatures, mixed together, full of exuberant and awkward life pulsations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fear of revenge by the Aaron gang, Lucien is very careful in moving around, plus the faint inspiration of the spirit, guaranteeing that it will not be easily tracked, or even If the gangsters are within five meters of themselves, they will be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But actually, when Lucien bought the casting material and left the market area, the Aaron gang did not come to find any trouble. Instead, Lucien noticed When Aaron’s gangs didn’t charge a fee, they’re a lot less. They used to be two or three people in a group of actions. Now they are all single-handed, which makes Lucien very confused: “Is it the last thing, let Aaron gangster decided to keep a low profile?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guess, even Sean himself does not believe, but no matter what, the Aaron gang’s abnormal behavior, or let Lucy I decided to be careful and learn most of the apprentice-level informal magic as soon as possible. Although their destructive power and defensive power are not too strong, they can be ingenious, as long as they are used properly, Lu Xi’s thoughts, even if they encounter Ten gangsters, who can handle themselves without the long-range weapons such as bows and skeletons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the market area, Lucien walked for three hours before buying three kinds of casting materials, because the last time was the Aaron gang The experience discovered, Lucien is more cautious, even if some materials are very common, but their current life is not used, they are not bought for a while, and many materials can be found in the wild, such as the fruit of the cypress Red pattern rock powder, etc., so Lucien decided to find a time to go outside the city to collect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kinds of casting materials bought by Lucien are that they can deworm and repel mosquitoes, and the use of frequent sulphur in the "Fire of the Fire" can calm the mind. The night sky grass that helps sleep - after becoming a musician's student, it is too normal to buy this kind of plant, as well as calcite with a fresh-keeping effect and refreshing effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kinds of casting materials, Lucien each bought enough weight for a hundred spells, the most expensive is the night star grass, followed by calcite, Sulphur is the cheapest, and it took a total of twenty Westminster, a Silverel, and nearly half of Lucien’s property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to make Lucien feel: "Magic is really expensive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the "acid splash" and "frost ray" are not as low-key as the "out of control ring", leaving traces that are difficult to handle, and daytime Ade asked people to come and go, the environment is complicated, so Lucien did not dare to display in his own house, ready to go to the evening, like the witch, find a sewer entrance, practice in the depths of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At two o'clock in the afternoon, Lucien went to the Victor home on time to continue his yesterday's delayed study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, do you have a job now?" After an hour of study, Renee, Colin, Anne and others left, Victor suddenly said I asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were only four students in the hall, Lott, Felice, Herodotus and Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Mr. Victor, my previous job was lost, and I haven't found a new one yet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your family's condition, even if I am exempt from your tuition, I will still have an impact on your life from 2 to 6 pm every day." Victor discretion, he asked Colin and Bud before. Nie, knowing the poor people of Lucien, if you want to live, you must keep at least ten hours of work every day. Although you don’t know where Lucy’s tuition was obtained before, you can see his dress. Life is definitely not big. Improvement, "I just know that there is a relatively easy job. I only need to work four hours a day in the morning. I can get ten Yinnar incomes in one month. Will Lucien be willing to go?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really helping me find a relaxing job. Victor not only makes himself a real student, but also saves tuition and cares about his life. In the heart of his heart, Lucien once again felt his emotions. After he arrived, he met Jackins and other villains and scum, but he also met Uncle Joel, Eliza, John, Victor. Good man: "I am willing, Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't listen to what work is promised?" Victor said humorously, "The association's The music library, originally had a person management every morning and afternoon, but I feel that there is only one person, it is easy to make mistakes, so it is recommended that the association add two more, I did not expect the association actually agreed. Well, when you manage the library, you can Try to read the book on getting started with music, so that when I teach you, you can understand it faster. After you have a week of introductory study, you can try to learn the instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Victor's thoughts, because I don't know Lucian's talent, I am going to let him learn the instrument as soon as possible, become a musician as soon as possible, become a musician, have a stable source of money, and if there is talent, then It’s not too late to learn more about deeper content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stayed for a while, didn’t expect to be so close to the library, traversed in the library, took the library in the soul, and appeared to be a book The administrator of the museum, but soon, Lucien was grateful: "Thank you, Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job is a musician The association’s addition to Victor’s face, working four hours a day, and having ten Yinnar’s income in a month, is a very good thing. You know, the original Lucien, from morning to night, Tired and exhausted, only three Yinnars in a month, now directly from the bottom of the poor to ordinary civilians, which fully reflects the important surname of the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor took a clap: "I just prepared to bring Lott, Felice, Herodotus to the Association Auditorium in the afternoon, and practice playing with the orchestra. Sean, you followed me to the hall to sign a contract document, and you can start working tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Victor went to clean up his messy, recorded many inspirations When the melody of the paper, Lott smiled at Lucien: "Know, I am Lott, Lott Griffith, Mr. Victor is a very good teacher, and very kind person, I hope you don't let him down. Expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne was suddenly accepted as a student by Victor. Lott had an anger and dissatisfaction, and he was one of the Griffiths. The clerk, who wants to study music with a poor person, who does not understand anything, who has not received any education, and who wants to embark on the path of elegant and sacred musicians, is really a shame to the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from Mr. Victor’s words, Lott heard that he wanted to make Lucien a musician, so this anger and dissatisfaction was relieved. It became a self-proclaimed aristocrat, and released the goodwill to Lucien with a condescending attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Victor should be happy to see that his students can get along well." Lott, who wants to be a true disciple of Victor, thinks so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not interested in what Lott thinks, he has chosen the path of magic, and the intersection with them should not be much, so polite Answer: "I will, thank you for reminding, Lott. Well, my name is Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Felice? Haien." Red-haired girl Felice held a cold and cold nod to Lucien. She didn't think that Lucien could make a lot of achievements in music. After all, it started too late, so Luthi became Victor. The music student’s affairs are not only concerned with Mr. Victor’s goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And release too many good things, Lott can do, but Felice can't do it, if a rumor with a poor friend is passed out, for her The reputation will be a small blow, and even affect the choice of marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
