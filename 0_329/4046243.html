			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magician Management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took Lucien’s Arcane Badge from the magical cage, and the four silver stars above it looked mysterious and vast against the dark background, as if they were hidden There are countless mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of 708 arcane points. Even if Evans has no other arcane thesis in a short time, it will be able to become five in a year or two. Level Arcane Master. Eric will update the badge of the Arcane Points to Lucien, and get used to the stiff expression with a clear feeling. "You will be the youngest five-level Austrian in the Magic Council since the Arcane level. The surgeon, but it is also the lowest level of magic in this level of arcane division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Eric, a third-level arcian, four The difference between level 3 and level 3 is only two hundred arcane points. I have the confidence to hope and hope. After years of hard work, there are only thirty-six points left in the fourth level. The fifth level is so far away. Then can't be touched. When he suddenly saw a young man who came to Aringe for less than a year and hoped to become a fifth-level arcane master, he was inevitably a bit embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of the Arcane Master is not only related to the importance and treatment within the Magic Council, but also the potential and prospect of the enhancement of magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the magician himself is not proud and complacent, he is on the road, not relying on age accumulation to raise the level of the arcane, without encountering cognitive bottlenecks, etc. There is great hope that the magical power will eventually rise to the same or even the level of the Arcane. And when the Arcanist breaks through the middle to high-level squad, the Magic Council will certainly provide magical rituals, so Eric seems to have seen a high-ranking magician who is about to grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took over the arcane badge, slender fingers pinched it and flipped it for a few times, and smiled slightly: "Mr. Eric, thank you for your Looking forward to it, the facts of these two months show that the good times of the crazy growth of points have passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the discussion of human life mechanics in the previous project brief is in full swing, So when the journals at the end of the month of the crouching month (February) were issued, Lucien’s arcane points soared by 158, of which only forty-two of the atomic weight data from the periodic table was re-measured and re-measured. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after February, because Felipe’s experiment and the “miracle experiment” that followed the natural primitive environment were considered to be the key to overthrowing human life mechanics, Lucian's experiments on synthetic urea were rarely cited, but the reference integrals of the periodic table and the re-measured atomic data expanded with the completion of previous research results of the Arcanists, contributing one hundred and four in two months. Thirteen Arcane points, and papers on alchemy materials to help increase grain production have nearly ten because of the introduction of other similar substances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the last two or three months, the rate of increase has dropped rapidly. The reference from the periodic table and the atomic weight is stable around ten papers per month, so Lucien judges In the future, there will be a long-term flow of water, but there will always be but not too much. It takes about two years to become a five-level arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Periodic Table of the Elements is the basis that the Arcanists cannot circumvent in the field of each study element, even though most of them can cite subsequent papers, but each month You will also give Evans a lot of Arcane points. When you become a Level 5 Arcanist and the level of magic is increased to the 5th Ring, you can come to me to apply for a high-level magical ritual help. Rick slightly politely, "Evans has a higher level of arcane than me, and I will not be used to the title of 'you', you don't have to be so polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he took out the magic badge and gave Lucien: "There are only two more arcane points from the new magic learning and 45 monthly subsidies from the parliament."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the Magic Council, the first-class Arcane Division subsidizes a Kintal or an Arcane Point material every month, the second level is five, and the third level is twenty. The four levels are forty, the fifth is eighty, the sixth is three hundred, the seventh is five hundred, the eighth is nine hundred, and the nine is two thousand. Law level, too, both can be superimposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien first put the arcane badge on the left chest before taking the magic badge of the two black rings, the whole person feels a refreshing, this is Because when the Arcane Badge is upgraded to Level 3 or Intermediate, it has a constant magical effect of relieving soul and physical fatigue, and when it becomes a high-level Arcanist, it can be constant, as is the Magic Badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Eric, please allow me to leave, I need to go to the exchange area to buy materials." Lucien picked up the chair next to it. The black top hat is slightly sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe didn't expect to meet Lucien. After a slight sigh, he gently rubbed his jaw and looked at his left chest. His face showed a gloomy smile: "Your arcane level and magic level are not there. Growth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened to Felipe’s sentence and felt a bit wrong. He also looked at the badge on his chest and saw the black of the simulated starry sky. There are already five introverted and deep stars on the bottom of the Silver Star Arcane Badge. There are countless light spots flying around, and what is even more amazing is that the black badge on the silver background of the magic badge is full. There are six! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High-level magician..." In this generation of genius, Felipe finally surpassed everyone first to become a high-level magician, and the whole pale The number of high-level magicians of the hand is only in his early forties, even if he counts the lich who has lived for a long time. This means that Felipe really became the top of the pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe did not wait for Lucien’s answer, and inserted him directly to pass him by, leaving a whisper to a seemingly incomprehensible statement: Don't be thrown too far by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien pulled the corner of his mouth and watched Felipe leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Go back to the hall of the Magician Management Department along the corridor, Cindy licked his beautiful eyes against Lucien, and then used it very formal The tone said: "Mr. Evans, there are guests looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will find me? Lucien questioned the sofa next to Cindy's right hand and looked at the sofa next to the bar. I saw a middle-aged man sitting in a ball. He was holding a handkerchief and rubbing the creek-like sweat. The hot weather at the end of July has been going on for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Arthur Doyle?" Lucien didn't understand why the president of the Holm Mining Union Bank suddenly came to find himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur threw the handkerchief to the glamorous slim lady who followed him, this is his blonde private secretary, then in the two seemingly fierce bodyguards I walked up to Lucien’s face and held out both hands with enthusiasm to hold Lucien’s right hand: “Mr. Evans, I’m here first, you can listen to your butler and say you go to the Allinge Tower. Come, so I rushed over and sweated, stinking. Otherwise I will give you a courtesy of hugs instead of shaking hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This fat man is very polite and pays attention to the details. Lucien secretly swears and raises his affection for Arthur: "Mr. Doyle, don't know what you are looking for?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur's fat face showed a warm and kind smile: "Mr. Evans, let's drink something and talk slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy went to the bar and poured two cups of iced "Sky Blue" to Lucien and Arthur, then stayed beside them curiously, ready to listen to this. Why Lun Tate famous Regal came Lucien, did not he wanted to support the unlimited potential, great prospects genius arcanist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Dona is equally curious, but she can’t leave at the reception desk alone, so she looks at the road and seems to be playing Lucy. Cindy of the role of Secretary. Cindy turned his gaze and pretended not to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur shakes the dreamy sky blue liquid, gently sips and screams loudly: "It’s so refreshing, it’s hot on me. It disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he glanced at Cindy and seemed to think that there was no need to keep it secret, so she was not asked to leave, and then filled with a smile: "Evans I am looking for you today to seek cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Lucien swayed the glass in his hand, letting the sky blue liquid sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur beckoned to ask the blonde secretary to take a stack of thick documents from the bag and hand it to Lucien: "Mr. Evans, I am going to Sariva. The town has seen your experimental fields, the production of oats and other food crops is beyond my imagination. I don’t think there is a nobleman, a manor who can reject your alchemy products, and I know from the Highness of Prince Patrick that you already have A large-scale synthetic scheme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the inventor, you legally enjoy the natural right to dispose of these alchemy substances. The rules of the Magic Council, if we set up a company to produce and sell these alchemy substances to other counties of the Kingdom and other countries, we will cooperate with the Magic Council with 15% of the shares, and you will share 15% of the shares. You and the Magic Council have a Kintal, even if it is the cost of hiring a magician to arrange the Alchemy. We will be the best partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
