			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic badge that turned into a three-ring black ring to the mission area to receive the details and location of the "Demon Mission", Lucien did not directly Take the magic steam train to complete the mission through the newly opened “Arinle-Kappas County Capital” route. Instead, call a carriage at the mouth of the Magic Council, and take it slowly to the “Elemental Will”. Liner's Division Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This task comes too early, it seems a little embarrassing, and you are a person who is backed by the organization, of course, let the organization "identify"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study at the top of the Magic Tower, Gaston, who stayed at Allinge to preside over the affairs, clasped his hands and listened quietly to Lucien. The content of the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon’s deep yellow eyes passed a whimsical emotion, and then used a somewhat old but majestic voice: “It should not be a dangerous task, three The demon and the demon who can be summoned by the ring magician are limited in strength. Evans has an 'element' ring. Even if you can't complete the task, there is no problem to escape. But for safety reasons, I still ask Florensa first, she may know More insider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used his eyes to indicate that Lucien sat here waiting, and he stepped into the cubicle of the study room with "Fernando's electromagnetic communication. "Work with" Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took this opportunity to recall what he had done in the Magic Council during this time and found that there was no power or magician who had the will to circumvent the will of the element and deal with it. . The matter of human life mechanics has ended, and the pale hand has barely reached the goal, and will not bite the "professor" any more. The regulations for purifying the pollution magic circle did not harm the interests of the magicians. More is, the Magic Council took out part of the money to subsidize, and it is impossible to blame yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the church, their eyes and hatred were basically sucked up by Felipe, and it’s meaningless to use a spy that has been cleaned up and saved. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think this task can be considered without subjective harm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Gaston opened the door of the cubicle and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used the Holm Kingdom’s unique unhurried gentleman style to sit still and smiled at Lucien: "I asked Florence It’s a sudden mission, there should be no danger. But Evans is the most promising of our generation of magical sorcerers, and also successfully promoted the middle-level magician within a year, so I borrowed you one. Magic items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon took out a monocle with a beautiful silver-gray chain from the drawer: "There is a constant five-ring magic" Fernando Electromagnetic communication', if you find it wrong, contact me immediately. My specific frequency and password are the same." He said, he tore off a piece of white paper and wrote information on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Storm Masters has considered simple encryption when inventing this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, according to the guidance of Gaston, left a spiritual mark on this monocle and then received the gold-rimmed glasses on his face. The double-breasted long dress has a pocket on the right side of the dress, and a pocket watch on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing a single pair of glasses, Lucien picked up the black top hat and said that Gaston stood up and smiled slyly: "Evans, congratulations Smoothly advanced to the Third Ring. It is not only an insurmountable obstacle in the ancient magical empire, but also within the current Magic Council, it is also a measure of whether a magician has a solid foundation of Arcane. When you come to this step, it means More than 70% of the magicians. Every month, the will of the element will give you 40 subsidies for the Arcane Point material."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen His income has increased again. Lucien smiled from the heart: "Thank you, Governor Gaston."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Kapas Mountains A place near the mountain pass, the town of Ferrez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very remote town, you need to take a six-hour magic steam train from Allinge to the capital of Karpas, then sit for a long time. The long-distance carriage came to the small town of Tengning, and then it took two hours to reach on the mountain road. Of course, the flying magicians would save a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains are full of animals and trees. Most of the town's inhabitants are hunters and loggers, plus the magician castle that controls some of the veins in the mountains. There are many magic apprentices. , servants, miners, they need a lot of living materials, so the town of Fraser is not as sparsely populated as other remote towns, but it is bustling and slumbering, and even many adventurers and mercenaries come to the mountains. The gems, minerals, exotic plants, treasures, etc. are deeply attracted to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dense wine, the well-informed adventurers whispered the recent events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you heard that? The three-ring magician of the Bertrand Castle was killed by the demon he summoned himself!" The dwarf with a long beard dragged down and asked the companions who had gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man with a sickle on his face nodded solemnly: "The two horrified magic apprentices who escaped from the castle described it as In a hell, a living person was burned to death by flames, eroded by strong acid, torn by claws, and smashed into two sides by a sword, and blood and internal organs filled the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the two magic apprentices who were anesthetized with golden spirits in the corner. One man and one woman had deep fear on their faces and seemed to be trapped in a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we want to go to the castle to try? Maybe we can bypass the devil and find some treasures." The dwarfs of greed have a strong desire to fill the heart of Jintal The symbol, "The magician is a symbol of wealth, and is a mid-level magician, that is the wealth that will make us happy in the next half!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The older middle-aged woman looked at the dwarf contemptuously: "I don't want to bury my future. Didn't you see that even the three-ring magician is dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And the Magic Council will definitely send the magician to deal with it for the first time. Do we want to snatch it with them? Don't think that the mysterious potion you got from the treasure hunt can have the strength of the quasi-knight to fight against the formal magician." The knife and the heart of the man said with a linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the semi-open door of the pub was pushed away, and a young man wearing a black war mage gown walked in step by step. He first used blue. The eyes looked around the pub, and the cold inside meant that all the adventurers and mercenaries couldn’t lift their heads, and then he walked toward the two apprentices who drank the spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sounds, the wooden wine glass was swept to the ground by the young man, the golden liquid filled the ground, and the two magic apprentices looked a little confused. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the battle mage Charlotte, accepting the task to deal with the 'Bertrand' castle, you seriously answer my question." Young man It seems to exude inexplicable majesty, even if the appearance is not ugly, it makes people feel fearful. This is a dangerous atmosphere brought by many battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magic apprentices stunned and the whole body trembled. The female name of the wine-red hair trembled and replied: "Mr. Charlotte, we are Bertel." Mr. Long’s apprentice Susan and Scott, that night Mr. Bertrand tried to summon in the bondage...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hasn’t finished yet, the doorway is again Into a fine woman with short black hair, she wore an elegant purple magic robe, and her eyes seemed to shine with countless lightnings in her eyes. In the middle of the ring, the adventurers and mercenaries were unable to look up again, and then she went to Charlotte: "Hey, I also accepted this mission. I am Sandra, a mid-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlotte, mid-level magician." There are many people here, Charlotte and Sandra have not exposed their specific magic level, and their chest magic, arcane badges, etc. are all worn inside, because no magician wants to fight with people, The other party knows their magical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden beard dwarf next to the bar in the distance quietly looked back and the voice was very low: "The Magic Council quickly sent someone to deal with it." Look at the temperament and demeanor of these two, at least the magician of the four rings, one person can destroy the entire pub, the entire town and the entire castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp These adventurers who have no official knight level have seen very few official magicians, not to mention the fact that the combat power has improved a lot of mid-level magicians, naturally full of curiosity and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I didn't make a mistake." The knife male figure was "bullying" by the magician, and his expression was slightly afraid of authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlotte and Sandra, who are sitting in front of the magic apprentice Susan and Scott, listen very calmly to the adventures, for the adventurers. The arguments are completely unconcerned. They have the strength to be proud of themselves as the basis, accepting the eyes of others to admire and fear is taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of them is even more admired by the adventurous advocates of the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
