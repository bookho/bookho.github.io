			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deliberately revealed his doubts in his voice: "Mr. Ivanovsky? Is there anything to discuss this late? Can't wait until tomorrow? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reaction that a normal aristocrat should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky kept a harmonious tone and said: "A good thing. I know a few good friends with the Vladimir family. After seeing Mr. Peter, you feel very close. And Mr. Peter, you are brave and determined, strictly abide by the knight's creed, is a friend worthy of understanding and deep friendship, so since there are good things, how can you cheaper outsiders, not friends? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good things, at first sight, and so on, the words always give way to a feeling of being a liar, but Ivanovsky is a famous big smuggling. Do you still have to "fallen" to this point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, seeing Ivanovsky has come to the door, Lucien decided to listen to what he had "good things" to facilitate the response. Anyway, as long as you can't afford greed, you won't be deceived. Moreover, this kind of big smugglers rely on contacts and resources, and may not work hard on "acting skills". It is very likely that through his every move, he can see through his true purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, "The Self-cultivation of the Actor" is a god book, and Lucien is licking his belly and using the intuition of the knight to find the Ivanovs. There are people around the base who are hard to sense clearly. But this person appeared as a helper and guard of Ivanovsky, and did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand was on the "frost", and Lucien pretended to open the door normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky is still dressed like a dance party, like a winter bear wearing gold-rimmed glasses, and what he is following is A black suit, black-breasted, white-haired old man, murky black pupils, unrecognizable wrinkles and icy feelings set off a haze. He carried a black suitcase and was shorter than Ivanovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky saw that Lucien himself came to the door and was slightly puzzled: "Mr. Peter, what about your steward? Can't be a knight, a gentleman to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My steward is sick because of the blizzard, I let him rest early, don't hold it hard. I myself are enjoying the moonlight, I didn’t expect anyone to visit.” Lucien explained casually, “Is this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovs The base smile pointed to the old man: "This is my assistant Matt Wei, who has great business talent and has his own unique understanding of the economy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it? Do you know what Mr. Matvey has unique insights into the production, circulation, distribution and exchange of wealth? Do you think that the entire business process has its own rules, like an invisible hand in the midst of everything? Lu Xien asked in a serious way, with a lot of "malicious" inside, this guy is like a thug, a bodyguard is better than a business consultant.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattvi frowned and didn’t answer, Ivanovsky’s smile was on his face, and for a long time he laughed: “I don’t think Peter Sir, you not only focus on the Cavaliers, but also have such in-depth research on the economy. It is difficult to meet you like this aristocrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, I just learn casually A little bit, or else you have your own territory in the future, it is easy to be deceived by business consultants, affairs management personnel." Lucian did not continue to ask, so that the other side can not step down is not suitable for the current situation, just more is a kind Demonstration, don't treat me as a fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky "exposed" appreciation of the expression: "This is a good idea, there should be more nobles to learn this knowledge in the future. Instead of simply handing it over to the housekeeper, business consultants, etc., he is only responsible for inspection and harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also did not mention specific economic content, Under the reception of Lucien, sitting on a soft sofa, Mattvi stood quietly behind him, his eyes became a bit sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien mentioned the red porcelain kettle on the glass coffee table and poured a glass of white water for himself and Ivanovsky: "Ivanovsky Sir, don't know what you are looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky's large hand holding a white glazed porcelain cup is like holding a toy He smiled without drinking water: "Mr. Peter, should you know that Count Witt has the blood of the Vladimir family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky smiled inscrutablely: "So I am looking for Mr. Peter. Your good deed is a title of the count, which is comparable to the legacy of the ordinary duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many mines in the Ural state. The nobles of all sizes are richer than the nobility of the same class in other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? Earl Viter, is he going to be called by the Lord?" Lucien asked in a panic, "This has it with me." What is the relationship?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivanovsky nodded gently: “Calilina is the niece of the second wife of Count Earl, close to the relationship with the Earl. According to her, Nevsky, the Cardinal of the Ural City, asserts that the Earl of the Lord can live for at least half a year, and that he belongs to natural aging and cannot be treated with magic."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of Wetter is a 'wilted' bloodline, which was difficult in the descendants, and he has been fighting with heretics in the South during his prime. After the return of the Earl, there are only one son after three wives, but unfortunately this The young master died before he was ten years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this have to do with me?" Lucien asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivanovsky put down his teacup and signaled Lucien to calm down: "Mr. Peter, you should be clear that the parents of Earl Witt died young because of heresy. And he didn't spur the blood until he was twenty-five years old. Therefore, the distant relatives of the Witt family slandered his property and the title, which made him suffer a lot of grievances, ate countless sufferings, and hated those people. In the process, some members of the Vladimir family doing business here helped him, so that he can safely stimulate the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to Carlylena inquired about the population of the count, he seems to decide to accept a member of the Vladimir family as a step-child, and then arrange for him to be a wife of a Witt family without background forces. And the legacy, let those side members die. This news may be announced in a month, when there will be a lot of members of the Vladimir family coming, why don't we seize this time and work hard at Witt Earl noodles "Let's make a deep impression?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, you are handsome and elegant, polite and succinct, talkative, and very young to stimulate blood, have a knight The identity, I think the Count of Witt will be very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien probably understood what they planned. The Earl's title and half of the Ural heritage, that is the wealth that the Duke of Vladimir will also be heartfelt, not to mention the smugglers of Ivanovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding this point, Lucien asked inadvertently: "Is there a blood of the Witt family on Mrs. Carlyle?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky first glimpsed, then laughed: "Yes, from generations ago. Although it is very thin, no one can deny it. Mr. Peter, Without the cooperation of Carlyle, it is difficult for us to understand the preference of Count Wert, and she is very much liked by Count Wit, and has a say in the final decision. Therefore, we cannot prevent her from benefiting."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A beautiful woman who is such a beautiful wife can get the title and inheritance of the count, I don't think any normal aristocrat can refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the object of Sergei’s scam seems not to be my gold coin and long sword, but to control me through 'this business', but unfortunately I have not greedy. Wait until Carly After Linna’s beauty plan failed, Ivanovsky simply went straight to the door, using huge profits. Straight to the point the temptation. "Lucien mused, can not figure out where there are many doubts, such as Count Witte from the days of knights average of end of life as well as twenty or thirty years, why premature aging? Did he suffer an incurable injury or curse in a heretical war when he was a young man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems that after the succession of the title, Carlylena’s "black widow" reputation will be more loud in a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien smiled and said: "This is a tough decision, but I still have to say sorry, Mr. Ivanovsky, I can't cooperate. You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is a bit of a fan, but here is the Shahran Empire, and he is not a member of the Vladimir family at all, so he is very calm. Refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance ceremony hosted by the Cardinal will verify the bloodline! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
