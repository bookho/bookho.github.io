			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark yellow thick carpet, high ceilings, chandeliers full of candlesticks, exquisite stone statues, lifelike murals and reliefs, bright and warm atmosphere Let the black building resemble a noble villa, not a fascinating "hell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first impression that the "referee" gave Fernando and Douglas after they followed the "gatekeeper" through the tree-lined path full of statues. Formally entered the place where every magician is born from the fear of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, except for Fernando, Douglas, and the "gatekeeper", there were no other referees walking around, but they were aware of the keen sense of the two. There are several people hiding in the dark, they seem to be the first security alert of the "referee". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "gatekeeper" was dignified, slightly squatting, and angrily said while walking: "I doubt your devotion to the Lord, this kind of thing should be the first time Come over and report that if you have delayed the big event, you are waiting for the fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, he calmly said: "If things go well, you also You will get a generous reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adult." Douglas as a singular, Fernando looked down and said nothing, as if he was scared Arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "normal performance" of the "gatekeeper" and the information revealed reveals that the "night watchman" who hides in the dark does not have any move, just using the knight's intuition The precepts of the clergy and the spiritual field of the magician swept through Douglas and Fernando. Without the preparation of the two, this kind of inspection undoubtedly failed to discover their true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Douglas and Fernando did not disguise themselves as ordinary people, so it is not easy to hide the magical fluctuations in the magical array, they are playing ready to sell The low-ranking magician of the companion, this identity is half-truthful, which effectively conceals the facts and does not attract people's attention. After the fall of Antiller, the situation is too much, and it is numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the vigils who are the first warning lines of the "referee" are only slightly curious about what important information is, but they are not qualified to pay attention to such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hall, there is an east-west corridor with two rooms that are either tight or open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a semi-open door, Fernando found that there were ordinary clergy who handled words, files and records, and most of them did not even have the standard priest's standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he looked at Douglas and looked at each other’s thoughts from his eyes and a slightly relaxed expression. The referee was still in accordance with the original The regulations have laid down layers of vigilance and defense, like the strongest fortress, but the perfect arrangement also requires people to manipulate, and the people who carelessly and slackly make it all like nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the corridor, the "gatekeeper" suddenly opened a closed door, there was no decoration in the door, and the ground of the gray bash was directly exposed. A downward staircase is in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the stairs is a stone gray door with simple but full of esoteric symbols, which seem to symbolize different meanings. The crown is linked in a unique hierarchy and way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Douglas’s eyes lifted at the same time and felt its powerful power. This door should be an intuitive embodiment of the entire referee’s defensive divine array. After that, it is almost equal to a nine-level cardinal—the strength of the current church is so strong that only the legend can become a cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tree of Gifts..." Fernando whispered in his heart and recognized the signs of the ten crowns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "gatekeeper" tapped a few times in the fourth crown, the rhythm has obvious speed changes, and there is a sudden undulation Voice: "Who? What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second squad, 'Twilight Touch', today's 'gatekeeper', there are two low-level magicians Please come to inform, the information is very important, I am worried that they have concealed or lying, so brought in to let the captain personally ask." "The janitor" replied clearly, his eyes are sharp and clear, but if you look closely, his pupils have deep Vague divergence and enlargement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman who guarded the stone gate was silent. It seemed to be using the identity of three people outside the core of the magical array. Thirty seconds later, he used a language that was not flat: "Come in."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light shines, the ten "crowns of the gods" are shrouded in holiness, and the door slowly recedes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s heart vomited and was slightly delighted. Although the night watchman came out to interrogate, he could control the other side, but there were many magicians in the referee’s office. Spell fluctuations are easily covered up, and if they are outside, they can only rely on the silver and white lightning and roaring thunder that are now falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gate is a ramp that does not see the end, the guardian night watchman hides in the dark and does not show up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twists and turns with a row of silver candlesticks on either side, but they are not lit by candlelight, but from the holy light of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance is in stark contrast to the gloomy faint sin, which makes people feel depressed and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this ramp, I picked it up. In the wide hall, many people wearing black gloves came and went, and there were also red gloves. The "interrogator" and the "sentence person" shrouded in a dark cloak. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a corridor around the hall. From time to time, there is a sense of magical fluctuations and magical fluctuations. It is obvious that some people are tempering their own abilities or using them to interrogate prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "gatekeeper" and Douglas, Fernando's step-by-step, the referee's personnel did not pay much attention, in their view, there is a formal vigil to lead the way, After passing the previous layer inspection, what problems will there be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "gatekeeper" turned into a corridor and knocked on a door with a black skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in." There was a majestic voice inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Fernando saw a middle-aged man with a slender cheek like a viper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are?" the night watchman captain asked a little angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "gatekeeper" closed the door and repeated the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so reckless next time, first make a preliminary trial on it." The night watchman captain criticized, but not too harsh, then he looked up. Looking at Douglas and Fernando, "Do you know where the 'Dark Storm' hides? Know the headquarters of the 'Sorcerer Union'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He becomes blind Oh, the holy light on the wall began to flow, apparently using the power of a special sacred array to find the answer unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is confident in this, although he is only a five-level knight, but with the help of the divine array, if the high-level magician is unprepared, Will be affected, the opposite of the two low-level magicians are even more likely to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a pair of deep, dark eyes with a starry, holy and charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really know!" The night watchman jumped up and the voice grew a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint magical fluctuations are so inconspicuous under the flowing light, and the mixture is similar to the similar atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman captain pacing back and forth: "This thing is too big, I have to report the 'passer' they! No, I have to ask the 'hunter" Together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agent is the giant of the county referee, and also has high-level strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door and told a night watchman to come over: "Go to the 'hunter" adult and let him go to the room of the 'acterator' adult. There is important information about 'Dark Storm' and the Union of Wizards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman passing by quickly nodded and trotting toward the "hunter" "The room, this adult is just to hunt for the "dark storm" came over! This kind of intelligence must be told to him for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
