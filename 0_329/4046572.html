			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave seems to have no pre-prepared items for immunotoxins and curses for the sake of being realistic and stunned, nor does it carry a potion that can lift the "powerless kiss". At the time of the Duke of James's drink, he could only show a hint of despair and madness with a slightly sluggish eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, magical equipment and pharmacy that can immunize or release the nine-level "powerless kiss", even the Grand Master of the Parliament may not have, let alone the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer of golden dragon scales on the skin of James Duke, the pressure at the top of the food chain is radiating, and his right foot is stepping on David’s abdomen, which will be his The powerless kiss "slightly suppressed and restored his ability to speak: "Tell me? Why do you want to do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special glass bottles with "nectar" When he fell from his belt, David understood that all the plans were exposed. This act of assassination of the lord was an unforgivable crime among the nobility. He had no hope, so he laughed wildly: "Why should I do this?" Do? Not all of you are harmful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We let you assassinate the Queen?" The Duke of James snarled angrily, like a dragon roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davi took a deep breath of two breaths: "What a sweet flower, just like the intoxicating hope, since I was born, you keep telling me, Patrick’s body. It’s not good, it may not last long, and it’s definitely not left. It’s me who will be on the throne in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So I’m constantly exercising Elevate yourself to the level of the knight, always ask yourself with noble morality, constantly moving toward you, to the magic parliament, not letting any influence affect me to the throne in the future, to control the whole Holm, perhaps through Resonate with the 'Sword of Truth' and touch the mystery of the epic knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My life seems to exist for the throne, but you suddenly I gave up and chose this inexplicable queen! How long has she lived in Holm? Has she made even a little bit of effort for the throne? I am not willing, I am not willing! I want to get back what belongs to me! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard David’s madness, James’s face was slightly embarrassed, and choosing David’s training was just an alternative. What he saw was his identity and the tendency to get close to the Magic Council. After Queen Natasha, naturally he did not hesitate to abandon him. Who knows that his desire for the throne has reached a point of madness, which is unexpected, just like how can he not think that a dog raised from a young age will suddenly bite him. The owner has a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a veteran aristocrat, James’s emotions only dissipated for only a few seconds, and he was angry and said: “So you collude with the Dark Council. The man came to assassinate Her Majesty and us? I understand, he will definitely not have time to kill you for some reason, and then you will cooperate with him to blame the night watchman’s fifth-ranked 'curse angel' Gewell, the church To appease the aristocrats of the pro-parliament and the current neutral aristocracy, and to prevent the aristocrats who are biased towards them from concentrating, to break the kingdom, will inevitably choose you to become a king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;David groaned, then laughed wildly, as if he had heard the best laughter, and the Duke of James and Lucien couldn’t help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the Duke of James in front of him, laughing too fast to breathe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really believe "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does he say, what do you believe, how can it be so naive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You think that your golden knight is dead. I can survive if I am a big knight. Who will believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not a 'venom devil' "Lu Xien recalled the false clues that Pirimas had deliberately made before, and the voice said smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien took out the crystal ball and began the divination of Aphrodite's whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the influence of "powerless kiss", David smiled and lost his strength, weak and proudly said: "If he is really like 'venom devil' How can neuroticism and madness come about performing this task? How could you design a few savvy powerhouses? 'The venom devil' is a madman, I am not crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Duke, you have nothing to say wrong. After he kills Natasha and Lucien, he will pretend to be fighting and break the magic defense, let the nobles below find it, and then come in order not to hear it. The legendary strongman killed, can only kill one or two of the aristocrats close to the parliament to escape, so the Duke of James will only die one of you, the rest will live with me, the dark council The conspiracy is revealed, so that the kingdom aristocracy can be kept from splitting and not civil war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball becomes dark, the main star of fate emerges, let Lucy En can't be distracted, but the Duke of James is eager to say: "Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David licked his mouth: "You haven't thought of it yet? It’s so obvious!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really impossible to communicate with the crazy guy, and the Duke of James forced the words of David’s words back:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily The madman laughed and said: "He didn't say it. He blamed the night watchman's fifth-ranked 'cursed angel' Gewell. Do you think he is casually talking? He first picked himself up, he is' Cursed Angel Gewell, a nine-level gold knight with the same kind of demon king blood with the 'venom demon!'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gwell, the night watchman!" The Duke of James looked at the stone statue and stood there, and the forehead vascular violently jumped, turned out to be a night watchman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They violently killed a baron who was close to the parliament, and even dared to call his own big aristocrats! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, the Duke of James is full of disgust and resentment against the night watchman and the church. If it is not necessary for them to balance the magic parliament, he will certainly support the church. The Kingdom of Holm is driven out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with him, he listened to Natasha, Russell, Camille and others who answered David almost the same expression. The only difference is that the latter two There is almost no strength in frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave noticed the face of the Duke of James and smiled even more cheerfully: "I am very angry, desperate for the church? Then I tell you something more angry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" asked the Duke of James sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave smiled very happily: "You don't want to think, a nobleman who is close to the Magic Council wants to know the top ten guys in the short-term with the night watchman. And collusion, is it so easy? Is it not so fast in my heart? I tell you that the nobles who are close to the church confuse me and induce the devil in my heart. Oh, they don’t want the kingdom to fall into the civil war, so let Gewei I pretend to be the 'venom devil' of the Dark Council. When the matter is over, when you recommend me as the King, you will find that the most conservative aristocrats will agree with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "At the time, you will definitely think that they are to appease you! In order to jointly maintain the situation of 'stability and solidarity', overcome the current difficulties!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James The duke’s face was gloomy: “Who is it? Any aristocrat who tries to assassinate the lord must be hanged!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, done secretly but can Most people don’t care, but if they are Wear, it is the challenge of the most serious crimes throughout the existence of the order of nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count of ElBaradei, Duke of York, and perhaps Lord Rex." David replied with a smile, not behaving to sell them, or even add vinegar . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I am unable to climb the throne and are about to die, what is the significance of maintaining the integrity and prosperity of the Holm Kingdom? Let's split, civil war, turn Holm into ruins, this will be the best sacrifice for me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Duke of James became extremely ugly, one word and one word authentic: "I will let the magician, the knight who is proficient in torture, and the judges examine you separately, hope You are not lying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only the Earl of ElBaradei is easy to do, but behind the Duke of York is the epic knight, Kronia, Rex is a conservative spiritual leader If they are involved in this matter, they must be cautious and must not be blind, and David may not be the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
