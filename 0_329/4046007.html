The little sun in the hands of the bishop had lost its bright brilliance. He hung it on his chest and turned to walk inside the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the square, the pretty black robe witch has been burned to ashes, but the crazy laughter and curse seem to be reverberating, so many people endure I stopped looking at it, looked around, then followed the bishops and pastors into the church, repented of my crimes under the Lord’s attention, and prayed earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye-catching white light seems to be still in front of you, and its sacred and majestic power seems to be able to feel vaguely. Lucien is already under this impact. I accepted my identity and buried everything in the past deeply, not to show the slightest difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of magic is so powerful, I wonder if I have the opportunity to learn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean thought with a shocked mind that there was no awe of ordinary people. Suddenly, a huge force was shot on the left shoulder of Lucien, and he could not help but fall to the left and almost stood unsteadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my poor little Evans, you are finally fine, this is the Lord’s blessing, I thought you would be as sick as your father. I never got up again, thank the Lord, so that such a good guy can continue to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was so beaten, already shocked Waking up in disappointment, I saw a pair of two big brown hairs standing on the side, wiping tears, and patted their shoulders with the right hand that could attack the bear paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly flashing away, lest he was beaten to vomit blood, Lucien opened his mouth, but found a word can not say, because: "This big man should What do you call it? It seems that my full name should be Lucien Evans?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s hiding makes the big man more sad: “Poor The little Evans, you must be confused, you can see the little face, you can see the bones thin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucy Enthusiastic, self-traveling, in addition to being able to understand, can speak the language here, what memory does not inherit, if you respond to mistakes, it is likely to be misunderstood as a devil possession, of course, in a sense, Now Lucien is indeed encroached on the soul by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, a middle-aged man standing next to him patted the fat man and said, "Alice, little Evans is just right." The spirit must be weak, don't quarrel with him. Ai Wen, support your mother, let us go home together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man is very thin, The back was slightly bowed, and there was a short blond hair with a slight white color. The face of the vicissitudes of time was faintly visible to see the handsome young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Lucien, this middle-aged uncle is like an angel with a white ring, separating himself from jealousy and tension. angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alice is screaming, I am all right, just a little dizzy." Lucien raised words to avoid being exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy who took Lucian to see the burning witch, Ai Wen half-guarded his mother, dressed up with a grimace: "Luo Xi'an is not that kind of The coward who died when he was sick once, only you still need him to take care of the little things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice screamed with tears: "Little Evans, When I saw you, I was relieved, and I blamed the damn, evil witch who had gone to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was supported by Ai Wen, Ai Lisa dad slowly walked forward and said: "When she just moved to the house next to you, how quiet and beautiful, how gentle, I still think that if John can marry such a girl, That is the gift of the Lord, but she turned out to be a witch, and she ran to the cemetery to steal the will of the deceased to display evil magic. Fortunately, the glory of the Lord shines through everything. At that time, the night watchman of the referee was in the cemetery and will be her. Grab it directly, or else she will be ready for evil magic, we Ade let the district do not know how many people to die... & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Seeing that Lucien didn't talk, the middle-aged uncle took a picture of Lucien's shoulder and whispered comfort: "Alice is like this, you just don't hear it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not know what to say, only nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged uncle looked at the back of Eliza’s big man and sighed quietly: “Hey, Alisa was a pure and passionate girl. But since I was born with a little John, it was like being cursed by the devil. In just one year, it has become what it is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a pair It seems to be full of emotions, and his eyes are quite deep, and then paused: "I can't beat her anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just crossed over and saw it with my own eyes And with the power of the magical power, Lucien was greatly shocked and was in a state of restlessness, so he just smiled and did not answer directly, and he did not know what the uncle should call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the uncle recalled too much, and did not notice the control of the sound, Eliza snorted: "Joel, you are full of ideals and passions The bard, the young man who has worked hard to find Alto to pursue his musical dreams, has not become a drunken drunkard all day long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel He smiled and laughed: "Aalto is the city of the Holy Ghost. I don't know how many young people who are looking for music dreams come every day. But how many of them can be successful? Eliza, let's say that since Little John started exercising, I don't Did you stop drinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice squinted and glanced at him: "Fortunately, there is the Lord's blessing, and you know that our hopes are all in John and Ai. If it weren't for John to exercise every day, how could he be picked by Sir Wien and go to his manor for regular knight training. If he could stimulate the 'God' in the blood and become a real knight, then he could be The Grand Seal is the Lord and becomes a distinguished noble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Severe gaze let Joel shrink his shoulders, but Alice quickly noticed the side of Lucien’s embarrassment: "Oh, sorry, little Evans, I didn’t mean to mention this thing, you too Very talented, just, just didn't start exercising from a young age..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding that the more you say the more it hurts the wounds of Lucien, Eliza is busy I closed my mouth and gestured to Joel with my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel laughed and patted Lucien’s shoulder again: “How could our little Evans be so vulnerable, but he wants to inherit his Joel The uncle musician dreams of a man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent Lucian had to grin and smile: "Yes, my dream is to become a musician." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is nothing wrong with Lucien, Eliza continues to carry on all sorts of trivial matters, but instead gives Lucien a further look at the city where he lives. To understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big city called Aalto. Near the dark mountains, there is the title of the city of holiness, prosperity, full of opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where I currently live is the Adejan district where Aalto’s poor people gather, and I seem to have lost the help in the market area because of a serious illness for a few days. Fixed work of goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the four went to the hut where Lucien was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alissa had wanted to invite Lucian to go to her house for dinner, but Lucian, who was in desperate need of quiet, euphemistically refused her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When separated, Aiwen quietly and curiously asked Lucien: "Butn, Big Brother, when did your dream become a musician?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just now." Lucien numbly moved his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Wen snorted long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, the door is locked, Lucien is sitting down, the elbows are on the wooden table, and the head is deeply buried in the elbow . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have actually crossed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this is a world with inhuman power ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
