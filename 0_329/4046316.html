			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first impression that the Dark Mountain left for Lucien was a word "huge", the mountain was huge, the trees were huge, the vines were huge, and the beasts were huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering giants of hundreds of meters high are everywhere, and it seems to have been covered with a layer of black leaves to hide in the dark mountains. People are like being in the evening, and it is rare to have bright light coming in directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick layer under the foot is all piled up with decaying leaves, stepping on the soft loach, you can't tell where the solid land is, and where is the danger. The swamps, if they are not careful, will fall into it, unable to extricate themselves, and they can suddenly smash dangerous and disgusting creatures such as snakes and spiders from the soil, the trees, the decaying leaves and the shrubs anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the various rotten atmospheres are often mixed into a colorful, colorful and toxic mist, even the official knight does not dare to touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in such a harsh environment, Lucien is dressed in a white shirt, black double-breasted long dress, and a monocle, as if walking in a safe Alin In cities such as Er, Rantart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Elvis, how long does it take to reach the magic tower of Lord of the Nightmare?" Cautious, the heart of the road, observes the tall trees around. The tangled vines, the fascinating flowers that smelled astringency, and asked the liaisons next to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Elvis is a plain-looking brown-haired ordinary person who usually buys items in the adventurer’s camp and then sells it to In the depths of the dark mountains, those magicians who are inconvenient to approach the fortress in the Dark Mountain Range, because he represents the interests of many similar magicians, no one dares to provoke him in the adventurer camps where there are many powerful and fierce madmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After accepting the task, Lucien, who got the information from the Magic Council, knew that he was not as simple as it was, and there was a vaguely king of nightmare, Stanis The figure bears the task of helping the king of the nightmare to inquire about the outside world and guide the visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, upon arrival at the Adventurer’s Camp, Lucien re-transferred the complex minds back to the dangers of the Dark Mountains and the completion of the mission, straightforward to find El Weiss, with vague words, showed his intentions and did not unexpectedly get his response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis in a black tight-fitting suit is brisk, the whole person is like a cheetah with restrained strength and ready to go, hearing the problem of Lucien After that, I didn't look back, and I continued to watch for four weeks. I answered in a plain tone: "At least half a month or more. Mr. X, you should be clear that there is no legendary level in the dark mountains. It is best not to fly, but go too fast. It is also too easy to react to some terrorist creatures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. X is the codename that Lucien told Elvis, not using his real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently grasped the jaw, agreeing that the high mountains of the dark mountains are said to be covered with cracks, connecting the dangerous different space, so here There are strange creatures and a wide variety of creatures, and many powerful magical creatures like to divide their own territory. If they are not strong enough to fly over their territory, they are very vulnerable to attack. The most typical example is the dragon. Not to mention a lot of flying creatures hovering in the air, such as lightning hawks, griffins, scavengers and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pile of soft, decaying leaves, a blue-yellow viper suddenly picked up and bitten on Lucien’s lap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, this snake is like a bite in a stone that almost breaks its teeth, a strip of body bounces, rushes away , hid in the decaying foliage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From entering the Dark Mountains, Lucien carefully added two defensive spells of "stone skin" and "Douglas's spell absorbing wall". It is not to be taken care of here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't feel it beforehand?" Lucien is both natural and self-talking, as if he is asking Elvis, with his four-ring magician. The mental power sensor, actually did not find a snake at his feet. Even if the surrounding rotten atmosphere is very repressive, it should not be suppressed to such an extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis frowned slightly: "My intuition seems to have been suppressed. Is there any high-level magical creature nearby?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After identifying the environment, Elvis slightly deviated from the original direction and then continued on. Anyway, there was no real road in the dark mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps in the darkness, Lucien Hurricane heard the strange noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge spider slammed down from the sky, and the back of the ridge was colorful, seemingly a strange smiling face, protruding fangs like a dark dagger The lower part is flat with two black arms wrapped in a carapace. The twelve fingers have a hundred and twenty curved joints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spider fell, the white, thick spider silk squirted into a giant net, covering the road to Lucion and Elvis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s wrist flashed, and the red fireball emerged out of thin air, hitting the spider web straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent explosion occurred, and the ignited flame quickly ignited the spider silk and spread quickly, quickly turning the spider web into a fire net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakness of spider silk is the flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician, if the most basic monster knowledge is not clear, then it is not qualified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge spider just moved agilely as soon as it landed, and the joints again made a squeaking sound, no more slow than the big three-level knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the noisy surrounding is like a noise, a huge colorful spider or flying down or hanging down. Spider silk swayed to the ground, surrounded by Lucien and Elvis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deformation Spider", a spider unique to the Dark Mountain Range, can change the monsters of the body of the sage, and has three levels of strength and speed in adulthood. Agile high, good at using supernatural forces such as illusion, like group activities, collective hunting, often can deal with enemies much stronger than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge of this dark creature passed through the mind, followed by Lucien’s "group panic", invisible magical fluctuations spreading around . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this magical wave touched Elvis, his chest talisman bloomed with a white glow, offsetting “group panic”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those deformed spiders were mostly scared to go around, a small number of successful defenses, and attacked Lucien from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have some quiet green ripples on their bodies, as if they are calming the flow of sleep, and some continue to spray spider webs, trying to trap Lu Xien People, some of them rushed to the past, ready to successfully trap, then started a close fight, beat the opponent with a bite, inject venom and cuddle, and wrap them into spider mites as a reserve food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elvis looked at Lucian with a dissatisfied look, then carried a skull-sized black giant hammer against the deformed spider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he understands that Mr. X is going to control the scene with indistinguish range magic, it is a better choice in the previous situation, anyway for Mr. X. It’s not practical to have such a helper, and it’s horrifying to recover. But when the scope-type magic affects itself, it’s inevitable that he’s still a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hammer can ignite the burning flame, destroying the spider web, etc., and hammering a deformed spider between the four and five The patties, while the monster's sleep, vertigo, and silent phantoms are all offset by the talisman that he has not yet disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like a four-level knight, and has yet to show his blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s body highlights a layer of transparent light with numerous magical symbols, absorbing the quiet green ripples, the frightening black phantom, etc. Use the Coral Staff to assist in locking, and inspire the Fireball's "Fireball" to kill a deformed spider in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spelling buffer, Lucien’s staff pointed out that those who did not have close combat but chose to cast spell power, spray spider web deformation spiders, and The head of the frightened compatriots condensed a dark cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
