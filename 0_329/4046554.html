			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ruth, who knows something about Salter, is holding a newspaper and speculating on Sarde’s intention: "This is a form of learning through theology, The sublimation of the priests and the night watchmen of the Holm parish will be sublimated and cultivated. The personnel exchange should also be the purpose, and the nails can be buried in other parishes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Think of Vera again? Amorton has already begun to take charge of the referee of Holm Parish. Lucien is quite admired for Sarder. It is only a radical vigil who privately executed an enlightened aristocrat, and he was used to this extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be Sarde's standing behind the night watchmen... But what does he want to do, is it a split church after the situation?" Whether it is the new church that he splits or the church in the south, it will inevitably fall from the position of the world's first place. It can no longer be as beautiful as it is now, and even its own sphere of influence will be adopted by the parliament, the northern church, the elf king court, etc. Encroachment, is Sarder not so stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, if he is behind the Lord of Hell and the goal is to weaken the church, then there is nothing wrong with it. A person like him will never fall from a Holy Spirit into a servant of the devil unless he has completely collapsed his intellectual interests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De wants to use the five major parishes as a springboard. After the call of Pope Benedict II, the Lord is on the top?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope Benedict II has been crowned for almost 30 years. According to the law of the past, he will rise to the same level as the pope for more than 20 years. Paradise Hill, Sald, who has a long life span, can wait for it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phenomenon of short-lived pope on the position of the Pope has long been noticed by the Magic Council Yes, but there has been no reasonable explanation. The initial suspicion is that too close to the "God of Truth", often borrowing the power of "He", so the body and soul can not bear, and is quickly assimilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and turned the newspaper around casually, thinking: "I hope Natasha can test Sarder to have some results if he hopes Splitting the church, the members of the highest parliamentary assembly of the Magic Council must be endorsed by both hands and feet, even if he is behind the 'Lord of the Hell' and he is not worried. The most fear is that he is ambitious, provokes the war between the church and the parliament, and cleans the five majors through war. The rebel factions within the parish set up a prestige that others could not contend with, and finally took the secret of the Necromancer to the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is very likely to break through the short-lived restrictions of the popes of the past, which is a bad news for any party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thinking, Lucien goes to Hall Go to the top of the Royal Magic Tower and return to Allinge by the “Elemental Paradise”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the gap of "Second Battle", Natasha reminded Lu Xien that the Pope’s internal attention to him not only did not follow the new space Finding and lowering, but paying more attention, because this is the stage where Lucian is likely to relax, a quasi-big arcian, the legendary peak of the future, must be killed in the cradle, so she let Lucien try not to To meet her too often, she will also restrain her emotions, and it is best to choose a half-plane jump when going back and forth to Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the hallway, Lucien met with many elements of the will, so his face always smiled and greeted them, but their expressions appeared A little weird, let Lucien pinch his face in a puzzled way, and he took out a hot bath before he came out. There should be no residual love on his body. Is there any problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"K, why are you also this expression?" When Lucien met a tall and honest K, he found that he was also a strange face, and finally could not help Asked the opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K's teacher Larry accepts the forced task to go out. During this time he has been studying the power of "new alchemy" and has accumulated a lot of questions to be with Lucy. En exchange, at this time he resisted and smiled, scratching his head: "Lu Xien, you just finished the wedding, his face has been smirking, his body has a strange satisfaction and comfort, walking is also a bit Gone with the wind, people with experience can see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of the words he did not say much, but self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quite touched his forehead and his own spring breeze was so obvious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then quickly converge on the smile and try to make myself look less happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herther Hathaway..." Lucien just rolled out the sheets with her younger generation and tasted each other several times. I saw that Hathaway had a feeling of seeing her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri’s beautiful face has no expression, very serious: “She is a girl who is very serious about feelings, I hope you don’t want to be like Oliver.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Arcanist Lord Oliver has always been used as a negative textbook by the intellectual ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about my emotional life in recent years, you should know something about Hathaway. One heart and one mind is the most gentle and powerful force in the world. Regardless of whether it is arcane and magic research, or emotional life, I hold this attitude. "In the face of "Mother Mother", Lucien is naturally sincere and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei was silent for a moment, nodded slowly, and her face seemed to be a little bit uncomfortable because of Natasha and Lucien. I am pleased: "I have seen your performance in my eyes. If not, I will definitely stop it. If there is a violation in the future, we are the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke concisely, almost nothing to modify the words of the surname, and it seems that the subtle words are not satisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly wiped the cold sweat, but fortunately he has always been more serious, except for occasional fantasies, even if no one will follow the principle, or else In front of this "mother-in-law", "the mother-in-law" is really difficult to pass: "Whether poor or rich, whether low or noble, regardless of suffering or enjoyment, young or aging, I will love her, respect her, comfort her, accompany her. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pressure of "Mother Mother", Lucien himself had a little difficulty in organizing his own words, simply by modifying the Christian marriage vows on Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri is not asking, but gently swearing: "I can do it when I say it, this is a qualified man, I am a bit The problem of the new alchemy is discussed with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, finally passed, Lucine’s heart sighed and discussed the arcane problem comparable. The topic is much more relaxed, especially with a majestic "Mother." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Lucien and Hathaway ended the discussion and returned to Allinge, ready to go to the council to find a copy of the soup. Information about the priests of the Holm parish, which details in more detail what may be radicals, which may be retro, and which are the appeasements that may be peaceful with the Magic Council, which can be recommended to Natasha Contact and temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the starting step for the development of the Sage State, and the action plan refers to the British Reformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very appreciative of the decree issued by Henry VIII: "All words, words, actions, kings, heretics, clerk, tyrant, etc. Those who deny the legitimate marriage of the king are rebellious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just leaving the magic tower of the will of the element, Lucien’s monocle changed There was little burning, so the magic array was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, where did you go? Come over, Oliver has a problem and wants to discuss with you." The sound of the storm dominated the big door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly explained: "I have discussed the new alchemy with Mr. Hathaway for a morning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zizz, Fernando, who had an urgent surname, had already interrupted the electromagnetic communication. He recently cracked the "fission" and "fusion" and made his temper very violent. How can I listen to Lu Xien? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the monocle, Lucien picks up an eyebrow, the teacher has already let Lord Oliver accept it? The efficiency is quite high...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge Magic Tower III On the thirteenth floor, Lucien stepped into the study of teacher Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is writing and drawing on paper. When he sees Lucien coming in, he suddenly stops, and then smiles and smiles: "Today is your life." Hey, did the date 'Queen' go last night? And it seems to have been 'taste' by the 'Queen'?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon seeing Lucien's expression, Fernando immediately laughed in a hurry: "There is no experience, it was swindled by me, but you can see it with Natasha, you can guess without prophecy." Get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Lucien asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled and said: "After a long distance, I will smell the 'taste' of your estrus. How do you feel that life has entered a new stage? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really shocked me. I thought you would drag on for several years before it progressed. How many days? I doubt if you are mine. Student Lu Xien, did you finally decide to get rid of it after the last time I was stimulated?” Fernando “sneered at” Lucien. “But, this way, I am relieved, Natasha is completely down to the parliament. Now, we will try to help you push the position of Prince Nexus, which marks that the parliament has the upper hand in Holm, but it takes time, don't worry. Lucine, you are a rare shining gem. I can study arcane and use the beauty meter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing makes Fernando feel good, the more it is outrageous, but he does not seem to The parliament has made progress to Holm's encroachment again, but is delighted that Lucien has finally made a breakthrough in his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Prince Nexus is the queen’s husband’s title, from the title of the prince who built the Necker Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, Lord Oliver?" Lucian quickly shifted the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning the arcane problem, Fernando was serious, with a half-face into his own, met Oliver with a white hair set, had to say He is indeed a handsome middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, Fernando showed me your paper. It was really unacceptable at first. I think that time and space is absurd, but after I think carefully, I found that this view sprouted in my heart, which hindered the shackles of past experience and common sense, and did not dare to go forward boldly." Oliver said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is a little relieved, this does not seem to recognize the world's broken and solidified: "You can accept the Lord Oliver, I will be relieved." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, when studying electromagnetic theory, I and many magicians of the electromagnetic system tried to combine the theory of the Speaker and the theory of Brugge to build a A unified arcane system that can be used in all aspects. After all, the origin of any thing should have a common essence. This essence can be called magic. It can be called arcane or real, but it will definitely not be Two different systems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver said his ideals, finding a system that explains everything is common to any magician who is interested in the road of arcane. The wish, the "great unity" of truth is the beginning of the magic empire, "they" have not changed for thousands of years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the process of integration, we have found a lot of problems and contradictions, which have been unable to be effectively solved due to 'can't let go of the common sense of the past'. Based on these experiences, I have a similar point of view, so it is easier to accept your thesis. I believe that many electromagnetic and light arcane divisions are also the same. Of course, unacceptable ones must occupy the majority." Oliver probably Explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded lightly, and it was expected that this "relative time and space view" would be in a position where everyone attacked, not thinking of what he was not familiar with. The magicians of the electromagnetic, light and dark factions have already had a good thought on this issue. This kind of subversion of the idea of ​​the surname, Oliver and others certainly will not be published directly in the paper, but carefully discussed in private. I am prepared to have a shaped idea and strong evidence to submit, so Lucien does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver turned his head: "But your thesis has a lot of questions, and today I want to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy." Lucien walked to the sofa next to Oliver and Fernando was ready to join the discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took out the paper and wrote: "It’s about relative surnames and slowing down time. For example, we can imagine a simplified experiment with two equal ages. The twins, in which the brother flies toward the depths of the sky at a speed very close to the speed of light, the younger brother is standing still, and when the brother arrives at a planet that takes 15 years to light, he immediately returns, then he meets with his brother. Who will be younger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
