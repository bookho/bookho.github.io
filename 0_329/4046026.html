			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is very satisfied, Lucien is learning as fast as in the past few days, less than fifty minutes, completely remembering the rest of the grammar rules It seems that in addition to being very clever and having language talent, his memory is equally amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mood was good, Victor immediately got the inspiration, set off a small melody, then clap his hands and gently smiled: "Gentlemen, ladies, After studying for so long, you must be very tired. It is better to have a cup of afternoon tea, eat some fruit, and relax your spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he went upstairs Go, record this melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an elegant and beautiful pale glazed porcelain cup, Lucien gently took a sip of black tea and found that he had sadly adapted to this quirky taste, and I licked my temples and relaxed my head for a few days of intense learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fillis, when are you invited to go to your home to hunt? I miss the charming fresh taste, and the bunny and deer, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aristocratic girl, Annie, suddenly smiled. She has beautiful long blond hair and emerald-like eyes, but the facial features are not good, very ordinary. Moreover, her family status is not good. My father is only the most inconspicuous of the many Baron's children. Not only is it impossible to inherit the title and territory, but it seems that even the manor and the real estate cannot inherit one place. The income of the court clerk and the baron’s pension are barely decent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, as a member of the Hain family of several major families in the Vaurit, the father of Felice, although ultimately failed to inherit the Earl of the Earl And the hereditary territory, but the old count left him a large manor outside the city of Aalto, with forests, fruit trees, grape fields, and even rocky stone fields, and a property in the city of Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the family of Felice is the best among all the nobles present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hot summer, you can go to the manor in the suburbs to hunt and enjoy the summer, enjoy the delicious wine brewed by your own home, including Lott, the small family has no estate. The most enviable things for ordinary aristocratic teenagers and girls, so Anne faintly appealed to Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? Miss Felice, your home estate has cute rabbits and beautiful deer?" A look of curiosity and yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucian came to study on the first day, Renee tried to use music to approach the noble students such as Felice, Lot, Anne, etc. Not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by her, I don’t know where to inquire about a little music theory in the past few days, and then ask Felice or Annie with advice and doubts. I finally got acquainted with them and was able to join the circle of their communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her example, Colin and David, two civilian teenagers, also looked for topics from this aspect, close to the aristocratic students, the effect is equally obvious, only the road Sean, who concentrates on learning, doesn't even say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Lucien is not approaching, no matter whether it is a noble student such as Lott or Felice, or a civilian student such as Renee and Colin, He lowered his identity and talked with him, still maintaining a cold and icy attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis maintains a dignified sitting posture, and smiles with a standard and polite response: "I also miss those cute animals, but Victor's symphony will still For more than three months, during this time, every weekend, I and Lot and Herodotus have to come here or the Musicians Association to help Victor's teacher rehearse the music and practice their own instruments. There is really no time to go. Hunting in the suburbs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anne’s kindness, Renee’s longing, envy and flattery, Felice is very satisfied and happy, who doesn’t like it. a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Lucien listened to their conversations, of course, they also have a certain yearning, and they want to have their own estate, but the most important thing is, etc. How to borrow a dictionary of common words from Mr. Victor and how to turn over a thick dictionary into the soul library in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exchanges of Felice, Lott, Anne, Colin, Renee, etc., or in a deliberate exchange, Victor walked down and his mouth was vague I can still see a faint smile, and I am obviously satisfied with the melody just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I forgot, damn, and indulged in the music in the morning." Victor squinted his right hand and looked a little annoyed. "Come and ask them to come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the esteem and graceful movement of Ace, Victor turned his head to look at Lucien and others, and spread his hands. Sorry, "Sorry, dear gentlemen, ladies, I forgot today. I have made an appointment with you, and the rest of your homework will be filled at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is so polite, Lott, Felice, Anne and Lucien is not at all inhuman, but Lucien decided that when Mr. Victor was apologetic, he borrowed a lexicary dictionary directly from him for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Lucien wanted to speak, Ace had brought the guests in. One was a handsome silver-haired man in a red shirt and black jacket. One is a white-haired old man with a wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein..." At the same time, Lucien and Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis had a faint blush on his face, and Lucien was completely surprised. He didn’t expect it to be a bard, but became a musician. Mr. Victor is very valued by the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Felice, hey, Lucien." Rhein smiled and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice smiled shyly, then woke up, and Lott and others, surprised to see Lucien, he and Mr. Rhine know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, do you know Mr. Rhein?" Victor asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded. "I have seen Mr. Rhein once. I didn't expect to meet Mr. Rhein again in your home in Mr. Victor."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine smile reveals a bit of charm, and said: "Although I have only seen it once, but Lu Xien gave me a deep impression, huh, you really have to start learning the text, Well, I admire the young people who have the ambition and dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that Rhine seems to be eating and drinking, Lucien is so appreciated, Lived a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor introduced a smile: "Mr. Rhein is the chief of the symphony orchestra who works with me. He has an unusual understanding of music. With his communication, I can write a satisfactory piano concerto with inspiration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, he even mixed the band's chief?!" Lucy The grace was stunned, and a few days ago, the Rhine lived in the slum-style brass tavern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, from the conversations between Felice and Lott, Lucien learned the world symphony against several books in the library. The composition of the regiment is roughly the same as that on the earth. It has also learned a lot of knowledge. It understands the position of the chief in the symphony orchestra. It is the first violinist. When there is no conductor, he has to be responsible for command and coordination. How important is this position? To a stranger who has just come to Aalto and has never had a match with the band? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have seen the surprise of Lucien, Rhein humorously smiled: "Because the previous band chief liked a noble lady, a few days ago Elope with her to the ancient kingdom of Syrah, no way, I have to make a reluctance to replace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis could not bear the words: "Even the former chief Mr. Rhein is still strong enough to be the first violinist. With the band, just practice a few times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Rhein is one of the best violinists I have ever seen, and has his own unique insights into the music.” Victor also praised, “Meeting him is the biggest gain of my time.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the smiling, seemingly unpredictable Rhine, and still felt very weird in his heart, it seems too coincidental, a wandering from the ancient kingdom of Syria The bard with the harp, within a few days, became the first violin of a symphony orchestra. Playing at home, it is hard to believe, reveals a strange inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine right hand pressed his left chest, slightly sighed, thanked Victor's praise, and then introduced the white-haired old gentleman next to him: "This is Mr. Xavier, Aalto. One of the best harpsichord makers should be able to help Mr. Victor complete the modification of the harpsichord. The harpsichord is also called the plucked piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
