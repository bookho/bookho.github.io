			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study room of Babel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien closed his eyes and rested on the back of the chair, with a cup of boiled water in front of him, but in fact, he was watching the soul library. The information about quantum mechanics absorbs and learns this knowledge hunger and thirst, especially about the mechanics of matrix, from time to time in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for the current Lucien, the content of matrix mechanics is hard and hard, and it takes a lot of thought to learn. It is like A huge but cold monster is full of unfriendly or even ferocious atmosphere for any beginner. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne can follow the route of De Broglie, and put forward the Schrödinger wave equation, which is better at using the electromagnetic system and the light and dark system. The surgeon is more familiar with the more accustomed form of the wave dynamics, which is also a branch of quantum mechanics, and can solve most of the current questions about new alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is from the perspective of electrons is a wave-like wave, an extension of the theory of volatility, and oneself is regarded as one of the main representatives of particle theory, if suddenly abandoned The good-natured arcane masters turned to the embrace of volatility and presented tangible evidence, which is likely to blow up their friends, companions and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Lucien prefers to learn matrix mechanics based on particle surnames and discontinuous surnames, using it to solve the problem of the new alchemy model, in particle theory Supporters will no longer easily shake the belief in the new alchemy and particles, and then slowly throw out the monsters of De Broglie and electron diffraction experiments, and truly establish the wave-particle two-image surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Matrix mechanics, wave dynamics... This seems to be another battlefield for particle theory and wave theory, although they are mathematically equivalent, a Different expressions of theory..." Lucine said in a silent voice, "Matrix, is a vocabulary full of fashion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is this Think of the Matrix. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After closing the books on quantum mechanics in the Soul Library, Lucien breathed a sigh of relief and perfected the new mathematical concept of matrix on the draft paper. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although nearly half a year is enough for Lucien to master the original matrix mechanics, he did not try to derive conclusions and conduct experiments, intending to wait for the soul of the first entry. After stabilizing, I did not get real-world feedback, and half of his energy has been built on the legendary spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, "time and space scepter" is relatively simple. After the restoration of Lucien's soul, it was completed in less than two weeks. "Revenge gaze" benefited from Lucien used the knowledge of lasers in the Soul Library to analyze and simplify it, and it was almost at the final stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of refreshing scent is introduced to the nose of Lucien, indicating that Natasha has left because of the formal wedding and planning of Ketonia For the sake of this, the two did not live together, but Natasha often came to Allinge for a few days, and Lucien occasionally went to Nekse Palace to visit the Grand Duke of Ouolite and stay overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men’s exchanges are made through Hathaway’s half-plane, and they do not give any chance to Ketonia and others, but From time to time, I went to the "land of thousands of lakes" for a holiday, as if I didn't care about danger at all, and there were really no dangerous things happening on these holidays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulge in a deep breath, Lucien is cautious about the wedding after a few months, if Ketonia and others do not grasp this "opportunity" Attack, there is no need to consume with them, directly show the strength of the legendary shock, kill the danger in the cradle, can not live because of the trap to kill them for a long time to live a very careful life, it is better to move in In the half-plane, the safety factor will be greatly improved. At that time, two of the time and space nodes of the "Atomic Universe" will be set in the Nexel Palace and the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking back, Lu Xien put down the quill, ready to continue the "revenge gaze" analysis work, and strive to complete it as soon as possible, this time, the door rang Awkward knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without mental field induction, Lucien knows Leo through the control of the magic tower, and he has a letter standing outside the room:" Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, is the letter of Mr. Ravendi." Leo language succinctly said, understand that the Lord is the most taboo when studying arcane and magic. Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Leo closed the door to the study, Lucien picked up the letter, and the projection of the fateful star made him have a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the letter was shaken off, Lucien’s sight was solidified on the first sight. This bold assumption is very similar to De Broglie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one will release this horrible monster in advance?" Lucien laughed and laughed at himself. This is not a game, not everyone. They all follow the progress they expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the monster has already found his head, Lucien is no longer entangled in the question of why it will appear in advance, but read it carefully and thinks How to minimize the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...from the perspective of electronic fluctuations, it can be regarded as a standing wave on the orbit, so that the fixed orbit can only be wavelength Integer multiples, which naturally lead to quantization..." Lucien thought as he frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Lucien put the letter paper back on the table and sighed softly: "The world also has a bold mind, a whimsical arcane master, still Well, he has not completed the electron diffraction experiment, otherwise he can only use the privilege of the Arcanist, let his papers be submitted, step by step, so as not to explode too many heads."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a thing suddenly throws out, other factions Lucian can't judge anything, at least one-third of the high-level arcanes in the elemental and alchemy fields will not be able to withstand such an impact. Either bursting his head or knowing that the world is broken and solidified, and most of the rest will be confused for a long time. After all, all previous phenomena and experimental results have undoubtedly confirmed that electrons are particles, and found it from themselves. At the beginning, no one doubts this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now there is no need to let this paper be postponed, anyway, there is no experimental evidence, first play my authoritative surname, let the arcane masters face this problem, etc. They have a comprehensive attention and in-depth thinking, and they have prepared in the heart, and then throw out an electron diffraction experiment." Lucien quickly decided to write his own opinion in the letter sent by Lavendi: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whimsical assumption..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter's sunset falls below the horizon very early, not until dinner time, everywhere is dim, Dieppe is anxiously squatting back and forth in the room of the Ravendi Magic Tower Steps, thoughts rolling in my mind, all kinds of weird thoughts come and go, they are even the opposite:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Evans confirmed me The paper, does that mean that electrons are really waves? This is incredible, and there is no phenomenon and experimental confirmation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So from the bold assumptions, Dieppe himself has a certain degree of suspicion about the thesis. If Lucien gives unequivocal approval, he will hesitate and dare not accept it. The electron is a wave, which is in the head of anyone. It’s a ridiculous thing, even if it’s his own assumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Lord Evans also euphemistically gives a negative opinion like Lord Morris, then maybe my paper is really wrong."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the world will return to normal, and Dieppe feels relieved, but his heart is faintly unwilling, which broke out when the new alchemy was at the bottleneck. Bold thinking, this ridiculous paper that solves some problems to some extent, is the crystallization of his own efforts, the spark of his own wisdom in an instant, if it is denied by everyone, it is really unacceptable:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, even if Ivans objected, as long as he did not point out the obvious mistakes, I would use the experimental results to verify, and can not easily give up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this extremely contradictory inner struggle, Dieppe is more and more anxious, and he hopes that the idea that Lucien recognizes gradually gains the upper hand, and the self-encouragement that is not easily abandoned is even more raging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How have you not responded yet?" Dieppe once again looked out the window. He has done hundreds of such moves since the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I understand that Evans is very busy, there are things to do with magical learning and arcane research, and I don’t necessarily read the letter in time, but he can’t help it. Look forward to and hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
