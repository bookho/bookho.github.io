			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Chris’s pleading, Lucien’s smiling expression is unchanged, the language is warm and authentic: “If your message is valuable, I will consider it as appropriate. The right is in my hands, you can choose to say or not to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris is scared and scared, but the tears are more and more The begging for mercy, at this time did not dare to hesitate and protest, hurriedly said: "Knight, I stole an invitation letter a few days ago, maybe you will be interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a good thief, Lucy’s long sword began in the throat, Chris did not give up the effort to find a chance to escape, but thought of the opposite is a real knight who inspired the blood. He wouldn't dare to act rashly. His proud agility and speed were ridiculously ridiculous in front of the Cavaliers. Unless he even hoped for mercy, he would risk his last fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invitation?" Lucien was slightly confused. "Why do you think I will be interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Chris sees Lucien and doesn't do it. He gradually restrains fear and fear. He clearly states: "Because it looks like an invitation to a low-level black magician gathering, it will be the knight you. A good opportunity to leave a legend of heroes!" He remembered a lot of rumors, using Lucien as the knight who followed the ancient training and cruised the mainland after the promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Low-order Black Wizard? What is the invitation? Why didn't you directly report the church? I think that will give you a generous reward. "Lu Xien heard that it was a magician, and suddenly there was no small interest or doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the close watch of Lucien’s gaze, Chris took a neat piece of paper from his belt and passed it over: “Premier Knight, this is an invitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a mysterious traveler in Longya Town a few days ago. Because of his wide shots, I quietly followed him. Leaving, I was looking for a chance to steal something. As a result, he did not walk the avenue, but walked through the surrounding forest. I just saw him killing several beasts who tried to attack him with evil black magic."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left the paper with his left hand, and his eyes were recorded in the soul library:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When the silver moon rises on the second Friday of July, a death feast will be held at the Kareldia Castle to welcome a gentleman from the mainland Magic Council headquarters. The original Wilfrid territory Magicians, magic apprentices, this will be the beginning of your bright future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No name No signature, this is a strange banquet, but Lucien is still full of interest, because it seems to be able to reach the magician sent by the mainland Magic Council headquarters, so that they don’t have to suffer after they arrive at the sea pearl Sturk. Looking for a contact person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris sees Lucien’s expression without any change, continuing his own remark: “There was another adventurer squad that followed the mysterious traveler. After seeing the evil black magic, they thought that they were sure to kill the traveler, so they kept the beast consuming the other's magic, and then began to raid and encircle. Unfortunately, they underestimated the horrible black magic that can evoke the deceased, but instead Travelers have the upper hand. But when they fight for both losses, they are found by the nearby robbers and killed together. I seized the opportunity and stole the valuable items on the traveler’s body, which included this. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of robbers are so lucky..." Lucien felt the pity of the magic apprentice, then asked Chris again: "Why You didn't report the church? Do you know Kareldiya Castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Wilfrid territory, Lucien is no stranger because Ancient literature and historical records can be clearly , Wilfrid is one of several central and southern mainland rule legendary Necromancer ancient magic Empire, but he fallen under siege in the Church Cardinal, even demiplane magic towers were destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a thief who walks in the darkness and shadows. If it is known to the church, it will definitely be on the gallows, so..." Chris’s own thief I am very proud of my identity. "I'm sorry, respected knight, I don't know where Kareldia Castle is. In fact, I have inquired about the Kosher City Adventurer's Guild and the Thieves' Union. No one knows. The location of this castle, even they have never heard of this castle. I think it is probably a code inside the Dark Wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien’s heart passed the disappointment, and no one knew Kareldia Castle. He seemed to miss this opportunity, and he was unfamiliar in Djibouti’s Principality. It was difficult to find clues. However, Lucien still has a gentle and calm smile on his face: "I am very satisfied with this news. Right, Chris, haven't you told anyone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Knight is your pleasure to be satisfied." Chris sighed quietly and seemed to be able to keep his hands. Then he smiled happily. "This news, I have not found a buyer, if the Cavaliers you command, I will keep it in my heart, so that you can complete the heroic epic yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "doing well." Then the sword One sent, coldly plunged into Chris's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris cleverly glared at Lucien, his throat squeaking, and he thought as if he was shouting: "How could things become like this?" Why do you want to kill me?! Are you not a knight who obeys the creed?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retracted his sword and said softly: "You know too. More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the possibility of finding the castle of Karentaldia is very small, if you really have the opportunity to go, then you know the invitation. Chris is the source of danger, because it is not clear when he will sell the news, which will attract the attention of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it is not his own friend or innocent, Lucien is becoming more and more guilty about killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze gradually lost its brilliance, and Chris fell on the car's wooden board without knowing it. If you knew it would be like this, you might as well choose to leave your left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes begging for mercy and exchange is not necessarily a better choice than directly penalizing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finger flames emerged, the invitation was burned, Lucien pushed the window of the car and shouted: "Betty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigil of the half-elf girl Betty, in addition to occasionally yawning, has been observing the surroundings in accordance with the method taught by her brother Simon, to guard against the sneak attack of beasts or robbers, but behind the road The call was to scare her, and the stick that moved the campfire almost fell into the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakening is the voice of the employer, not the kind of grievances and ghosts in the legend of the witch and the black magician. Betty just patted the chest and complained. : "It’s scaring me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and squeezed a sweet smile: "Mr. Evans, is there anything?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come to the carriage here, something is telling you." Lucien sounded a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty took a two-step subconscious mind and suddenly remembered what my sister and brother-in-law had mentioned, a lot of looks and good-looking female surnames, adventurers and mercenaries. It was harassed and tempted by the employer, but now the night is quiet, Mr. Evans calls himself to his carriage... So she slams and her face smiles stiffly: "Mr. Evans, what should you say directly?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although if the employer is generous and there is no place that people are too annoying, some female surnames who are open and have no partner do not mind the relationship, after all, In the lonely and hard adventurer's career, the things that can enjoy the joy of the body and get rich rewards are things that many people can't refuse. Although Mr. Evans is young and handsome, elegant and elegant, he is generous, even if he does not take the initiative to seduce, there is no The girl surnamed adventurer is willing to share joy with him, but they belong to them, but they are very conservative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little thing needs you to deal with it." Lucien didn't tease the pure girl's mind and pointed to the carriage. "There are thieves who sneak in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Betty almost exclaimed, but she immediately covered her mouth, looked left and right, and found that after she woke up her sister and brother-in-law, she quickly went to the carriage. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When opening the door into the compartment, Betty suddenly thought: "Is there really a thief? Will it be that Mr. Evans deliberately lied to me?" Lies? If, if he wants to do something, am I sternly refusing, or shouting loudly? Or directly stun him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
