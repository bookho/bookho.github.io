			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the ancient castle that was always shrouded in darkness stood on the edge of the cliff, bathed in the cold moonlight, lonely and vicissitudes, and read the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien has become a dark-skinned werewolf, lurking in the virgin forest under the cliff, watching the spire seem to reach into the silver The observers of the month are the old castles, and in the surrounding forests, there are many dark creatures hidden in the cliffs, all of them staring at the castle with a little burning eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the knowledge is a little richer, it is not difficult for the intelligent creatures to discover the extraordinaryness of the observer castle. It is conceivable that some greedy dark powers have intentionally stolen. It seems that there is no owner's castle to die, and the rest is like a wolf waiting for prey, far away, often embarrassing, patiently waiting for the opportunity to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their backdrop, Lucien was relieved, no longer worried that his prying was a special reading, as bright as the lights in the dark. The reason why I did not rush into the Observer Castle was because I suspected that Prince Dracula would pay close attention to it. As the most powerful vampire, he has the ability to make the main points of surveillance, projection and other things to monitor the focus. Once the Rhine is discovered, he will come down in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where is his body? Lucien reluctantly believes that if it is himself, there is a good chance that he will choose the observer castle. After all, the Rhine has disappeared in the southern desert of the Gusta Empire, and there is no record of his entry into the "night plateau", even if he waits for the rabbit. In a place where the rabbit is easy to hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the patience of Prince Dracula, Lucien never doubts that the most incompetent of a legendary strongman who has lived for many years is patience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must think of a way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the formation of the black and black werewolf slow Slowly retreat from the forest under the cliff. Go directly to the chance that the Prince Dracula is not here, risking the inability to grasp, not the style of doing things by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the time spent completing the first three places of Magic Array is far less than expected, Lucian has plenty of time to plan, and the last step is needed. Choosing the brightest night of Silver Moon, even if you are in a hurry, you have to wait eight days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After far away from the Observer Castle, Lucien stopped the hidden figure, the brain turned quickly, and made the last few plans for the last few days. The scrutiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is a person who is completely trustworthy and willing to help me without knowing the secrets of the matter, the success may increase a lot..." Lucy Enshi’s figure flashed through the figure, but he hesitated. “This will involve her in danger.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the decaying soft soil, Lucien walked back and forth, and he was determined for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What would she say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the idea was overwhelmed, Lucien looked In front of a knotted tree, think of it as Natasha, imagine what Natasha will answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heroic woman wearing white body armor will definitely smile and replied: "Okay, that's it, but you have to create a piece of music as a gift." I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple, simply, neat, don't ask for extra words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose not to drag anyone down and complete the whole step yourself, and she will know it, she will laugh and laugh: "Although the world can finally rely on it." It’s only you, but not everything can be read, and people who don’t cherish their lives will never live forever. I think I’m still a brave knight to trust, maybe you don’t think of me as a true friend?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Lucien disarmed and took out a monocle to wear "Fernando's electromagnetic communication." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizzi’s cluttered current sounds under the quiet and deep depths of this dark forest, allowing Lucien to hear clearly, as the sound continues, time One minute and one second passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s early in the morning, Natasha may have taken off her earrings and sleep...wait again in the morning.” After about two minutes, no one responded. Lu Xien will end the electromagnetic communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it's me." Upon hearing this familiar voice, Lucien's mood became calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is funny and slightly delighted: "Are you near the Vaurit duchy? I only saw the one you sent at the end of June. The letter, I can't think of receiving your communication technique today. It was really scaring me. I just managed to get past Camille Auntie and hid in the garden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an illusion of a sneaky call from a parent. Lucien smiles and says, "I am in the dark mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am in trouble, need I am a brave and upright knight to help?" Natasha laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s tone became solemn: “One thing needs your help, but it can be dangerous.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted and said straight away: "Your position, I will come over immediately, so I decided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of tacit understanding Warm in the heart of Lucien, the voice softened: "You can bring Aunt Camille together, but you need to do something to marry her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is very clear. As the Countess of Violet, the heir to the Principality of Vaolirit, Natasha bears the love of Dagong and the loyalty to the aristocrats. In many cases, there is no way to act on his own mind, even if he takes risks, he needs Bring a guard. Since she does not intend to tell her the secret behind the matter, it is her respect and understanding to bring her to Camille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was wondering if you could tell Aunt Camille." Natasha’s laughter was also very soft. "Okay, will position and around." The characteristics tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we move at the same time and meet at the foot of the Skagen Peak in the Dark Mountains." Lucian chose a feature The place, and from Aalto to Skagen Peak, will not encounter too strong dark creatures along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before flying from Alto to the edge of the Dark Mountains, but once Entering the mountains, under the threat of many hidden dark creatures, the speed will be much lower, and sometimes even have to fall into the forest and sneak in. If you sway and do not care, the Knight of Heaven and the Golden Knight who are in the dark mountains are the best examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Lucien wearing a monocle was a little anxiously pacing back and forth, the silver moon shining on the smooth Skagen peaks. Reflecting the cold and dreamy brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did Natasha not arrive yet? Electromagnetic communication could not be connected..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the route chosen by myself is not dangerous to Natasha, and there are strange areas that the Rhine points to avoid, but it is not possible to see her at the time of arrival. Lucien is inevitably a bit worried, and it is difficult to understand the dark council. Those who happened to pass by in the vicinity, just happened to meet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, under the silver moon, two purple and black figures rushed out of the virgin forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Lucien breathed a sigh of relief and smiled and greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures stopped at the foot of the mountain, it was Natasha and Camille, both of whom wore full armor, and did not care about the dangers of the dark mountains. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Natasha is no longer wearing a creamy white, but a deep purple "Violet Guardian Armor" with a small but delicate left hand. With a deep sacred black shield, with her clear silver and purple eyes, dreamy purple long hair, beautiful but persevering face, really heroic "female god of war" look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shield of truth?" Lucien was still hesitating for a long time to reunite how to say hello, I can't think of it as if I just met yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille looked at Lucien deeply, his eyes were indifferent, making it difficult to guess what she thought, and then left the two, far from alert, Do not overhear the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha lifted the dark shield of the Holy Spirit: "Just a replica, I still can't hold the true shield of truth. Oh, my knight, What do you need to help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien took out the clown-like deformed mask: "You take it, and when it is the brightest of the silver moon six days later, wear it on a knight-class death row prisoner, and then let him become the portrait of Mr. Rhein. Hades Castle in the province of Tilan in the north, and let the owner of the castle notice that, remember, you must not distorted yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is In order to help me lead the vampire family of Prince Dracula, you have to grasp the opportunity to leave, can not always control the knight. Find a time to stun him, pretend to sleep, and quickly retreat."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least let Natasha know who the enemy is about to face, how terrible it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein was originally the strongest of the vampire family, no wonder..." Natasha was keenly aware of this, and then she rubbed her own light and white. A hard chin, "In this case, Prince Dracula will soon find out that it is not right. Is your time enough? Otherwise, simply turn it into an ambush, my teacher 'God of Glory', the Principality' The Chaos Serpent's Lord, and the Cardinal of Sir Sard, must have been interested in the enemies of the vampire prince, which will give you enough time, and Cardinal Sald can also invite the two saints to help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not asking the secret behind the matter, she began to look for a better way to deal with the existence of this legendary peak, the two saints, a Holy Spirit The priest, two epic knights, was sure to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Cardinal Serge has a big problem and can't go to him. There are no saints, no pastor of the Holy Spirit, relying on two epic knights, definitely not Prince Dracula’s opponent will even fall down directly.” Lucien shook his head and did not conceal Natasha. “The time is tight, but it is enough, I will not make fun of my life.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal of Sald had a problem... At the time there was something happening in the city of Aalto." Natasha did not doubt Lucian’s statement, a little dignified laugh "I believe that you love your life very much. You have just received so many awards and become the first genius of the genius of the legendary saga. It is sure to be full of expectation and yearning for future life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t say anything more, she chose to believe in Lucien’s judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lucien smiled at her in a complicated look, but she didn't have any reaction to look forward to. "Hey, this kind of thing is better than mine." The letters are much faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but I still like to read your letter." Natasha smiled openly, as a believer who did not study theology, she There is no contradiction in the matter of the separability of the atom. As for the miracle experiment, it has been so long. She has adapted to it and even felt faint. Then she smiled and asked, "You choose the vampire castle in the province of Tilan. Is it because it is very close to the northern fortress? Even if it was discovered by Prince Dracula, I have a great grasp of hiding into the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also because of Hades The owner of the castle is only a middle class..." Lucian did not answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s smile became faint, and then she looked up at Silvermoon: “Don’t delay time, I will go back and arrange things, yourself. Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Lucien is also a determined and determined person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking the deformation mask and leaving the breath, Natasha stunned: "Have you raised the ranks?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a high-level, you can't use this mask at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I paid a price to advance in advance." Lucien answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at Lucien with delight and concern, and did not hide her words: "It’s really unimaginable, I’m already at the same level as me. Lu Xien, the road you choose to be magic is really right, but you must not be too eager. Well, I have to improve as soon as possible, as soon as possible, can not be overtaken by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When she finished, she turned and flew to Camille. When she flew halfway, she suddenly turned back and smiled and said: "Lu Xien, are you not doing bad things this time?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am saving the world." Lucien answered half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
