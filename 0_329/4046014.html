In the morning, the pub was the quietest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance of the pub, a slender girl is looking inside secretly, the long blond hair is shaking slightly as her head turns left and right, when she When I sighed and turned my head, I was shocked: "Lu Xien?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another who knows me and I don't know? Lucien has been very comfortable with this situation, smiling: "So early to the pub?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's wheat-colored skin will bloom red: "I I just heard that a new bard came to the Copper Crown Pub. I was curious and thought about helping my mother to come over and see what happened. Well, time is running out, I will go first."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the girl rushed away, Lucien snorted softly, and it seemed that the bard's looks or songs were extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has nothing to do with Lucien himself, so he gently pushed open the half-covered pub door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dillow spaces, strong wine, squeaky wooden floors, messy tables and chairs, this is Lucien’s crown The first impression of the pub came in from the refreshing, bright morning outside, just like coming to another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien adapted for a while before seeing where the bar is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several men in the pub who were hangovers here, and they were awakened by the sound of Lucien’s stepping on the floor, and after a few words of cursing,继续 Continue to sleep on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a 30-year-old man with a hooked nose, wearing a black tight-fitting long coat, sitting quietly on the chair next to the bar, slowly Drinking a glass of amber wine gave Lucien a feeling of gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the arrival of Lucien, the gloomy man just took a glance and continued to taste the wine in his cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around and saw the dwarf sleeping behind the bar. He sat on a high sole stool and his head leaned back. At the bar, the snoring sounds loud, and the flowing saliva will wet the golden long beard with a bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing no external force, the dwarf does not seem to wake up for a long time, Lucian had to bend his fingers and slammed on the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the drunken buzz, the old dwarf swayed and slowly raised his head, his eyes whispering: "Hey, Lucien, you have grown up, and finally understand the meaning of wine for life, come, have a drink, and cheer for our new guests!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Uncle Uncle, it’s dawn." Lucien asked for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩揉 blinked and looked at the dim light around me: “I’m not drunk, don’t you want to lie to me, it’s obviously night, what a wonderful night Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a meaningless conversation, Yan En finally woke up completely: "Lu Xien, there are not many things for you to do, temporarily There is no long-term work. The other thing, one is at 9 o'clock in the morning. The Gucci shop in the market area needs a batch of goods from the warehouse to the Shing Mun area, lacking manpower, three copper fairs, but you also know that This kind of thing is controlled by Aaron gangsters, and finally they need to pay a copper ferry to them, and the rest can only buy the worst black bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is one more thing. The musicians association is doing a big cleaning today. There is a lot of garbage that needs to be sent to the Belem River outside the city. You rent a four-wheeled cart. After a little past, the money for renting a cart is removed. I can earn eight copper fairs back and forth, very good, of course, I need to give Aaron a gang of three copper fairs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "A little more than a few afternoons, there are a few similar things, but unless you are a knight, you can't get back from outside the city." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Uncle, is there anything else that is more rewarding?" Lucien asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩 laughed: "Ha ha ha, of course, but it is not for you, it is the real man who needs life and strength to fight, the road Sean, you are still a child who doesn't dare to drink ale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he pointed to the open space in the middle of the pub and became a bit serious: "The dark mountains are the biggest." Treasures, three, five, six, seven every year, forget it, I really can't count, in short, many mercenaries, adventurers have entered the dark mountains, but finally can come out, only a very small part... ..." Yann made a cellar. "Of course, they all get rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t underestimate these mercenaries, adventurers, but among them There are quite a few real knights, even big knights." A soft and magnetic surname sounded behind Lucien, and the end of every sentence was very eccentric, showing a strange rhythm and beauty, giving a temptation. Elegant feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was busy looking back and saw the pub open as a side of the hotel, coming out of a silver-haired man, stovepipe pants, red jacket, high collar Black jacket, clearly formal clothing, worn on him, but it seems very lazy and casual, facial features deep and fine, silver pupil, strong nose, thin lips, with a silvery soft hair, demon Handsome, seeing him, it seems that there is a kind of beauty that sees the silver moon at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man holds a harp similar to Joel and walks slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the new bard?" Lu Xien guessed in his heart, and then asked questioningly: "The knights are real aristocrats, why are they still? Will you go to the Dark Mountains to venture for wealth?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇 greet: “Hey, Rheinland, don’t you have a drink?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only drink at night." Rhein smiled and sat down next to the bar. "In many countries in the east, there have been no wars in two or three hundred years. The need for the knight is not so urgent. After all, a knight is required to be given to the manor and the land, so even if the civilians inspire the blood, they will get the knighthood at the most, and they will not become true aristocrats. Some of them go to other countries and become other countries. The Cavaliers, some of the nearest places in the Principality of Vaorrit, the heretics, the infidels, the dark creatures, the World of Warcraft, etc., to build merits and find wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In addition, there are many bankrupt poverty knights, knights who have escaped from crimes. The guardian of the family, the aristocratic knight who cruised the mainland, and the power of the blood, but because of the dark surname, not recognized by the church, or even chased the dark knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;寇恩嘟 囔囔 几 , , , , , 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 嘟 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵 莱茵Knowing the wisdom, just got rid of the enthusiasm of the Tria ladies, coming from the ancient kingdom of Syria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Syracuse Kingdom?" Lucien smiles Nod to the Rhein, the dark mountains are so dangerous, even the real knights are dead in them, so Lucien temporarily dispelled the idea of ​​seeking for wealth, no matter when, the clear understanding of their own strength is very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩哈哈 laughed, the long golden beard swayed violently, the wrinkled dwarf face said with a man who knows: "Yes It is the passionate, unrestrained, and love-ridden kingdom of Syracuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drunkard woke up when he appeared in the Rhine, stumbled Going to the bar, drinking a wine cellar, full of yearning and envy, asked: "Rhein, the ladies and ladies of Tria, is it so beautiful in the legend, grace, so passionate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein with a faint smile, in his own unique, elegant, rhythmic tone: "Well, they have morning-like bright eyes, silky smooth long hair Rose-like lips, milky and smooth skin, full of charm and perfume, several countess, Miss Viscount, even spit out a warm, moist fragrance in my ear, invite me to Their secret estate is a guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunken He asked: "Do you what it's like to go??" Breathing becomes rapid up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is no stranger to such a scene, a bunch of men get together, always talk about women, while listening with interest, thinking How to ask for a letter to learn the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
