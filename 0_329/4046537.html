			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the death valley that has disappeared, Fernando, Hathaway and Begner floated in the sky, watching this devastated scene, left behind after the heat Estimates of the temperature and power of the explosion, such as shocking traces and huge potholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is really an explosion of magic, is the sun a planet that keeps on exploding?" Bergner asked in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his hostile "gather explosion", but the "sun" that is in the star of the starry system and has a very important position in the star map of destiny. A mysterious color has faded, and its mystery has been revealed. As a prophet, he will inevitably have a feeling of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Fernando killed the demigod lich, Bergner did not leave in anger, because if Congers’ reason was, it was obviously two living The Great Arcane Master is more important than a dead legendary magician, and if you don't start from Congos's defense and simply consider the rules of the parliament, Fernando is even more wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the storm dominated the rules of the parliament, and let people forget that his eager and violent surname is not only reflected in the debate on academic issues, but also forgot his The legendary profession and nickname, until he suddenly started, Bergner suddenly took it for granted, this is the "storm dominate" this move, so I accepted this result with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando shook his head: "In a strict sense, it’s not explosive magic. I haven’t found any special traces of traditional explosive magical remnants here, only pure Energy release, unimaginable high temperature, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately added a tradition in front of the elemental faction explosion magic, apparently considered a new explosion form Close to the mystery of the sun's illumination, along this path, the light and dark and electromagnetic factions can be partially incorporated into the field of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Hathaway nodded lightly and agreed with Fernando's conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophet who is not good at the elemental field, Begner heard a sigh: "I can't imagine Lucien Evans can create such magic." But I vaguely have a feeling of changing times, perhaps from this moment, no, from the theory of energy theory proposed by Lucien, arcane and magic have entered an era of magical and frightening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sentence of Fergner, Fernando and Hathaway have no expression, but from the eyes and silent attitude, they can see that they are thinking In this regard, what a prophet said cannot be easily ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two figures flew from a distance, and Fernando’s hand clenched into a fist quietly loosened, and the face was slammed. Dao: "You are so stupid this time, you don't know how to move your hands and feet! You are so forced to enter the door of the outside world! I will pay you back next time. The body, no, even the body can not be found!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien enjoys the long-lost roaring storm and looks at the teacher’s almost blind expression I was very kind, so I quickly admitted the mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother, how come you come so early? We thought it was going to be at night or in the early hours of the morning." Natasha often listened to Lucien’s teacher’s “roaring” "After seeing such a situation, it was a funny look, ready to record, for later use by the road, but after a while, I do not know why, she could not help but transfer the topic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri looked at Natasha, her expression was softer, and she said: "We killed Congos, from the door of his outside world." "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You killed Congos?" Lucien was shocked and happy, and was still worried that "Eternal Blazing" could not be completely killed. Congos, who had a talisman and died, was escaped by him, and he was infinitely troubled. He could not think that the problem had been solved by the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers must have withstood a lot of pressure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He damn it!" Fernando did not change his true color, and then he converges on the expression of "Blowing the Beard", like a smile: "You are this magic. What happened? We saw that the Unreal Sun should have been made by you that day? What is the existence of Silver Moon and the Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hathaway stood quietly, and at this moment interjected: "All people have seen, is the legendary magic derived from the new alchemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is keen on anyone who is delving into new alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I discovered some phenomena when I studied atomic decay, and I summed up a lot of things. After I first killed Congos, I got through and got The world feedback, harvested the prototype of two legendary magic, also ignited the scene you saw, and later, with the power of the silver moon, the "eternal blaze", that is, the subject of the legendary magic of 'atomic fusion' is completed and Released." Lucien did not reveal the special theory of relativity and mass energy, but proceeded from the experimental phenomenon encountered in the new alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The derivation of the special theory of relativity is actually not difficult. With the current level and predecessor of the Magic Council, as long as anyone can overcome the inherent point of view, it will not be within a few years. Difficult to ask, but it is this inherent point of view that made Lucien afraid to immediately show this paper to the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the volatility of light or particle theory is the basis of different factions, the composition of the cognitive world and the meditation, then the view of time and space It is one of the "common senses" of every arcist's understanding of the world. It comes from the usual, intuitive, and does not think that there are any wrong feelings. For example, ordinary people will have time to quietly pass, not for The feeling of anything 'moving'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, for every arcian, absolute, reading, and mathematical time perspectives are the foundation of their outlook on life and worldview, and they are universal It is believed that the "time stillness" of the nine-ring magic only solidifies part of the area, slowing down the movement, not the escape time in the true sense, similar to the sublimation of slow surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the content of the special theory of subversive subversion is not a qualitative energy formula, but rather a relative space-time view that it gives, seems to tell people that time is a function of speed, dependent on matter This is no less than the subversive storm caused by the energy sub-theory, and its proposal also announced the end of the "Ether". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the initial research on fission and fusion does not require the guidance of the quality formula, so Lu Xien temporarily concealed, and slowly let the teacher accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien silently repented in his heart: "Every time there is a theory of subversion of the surname, the teacher is the first to bear the brunt, I am so sorry for him, Hey, fission and fusion should help him to go one step further?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando seriously said: "Measuring? Is another fission?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decay of the element found so far is obviously fission, so he has this question, and there is a little excitement in his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fissile release energy, fusion will also?" Hathaway pointed to the essence, the pair of silver-purple eyes on the delicate and pure face revealed a trace fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They completely forgot that this is the area controlled by the church. Forgot the horrific and maddening "Da Ivan" explosion, which floated in the air. The issue of atomic fission and fusion was discussed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was once again used by Lucien "Science", listening to the gusto, interpreting from time to time, the prophet who is not good at the elements, Begner, heard dizziness Dizzy, simply do the alert on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly speaking, Lucien said: "Teacher, Lord Hathaway, the previous fusion explosion should have alarmed the northeast direction of Warren Hill, we Let's leave here first. This is not a short-term discussion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Valen Hill? Hey, he dares to come. Excuse me?” The storm dominated Lu Xi’an, two great arcans, a legendary second-level prophet, and a feared monk leader who did not even have the title of Saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the Pope came in person, Fernando would believe in the strength of his own side, although he could not beat it, but he was injured. It is not difficult to escape the cost. The legendary magician can kill more than any occupation, unless it is surrounded and blocked, and there are prophets who want to sneak around and kill themselves. It is completely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Fernando still restrained his desire to explore the Arcane and continued: "First return to Allinge, will be with Silvermoon, Necromancer The things that have happened in the world are organized into reports. If you want, you can tell Masjilin’s things. You can’t face the dead world alone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Natasha took the opportunity to leave and was ready to return to the Knights of the Vaughan Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk back later." Natasha didn't have a parting mourning, laughing at Lucien's gesture of electromagnetic communication, and then privately and again. Hathaway exchanged a few words, and it took a leisurely flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of her flying away, Fernando showed a wretched smile: "Lu Xien, your emotional path is very difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it seen? Lucien said: "What are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don't be shy, teacher, but I have a lot of emotional experience, what have not experienced Don't look at my singleness now, that's because I have been obsessed with this aspect, and I have returned to what you said and what is going back to the realm. Any emotional problems can also be consulted." Fernando unceremoniously laughed at himself. student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Holm Capital Rantat, Nexel Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver candlestick burns a white candle, and the dim light is reflected by the rain and lightning outside, revealing the sad and desolate taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt, who wears a white soft hat and must be white, looks at the King of Fertis, lying on the bed: "His Majesty, your life is early." It has been done a few months ago and has been maintained by magic. But now, even if the magic can no longer continue your life, but everything is ready, you can return to the Lord with peace of mind. Embrace, you can rest assured that death is not the end, you will have eternal happiness in Paradise Hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fertis's murky eyes are now clear, Showing a bit of self-blame, but being replaced by more responsibility and firmness, the voice is intermittent: "Respected Saint-Salt... Rex, the next thing... is handed over to you, Holm The kingdom has always been...and will always be the kingdom of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker of the House of Lords, Duke of Flensburg, facing the king who had been loyal to many years The expression is full of mourning, kneeling on one knee, holding the right hand of Fertis: "His Majesty, I will not disappoint you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is my mission to add glory to the Lord. Your Majesty, you can rest assured that His Royal Highness will not break into hell." Thrall draws on his chest. The cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, a huge flash of lightning crossed, illuminating the entire room, Fertisius closed his eyes with a smile, his right hand unable to slide down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Earl of Pine was awakened from his sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? The King’s majesty was called by the Lord? Come on, prepare the carriage!” Earl of Pines stood up from the bed and walked outside in pajamas. The countess quickly followed, putting a long black dress on him and handing his cane to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the usual elegant and calm Earl of Pines almost ran to the carriage at the door of the villa, and then the voice was a bit sharp and said: "Quick, go to Nexel Palace! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't stimulate the blood, the speed of running was far less than that of the dragon scale horse dragging the carriage, and the person carrying it went to expose the inner panic, so, Even if he is in a hurry, he can only sit in the car, sort out the clothes, and make himself look very calm, in order to give confidence to other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom, lightning strikes, huge roaring sounds, this seems to be the embodiment of the uneasy inner heart of the sea pine, the carriage is driven by the driver, flying fast, splashing High mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four wheels turned sharply, and when they turned the dark streets, they almost threw the entire car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window opens, the wind blows in, the raindrops of the size of the beans pour into it, and the night outside is like ink, which seems to contain endless fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped outside the Necker Palace, and the Earl of Pines rushed into the palace in a heavy rain. At this time, he saw the Duke of James standing at the door. Duke Russell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
