			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at Lucien, Eric continued to read the contents of the review: "Mr. Jeffrey’s evaluation is: 'fascinating Experimental design, rigorous exploration and construction of magic. Although limited by its own knowledge and ability, its construction of magic has many defects, but this paper shows not how good this apprentice level magic, but high frequency sound waves It can be used as a tool for positioning and exploration. This has given us a new direction in the study of sound waves. This is a paper with the contribution of creating a surname.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because of its simplicity of discussion, without delving into the bat's organ structure and positioning principle, and the lack of foreseeable development of this principle, the important surname of this paper is not enough. Of course, as a no The magician of the official arcane level has done very well. At the same time, this paper also shows that ordinary creatures also have the magical ability, which is also worthy of our research and exploration. It cannot be limited to them. It is enough to be seen in running, jumping, agility, discoloration, strength, etc., but should go deeper into observation.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Another satisfying place is The author's way of thinking is the real arcane thinking mode: keen observation, bold assumptions, experimental exclusion, rigorous analysis, reasonable inference and application. It is surprising that he does not have an arcane level.'<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In all aspects, it is recommended to reward four Arcane points and four Arcane points.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Member's assessment results, Lucien Evans's paper is: 'creating the contribution of the surname, the important surname is insufficient, the experiment is clear and rigorous, with discussion and research value, rewarding four arcane points, five arcane Point.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with Mr. Garfield, this "Jeffrey" is very embarrassing, so detailed, but his final review The assessment results are still strikingly similar to Garfield, apparently full Lucien can be worth this paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, his detailed explanation also allowed Eric and Lazar to roughly understand the theme of Lucien's arcane thesis and new magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the effects of high-frequency sound waves on positioning and exploration by studying the organs of bats? Although Evans inherits ancient magic, this is your strength, but I also often study bats, but unfortunately I studied its gliding ability but forgot other aspects. It is really regretful." As a two-ring magician, trying to resolve the "flight" of the most important surname in the three-ring magic Lazar was observing most of the creatures that could fly, so he smiled and complained to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he has no doubts about Lucien’s ability to write this arcane paper. After all, this is the direction that ancient magicians are good at, so he sincerely embraces Lucien said: "Congratulations, Evans, you are the magician who has so many arcane points on the first day I have seen. After you have made up for the basics of arcane and magic over time, you will definitely get it. The official level of arcane is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of high-level arcans, even if there is no new research results, may be due to the accumulated papers within one day Get hundreds of Arcane points, so seven Arcane points a day are not shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how can the bats and high-frequency sound waves, positioning, and exploration of these three words be linked?" After releasing Lucien, Lazar Curiously asked, Eric next to him stopped reaching out to the iron cage and looked back at Lucien to hear why he was rated as "amazing and sharp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lucine was thinking about language, Lazar added a sigh of relief: "Your paper has been approved, you don't have to worry about our plagiarism, and if you can Let Mr. Eric interested, maybe he will go to the 'Ordinary Arcane Library' to inquire about your thesis, and write a new paper to get the quoted Arcane points."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's actually very simple, Lazar, have you seen bats flying in the dark night or in the caves? Especially in the caves, there are so many bats in the dark, they can Fly as you like without hitting your companions and stone walls." Lucien smiled and said a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the presence of two of the Arcane ranks, this passage is already very telling, and Eric subconsciously rationalizes the rich middle of the poor hair around him. "Some of the results of arcane research are simple to say, but there is no sharp observation. No arcist asks for exploratory thinking. I can't find it. I don't think I can miss a lot if I don't know it. The opportunity to publish high-reviewed papers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar sighed: "I think about raising a variety of creatures in my own home, carefully observing their small habits, and maybe even like Lucien in the future - just getting a lot of arcanes through auditing. Points and higher ratings. Hey, Lucien you already have seven Arcane points!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien is not concealing, Lazar feels He really is a friend worthy of contact, so he does not reproduce the name of Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it has been evaluated as having a contribution to create a surname in the field of soundwave applications, if Evans submits a paper to a suitable journal, it will definitely be included. After a period of research and exploration, the Arcticians who came to your thesis will be the main source of your upgraded Arcane level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After about two or three months, their papers should be published one after another. Hehe, if you have not obtained the basic arcane points through our arcane assessment within three months, you will be the first to have more than ten The Arcane points have no official Arcane level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric thinks of such a thing, his face is filled with a suspicious smile, obviously Very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Eric’s words, Lucien asked the previous topic: “My paper is limited to a small aspect of the application of sound waves. I am afraid that the number of citations will be very small. Mr. Eric, which journal do you think I should choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you can clearly realize This is very good, I am worried that you will have too much hope." Lazar said next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric nodded: "And after your paper has been cited more, the arcanes who study the field later will gradually refer to the previous paper. Not your original paper, so the citation points will slowly decline, tending to an intermittent, rare but stable state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To get more The number of citations, of course, is the selection of journals whose influences are often quoted on the above-mentioned papers. "Arcane" and "Magic" are the most famous and influential journals in the entire magic world, but they have long been used by the Arcanists. High-level Arcanists monopolize. Low-level Arcanists can't be included unless they have both a surname, a surname, and an important surname. Evans should not consider them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are 42 other journals, including the journals of the eleven major factions, the journals sponsored by the seven magic parliamentary divisions, three excerpts of indexed journals, and eighteen small Journals in the field, three specifically for the beginning The comprehensive surname journal of the Arcanist. As for the journals and newspapers sponsored by several magicians and published in a small area, they are self-entertainment and mutual communication needs. Although the number is large, they have not been approved by the audit committee. The quote will not get the Arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened to Eric’s words and couldn’t help but think: “The Magic Council has not yet launched. The algorithm of journal influence? But the number of journals is so small, but it doesn't use the influence of calculation. Everyone has an intuitive feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements and The journals such as the Holm Journal are also influential, and can be widely quoted in their factions or their own magical parliamentary divisions, but the requirements are equally strict, and the journals of the Magical Parliamentary Division are mainly directed at the personnel within the division. Evans's direction of your arcane thesis is too small, not important enough, and it is directly under the parliamentary headquarters, so it is difficult to be published, and it is not worth taking risks in terms of probability." Eric as the deacon of the "Magician Management Department", recognized Analysis is Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly: "Mr. Eric, do you suggest me to choose a small field journal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;""Sonic" is the most authoritative journal in this field, and its influence is not high but not low. Although the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" is not an authority in this field, it is aimed at the synthesis of middle and lower level arcans. Surname journals have a higher influence than Sonic. Both of them have higher requirements, and Lu Xien’s papers have great hopes and risks.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ericton has said: "If you vote for the "Arcane Discussion" and "Magic Research Monthly" two comprehensive surname journals for ordinary arcans, I can be sure that Evans you The papers will be included, but they will have the worst influence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for how to choose, whether it is risky or safe, look at Evans yourself. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
