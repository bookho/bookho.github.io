			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Recommended ticket support on Monday, um, future update time will return to normal, Monday to Friday, 8:30 am to 9:00 am, 6:30 pm At seven o'clock, two days on weekends, around 12 noon, around 6:30 pm. ................................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jackson pinches his chin, revealing an ordinary smile: "Andre, I have done a good job recently, yes, what are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Andrei did not agree with the smile: "Jackson's big brother, just a small thing, I saw a young man who knows, in recent days, going out to the city every day, so it is a bit strange."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did he go out with, then come back with something, did you notice?" Jackson was very smiling, but I don't know why, Andre and Mag are both It's a bit chilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mag has claimed that one-sixteenth of the Aachen Highland Barbarian lineage is a villain whose faith is only a little worse than the god of truth, by Jackson. When I asked this question, it was difficult to answer immediately, and Andrea was a little normal. After recalling for a while, I couldn’t say with certainty: "It seems to be with a worn linen bag. When you come back, when you come back. Well, there seems to be something in the bag, but this season, in the Black Forest opposite the Belém, when the mushroom is the most, he may be going to pick mushrooms?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need a young man with a strong effort to pick mushrooms? The edge of the Black Forest is not dangerous, the little girl, the little boy is enough." Jackson shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre boldly asked: "But, Big Brother Jackson, what kind of weirdness can he have such a dirty and poor boy?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alto has a total of three gates, the busiest facing the Belém River and the Melzer Black Forest, the busiest merchants, civilians, mercenaries, There are so many adventurers, Andre and Mag are energetic to pay attention to Lucy, a poor boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson smiled and laughed: "The day before, the blacksmith Regg came to me. He bought a good piece of metal from a young man. It was those who had money. The copper that is in the position of the upper class, which is only the most inferior, is helpful for building a sharper dagger. Therefore, he is very curious about the origin of the copper. I want to try it. The source is in our hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Jackson, do you mean that the copper was sold to Luigi by Lucien?" The muscle brain directly links the two, regardless of whether there is evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson nodded slightly: "He was very careful, Regg could not track him, the copper fragments were also processed, and I couldn’t see the calendar, so I was full. It took more than a day to find a clue from the market area. He has shot too many times in the past few days, and it is inevitable to leave an impression. Some people will see that he will always come to the Shing Mun area at this time, huh, I don't think you know him, it would be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dr. Jackson, what do we need to do?" Andre was busy asking Jackson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson pointed to the city gate: "Tell me his identity first, then quietly follow him to see where he got it, if When he found out, he would subdue him and torture him directly, and the copper of his body would be for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Big Brother Jackson." Mag. Grab the answer in front of Andre, the flesh of his face shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t used his fists to teach others for ten days, and he has become so excited that he has become excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holding a linen bag and walking to the Belem River On the side of the road, he suddenly got the method of making money. In fact, after the first half of the excitement, he calmed down and wondered why he was not found to be abnormal. At least until he was able to find five Yinnar, he was not discovered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have paid more attention to many aspects, I have never had the experience of doing this kind of thing, and I am not familiar with the different worlds. It is hard to say whether there will be The missing place, well, according to the plan, go to the gate area for one day tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, go out from the gate of the Nolan District and change to the gate of the Violet District in three days.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucian, who thought about things, suddenly, there was a feeling of being followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who will follow me?" Lucien was full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he was almost killed by Gary in the sewer, Lucien found himself mentally sensitive and has a sensory ability to rely on this, these days When selling goods, he can smoothly get rid of the tracking of possible greedy generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t dare to have the slightest meaning, Lucien pretends to be nothing, just passing a corner of the flat road, stalking the grass, trees, etc. Opportunity, immediately rushed up, then slammed into the sparse woods, hiding behind a big tree, waiting for the followers to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very calm at this time, to figure out who is tracking himself, so that you can think about the way to deal with it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a minute or two, two heavy footsteps rang and stopped at the corner, then stretched out and looked at the road west. Where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, that kid ran away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre, long ago I should listen to me, no matter where he goes, grab him directly, smash it, and know everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Unable to hide, the curse of impatience was introduced to Lucien’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was strange that this voice was very familiar, but when Magma called out the name of "Andre", he immediately came over: "Asia The gangsters suspected me? So fast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Lucien didn’t have too much entanglement, why was it discovered so soon, because there are many The strange world of methods and means, gently sighed, and planned to wait for the two to leave, immediately went to another city gate, went back to his home, took out the hidden Yinal and Copper Fair, and found a The place was hiding for a few days. After that, it was a big deal to promise John to go to Sir Wien’s estate as an apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre and Magg argued for a minute, seeing Lucien really disappeared and became frustrated, Jackson was very heart-wrenching. I am afraid that there is nothing to end with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mag, don't you always boast that you have a barbarian bloodline, can you tell the taste of the wind?" Andre suddenly remembered that when the horse was bragging One thing that has been mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mag touched his bald head and said with a sly voice: "I forgot for a moment. And sometimes I can tell, sometimes I can't tell." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Lucien heard the conversation between the two people, the vigilant emotions came out again, and they only passed through for a few days, the means of doing things. And the method still lacks understanding of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mag raised his head and sucked his nose deeply. Suddenly, he cried excitedly: "I smell the smell of the damn boy." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While squatting, he took a big step and ran towards the big tree where Lucien was hiding, and Andrea followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucie called out, he had already turned and fled, trying to get rid of the two by speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that although Magg is tall and strong, he has muscles, but he runs very fast, and the distance from Lucien is getting more and more Short, if there were times when he was afraid of hitting the tree, he could already catch Lucien’s clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest on the riverside of the Belém River is very sparse. Lucien runs and runs, and his eyes become wide open, and he can no longer rely on trees and evade Maga. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien was not too alarmed. Compared to Gary’s high-ranking knight attendant, Mag’s sense of oppression was inferior, not to mention those dense. Red eyes and mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't run anymore, you can catch up with Marg and Andre has a chance to get a break, first knock down Mag." Lucien soon Made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
