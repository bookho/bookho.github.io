			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being blinded by greed, being deceived by the devil, Thrad, you have forsaken the Lord's teachings, will suffer forever." Pope Benedict II The world said in a low-spirited manner, there was a wonderful beating between the rhythms, which seemed to make people's conscience awakened and repented with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still maintains a calm and calm attitude, as if as Thrad bowed his head and repented, he would be able to re-baptize him and forgive his sins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korsard understands very well that this attitude is nothing, but the more it is, the more the Pope has made up his mind, the heresy is ten thousand more than the pagans. Times, and trying to seize their power and murder their heresy, it is 10,000 times more than the pagans, and they have to step on countless feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely no possible relationship with reconciliation. The reason why the Pope should use the language to mix the magic is to relax his vigilance. He still can't figure out his own. The secrets of the body and the support behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde looked up, and the panic that had just disappeared for a moment had completely disappeared, and it was necessary to send all the cards, like the true saints who defended the Lord’s glory and screamed. He replied: "The past priests took control of the Lord's authority, stole the glory of the Lord, and nicknamed himself the Lord's spokesperson of the earth. Above the Lord of the Angel closest to the Lord, he was the greatest pagan. I listened to the Lord. Instigation, with the support of the King of Angels, is to remove your biggest devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are really blinded by the so-called secret. Benedict II raised the scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two talking, Natasha, who is next to her, has been hurrying to converge on the extraordinary power of her body, quietly and dignified and gradually withdrawing from the heavens on earth, although there is truth. The sword is a legendary third-order item. She does not have any confidence to survive in the aftermath of the battle between the Pope and Thrall. She only hopes that the heavens will block the first wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde didn’t say anything more, the temperament changed, the body seemed to have something more, the ethereal and ethereal, the ethereal high, and then came out of Pope Benedict II. Locked, flashing thousands of miles, this strength is absolutely legendary peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray for the devil of sovereignty, accept the trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict II Platinum scepter, tearing the space, chasing Sarder to the sea of ​​clouds opposite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the creator and the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reading these verses, Sa Deer seems to be in another world, and his body is full of sacred white light, a feeling of condescending and super-extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All believers in the city of Rentatt, at the same moment, moved inexplicably, tears of joy followed by prayers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earth of the Earth on the Earth has settled down. The winds and waves that had been crumbling in the legendary battles have subsided, and the sound of gentleness and tranquility has spread: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde's facial wrinkles appear at a rate visible to the naked eye, and the skin's luster is lost The whole person is like a dry corpse. His right hand is lifted up. The seven heavens in the sky are projected. The holy light will cover up the sun. The ethereal, joyful and melodious songs and praises will sound together. Countless rays begin to go to the seventh. The layer is boundless Inter light group gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This familiar scene undoubtedly shows one thing, that is, Sard can actually use:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a qualified conspirator, his own strength is always the foundation of all planning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you have accepted His power, and have come into contact with that secret, going further than the northern heresy. No wonder you dare to hit the throne, but You are not afraid to directly exhaust life and death?" The Pope suddenly changed to the most primitive belief-sensing communication method. There were some accidents and a bit of calm. "Is it tempting the king of angels, or is he tempting you... ...what did you encounter in the realm of the dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde regained his turbid eyes and looked at Pope Benedict II: "Go with God Surgery, I don't necessarily die, but I am caught by you, I am sure to die, that secret, there is only one person in the world who can master, as for what I have encountered, wait for you to catch me and ask again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of communication is a spiritual level of communication, completed in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict II smiles and raises the Platinum Scepter in his hand again. Pisard is more magnificent, sacred and supreme, overlooking the holy light of everything. Wrap him in the whole person, devoutly and devoutly::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s an instant, and it’s eternal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s the creator and the master.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers of Rentart City, the believers of the entire Holm parish, the believers of the holy city of Reims, and all the clergy of these places, the emotions of moving joy are either deeper or slower Come out and follow the prayers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one and also 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes In an instant, it is also eternal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict II has deep eyes as if there are countless 璀璨Stars, they are connected to the mold of the cross , But behind the mountain paradise projected chant and light wind came down Bisaerde clearer, and let him go narrative of God descending surgery was strongly interference, managed to stabilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Thrad sees that Benedict II has no fear of consuming life and is about to die, slightly awkward, and this god-dropping seems normal There are no different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben’s mouth curled up, revealing a mocking smile: “You thought you had mastered this secret for so many years, I will not have a more in-depth study of it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for death, it is not that terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His appearance is also Rapid aging, but the extent of the Pisard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heresy, accept the judgment of the Lord!" The paradise of heaven on the sky above Benedict II converges into the seventh floor, and then endless The milky white light drowns the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thrard also played his own gods down: "Stealing the devil of sovereignty, accept the trial!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky has nothing more than the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God to the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city of Rentatt, not covered by the "land of heaven" Magic Council alternate contact team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned on electromagnetic communication, connected the artificial planet, and sent intelligence to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the dark mountains, Staniss, with the cooperation of the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, successfully took him out of Aalto and threw them into the magic tower. Then he opened the door of the alien that had been prepared long ago and arrived at a place where countless volcanoes rolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight into the palace among the volcanoes, and the majestic voice of the "Danisus", the time of the ancient times, was heard from the depths of the palace. "Stannis, what are you doing? Want to join us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danissos was silent, with a bitter hate in his voice: "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its wife was killed by the Pope God." Aphroda, the Magic Council, through the relationship with the Prince of Werewolf, the Lord of the Eyes, and the ancient inheritance of the magician, "adjusted" the order of the Dark Parliament headquarters, let it "just happen" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look for the help of the Dark Council in advance, because many of their legendary powerhouses are also very hostile to the Magic Council, it may be counterproductive, it is better to hold one The legendary Taikoo Time Dragon said, and don't give it more time to weigh! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I think Dracula is more willing to let them fight for a while, and both sides have serious losses before they start." This is the inside of the Dark Council. I don’t listen to anyone’s situation, but God’s fall is a great deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanley smiled and said: "This is a very good idea, but why not come to the dessert before the big meal, the strength of many places in the church is empty, knocked out One or two Holy Spirit pastors or epic knights are the harvest of the real surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus suppresses hatred: "I will inform Dracula, Rhein first They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he wondered: "Rhine is gone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the high altitude outside the "land of heaven", looking at the ocean of light that is like the exchange of sea and blue sky, Lucy En quite afraid of it, will Sarde also God down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is beyond all expectations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Lu Xien no longer worried about anything, directly over the outer magic defense, rushed to the Natasha Palace, just because he did not come in, he was worried The pope came to wipe away himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of being transformed by himself, Lucien understands the weaknesses and loopholes of the outer defense, and easily and simply sees the Nata exiting from the "land of heaven" Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be brave and firm as her, the right hand holding the sword of truth can not help but tremble slightly, the biggest risk in the plan three is her, if the pope does not Believe, if Thrad arrives, then lose the best chance to escape. If the Pope believes, but also guessed that she also has problems, then she will kill her by the way, if the front is doing very well, can be two The aftermath of the war was more than estimated, so that she could not resist and escape with the sword of truth. It would also die, and it was a dangerous egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can you do something big? The only thing that wins the victory without risk is the fact that the power is crushed, and Lucien also wastes a legendary item for himself. If so, why not face the danger like a real knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stabilizes her emotions: "I am fine, I am now hurrying to hold a nobility meeting, unite the front, influence the general trend and the decisions of the epic knights, you go to control The center of the enchantment of the Rantat City, the Lord Winston will stop Ketonia, he will not help me, but it will not stop you, otherwise it will completely fall to the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the legendary battle, the aristocrats who came here did not dare to leave, and the whole city of Rentart was the safest of Nexus Palace with the defensive array of defenses. Of course, they have been Looking for an opportunity to escape to the outside of the city, but unfortunately do not understand the mystery of the "land of heaven", the more toss, the more unsuccessful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Lucien didn't have a jealousy, this was a waste of time to exchange feelings. At the same time, Lucien walked sideways to the side palace. The silver-haired man nodded: "Thank you, thank you Mr. Rhein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome man in black shirt and red jacket is "The Ear of Silver Eye" Rhein, he Hehe smiled: "According to the previous promise, I will let you pick a legendary item after I get out of trouble. Since you are willing to give up, in exchange for me to protect Natasha for a while, I have no opinion. I don't have many legends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can borrow the power of the silver moon, unless the pope ignores the death of his life, otherwise there is a great possibility to save Natasha from fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you don't tell me in advance, if you know the enemy is Sarder..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
