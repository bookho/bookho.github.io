			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the projection of the nine-layered hell, the flame-filled devil climbs out of the burning world, and the devil in the nose is bathed in magma, the skin The pale, cold devil rushes to Lucien, Natasha, and the demigod lich with a cold wind deep into the soul. The sorcerer in the bronze castle makes a bloody scream... with the Lord of the Inferior Mardi Moss As the advent, countless devil projections formed the legion, and the horror was extremely extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a golden skull of the half-god Lich Congos, after a brief horror, opened his mouth and made a sharp scream in the soul. A burst of shock spread, the death breath rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of volcanoes, rocks, castles, etc. in the "Half-God Lich" range, but suddenly, one or two meters high The high-order devil who wielded the flame swords fell silently, the black wings behind it were unable to fall, the soul flame was completely extinguished, as if it was "infected" by it, and a piece of devil fell like harvested oats. In just one or two seconds, the first wave of the demon army was all dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life Sacrifice." After Congos advanced, it became easier to cast legendary magic, both of which were "stained" by his half-face. Between the "land" and the legendary "half-the-go lich" relying on "the magic of the job", the cast buffer is much less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of Congus falling, the flames of the eruption turned gray, the rocks lost their moisture, and the stinky swamps dried up, The bronze castle decayed and faded, and the cold wind in the silent plains became more and more whistling. The devils who died just stood up one by one, the skin was wrinkled, the muscles rotted, and the needle-shaped red awns jumped out of the eyes, turning to the Lord of Hell, Mardi Moss. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vitality of the detachment gathered in the sky, condensed into filthy clouds, black lightning in it, and the gray raindrops drizzle to the Lord of Hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Congers’ half-face seems to overlap with the projection of the nine-layered hell, a prisoner’s soul climbs up, and a dead giant throws Boulders, one evil beast commanding the Undead Legion, dozens of stinking bone dragons flying in the sky, countless "shadows" wandering between the illusion and the real, making it difficult to defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead Scourge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no legends among these undead, but they are less and more, and in the case of the Lord of Hells being entangled by Congos, they can hurt him as much. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the Heaven Mountain projection to distort the space, the projection of the Lord of the Inferior Mardi Moss has reached the level of the Arcanist, close to the legendary peak, Kang Gus did not dare to have any idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made Lucien and Natasha quite shocked. Before Congos was too big, he had to deal with two children who were only six, seven and seven. At least 10% of the ability has not been played. If he has treated it with such attitude from the beginning, even if Lu Xi'an is full of enthusiasm, Natasha will be brave and firm, and at most he can go to him once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mardi Moss burned a sulphur-like flame, blocking the filthy rain, and he whispered:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life kills and wins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰砰砰, a dead spirit bursts directly, like a flower A burst of fireworks, Congers suddenly appeared eleven silver balls around, they also expanded and exploded, until the last two stabilized, blocking Maldives' "killing and killing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Congers’s “Death and Natural Disasters” are all gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins, Natasha barely supported the insertion of pale justice in front of her, blocking the life rituals and the invasion of life and death, and the sword trembled fiercely. The creaking sound exudes a sacred and firm color, guarding a narrow range around it, and it seems to break at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Hell Lord Mardi Moss and the demigod Lich Congers, Lucien and Natasha, who have no fighting power, are not worthy of attention at all. The rest of the waves they can fight will kill the two. If there is no pale justice, this is a long sword that is equivalent to the legendary weapon of the devil and the devil. Lucien and Natasha are really as they expected. The same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the demigod Lich Congers, if Lucien regains his mental power and can use the ring again, then he doesn't mind the temporary Joining Lu Xien, fighting against the Lord of Hell, there is no eternal friend, no eternal enemy, only eternal interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death Lamentation." Congers's mantra is like an ethereal and illusory song, so that the sulphur flame on Mardi Moss seems to have reached the end of life and is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pale justice" made a sigh of sorrow, blocking the death mourning songs, seems to be unable to support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien indicated that Natasha was ready to pull up the sword and flee, and he used the power of Silver Moon Etna to send out the same blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the silvery white light in Lu Xien’s left hand suddenly swells up, not in a hurry, between the three and the next, the mysterious existence of the dead spirit The residual debris is swallowed and digested clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed, such an elegant and calm posture, such an incredible result, let Lucien stunned, the mind seems to have light shining, scatter all Darkness, the details that are not noticed are clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it so coincidental that each time the mysterious world is out of control...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why After the injury, in the preparation of the medicine, when he wrote the thesis, he did not appear to be out of control...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Etna so cautious, killing the underworld masters are趁 No one found the opportunity to start, but when he was facing Ashin, he could not control the “appetite”. He was not a false god influenced by the name of God...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pushing forward and killing the "Lord of Silver White", according to Rhein, he summoned Etna and used his power...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say what seven days to absorb and digest, it’s all deceptive, deceptive...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly shocked, Lucien only feels inside the left hand The power is changing rapidly, and the essence is getting higher and higher. Then, this force is rushed into Lucien's body, so that his soul and spiritual strength will climb, just like those with a projection or summoning Like the magician liter power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Aitna’s crisp and sweet voice sounded in the soul of Lucien: “Your 'Great Ivan’ magic is more suitable than my strength. Let's use it for big meals and gimmicks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it's not complete." Lucien didn't have time to ask Etna before and after, just stunned There is still a long way to go to express fusion magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, Aitna did not speak, and the more powerful and essentially higher power poured into the soul and body of Lucien, and all the senses around him Variety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is now in the sky, the material world next to it has faded away from all external concepts and becomes like its own cognitive world. The electrons make a transition in orbit. From time to time, they receive and emit photons. Protons and neutrons form a nucleus under strong force. A little bit of light is deep and cold, giving off a quiet and flowing taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extending a mentally hand, Lucien found himself able to directly "escape" them, and suddenly shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucien quickly returned to understand that this time is not an opportunity to experience this level of feeling, the knowledge about fusion, industrial principles, etc. Think back, projecting into different spell construction models. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time around seems to be very slow, plus the main core of fusion, the principle of this aspect of the soul library has a full introduction, Lu Xien in front of There is a magical structure that is relatively simple and has no other auxiliary models. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at it, releasing it." Aitna’s voice sounded, still a serious feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked: "No launch, no increase, nothing, will die together!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will handle it and hurry up." Aitna made a guarantee that the "cognitive starry sky" around it faded away, and the material world emerged. The Lord of Hell, Mardi Moss, is still The semi-god Lich Congos fights, "Pale Justice" and Natasha are still supporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a deep breath and seemed to have the feeling of directly penetrating inside the material, so his left hand extended, silver and white, painted in the air The inexplicable trajectory seems to be swaying through the particles, squinting the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
