Lucien is quite satisfied with this title, and predicts that the effect of deviation will be very good, sometimes, the beginning of the deviation The final development is the gap between heaven and the abyss. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether such a change in the fate of the main star can be copied and promoted, whether it is only known about the black hole's general knowledge, can imaginary simulation of the main process of its formation, and then borrow the help of the ritual Can you become a secret to fate? Or do you need to have two souls in your body like yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands that these questions that come out of his heart can only be explored at present, and the answer cannot be found. The only certainty is that if the earth is to be On the observation of the accumulation of changes around the black hole to understand its condition, the knowledge applied to the stellar system predicts magic, and it is very likely to determine the fate of the fate of the "destiny of no trace"! If you refer to the knowledge of "gravitational lens", the deviation caused by your own fate will be corrected to a considerable extent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the two sides of the knowledge developed from the general theory of relativity, the related books in the soul library are still in the state of seal, Lucian wants to rely on a little weak Impress yourself to research and deduct, I don't know how long it will take to find directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at Lucien carefully: "You become a high-ranking, and the fate of the main character has changed. The safe surname of going out is greatly improved, but at any time. Can't care, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, teacher, I will be careful." Lucien felt the faint care of Fernando's harsh tone. Smile nodded and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando licked his mouth and took a badge from his arms: "This is your ice and snow medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice and Snow Medal?" Lucien looked at this beautiful and unusual badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made of silver-white metal with a lot of transparent ice crystals on it, which forms a six-pointed star pattern, which looks like a magnified crystal snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the gap of this snowflake, use a smaller ice crystal to spell a word "氦", next to the number with a "1". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite once again sees the water flowing out, and the brain temporarily loses its ability to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando used his eyes to signal out the soup, and then simply explained: "Helen increased the air pressure according to your paper, and the liquid helium condensed into a solid. This is the first time that the theory has clearly entered the absolute zero degree in magic. It is a big step forward in the research of ultra-low temperature in the field of ice and snow magic, so you have no doubt that you have won the Ice and Snow Medal."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, this is not the point. The point is, is this paper not confidential?" Lucien knows the meaning of the number "1", but he is strangely wondering how to give himself a piece of it. Ice and Snow Medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando slammed his face and said: "You go out to take risks, time is not fixed, the danger is unknown, what is the meaning of secrecy? Even if it is open now, this extreme cold ray magic Spreading out has no effect on you. Is your adventure in the city of Allinge? If so, isn't it more helpful to change it for a good magic item?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A few consecutive blame, let Lucien a bit stunned and rubbed his back. These days, he concentrated on analyzing magic and mastering magic, but he did not expect it to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Fernando’s tone eased a little bit: “I only revealed it to Helen for the time being. She agreed with my request and made a snow and ice medal for you. Wait until your paper is published and then award the award ceremony. At least you have the highest honor in three different fields before the high-level magician. It is worth recording in the history of the magical parliament. This magician plus you only have five If it is not the song of the Silver Moon League, the "electronic" decoration is dumb, you will be the only person who has won the highest honor in four different fields before the high level. Of course, compared to your teacher, you It’s still a lot worse.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is used to surname his own students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, have you received the highest honors in several different fields before the high-level?" Lucien asked curiously, and some of his heart was moved, Fernando actually for himself. Things to find "ice witch" Helen? Paris negotiated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have now been reissued with the Holm Crown, the Ice and Snow Medal, the Silvermoon Medal, the Arcane Scepter, and the Witch's Laurel. The only immortal Throne Award is the same, and it is the most of all the Arcanists and legendary magicians. You want to overtake me, you can only get six." Fernando is proud of his rare arcanists who are good at many factions and fields. Even the power of illusion is only better than the king of nightmare and the curse of the eye. The legendary magician in the illusion field is almost a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Lucian answered, he lost the Ice and Snow Medal: "I don't like to give him a bunch of powerful magic items when the students go out. The mastery and application of magic is harmful, but this ice and snow medal is what you deserve, so it is not here. Hold it, it is Helen’s nine-day time to refine himself, the ability is better than Morris’s little guy’s Holm. The crown ring is much stronger, and I am too lazy to go to him to talk about your fourth ring. Anyway, Hathaway and Davy are not there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Lucien catching the medal, Fernando turned his head and turned: "After a few more days, the high-altitude flight is completed and then set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher flight is a flight The advanced magic of the technique, the basic structure is similar, the analysis is quite simple, the difficulty lies in the construction process, so no one will choose it when it is promoted, but once it becomes a high-level magician, this difficulty is no longer difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you watched Fernando leave, Lucien put his spirit into the Ice and Snow Medal, and suddenly felt a harsh cold, as if it could hurt the deep cold of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the shackles, carefully leaving a spiritual mark, Lucien finally grasped the Ice and Snow Medal, the horrible cold no longer penetrates into the soul, but Come to an unprecedented lucidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice and Snow Medal '氦', a seven-level perfect order item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold makes people Be alert, keep people calm and not be shaken by desires, so after wearing this medal symbolizing the honor of ice and snow, the resistance to illusion and soul control spells will be raised to the standard seven-ring snow witch."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honour is the aura that hangs over the head, and the 'Frost World' is the aura of strength. Once excited, the wearer will form a world of ice and snow with a radius of 500 meters. Low Any creature with a medium-strength strength will freeze the death as long as it is not immune to cold; creatures below the middle level and below the high level will suffer severe cold damage, and the action becomes extremely slow; the creatures above the high level and below the legend, If there is no corresponding spell and bloodline protection, every second will be hurt and weakened by the cold, and the action will be slow, and the slow effect will accumulate over time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Frost Circle, again Frost Aura (Seven Rings Ice and Snow Magic), can be maintained for three minutes in full range, and can be maintained for up to fifteen minutes if it is reduced to a few meters around. It can be used three times a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The strange 'cold' of Silent Hell can freeze the soul, and the seven-ring magic 'silent hail' that mimics it can be the same. It seems that the cold rays that can penetrate the soul can be used three times a day, but remember, it The temperature is not low, and the damage to the flesh is limited. When the Knights are prepared, it is difficult to penetrate the flesh and cannot freeze the soul. At the same time, due to the special surname, you can ignore most of the defensive magic."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The approximation of absolute zero is the lifelong pursuit of every ice magician, although there are several legendary magics that allow us to feel the cold near absolute zero before the theory is formed. , but we don’t know their principles. It’s not clear why this kind of cold can be achieved. It’s very difficult to learn. It can only be constructed by forcing a change in the cognitive world during promotion. I can't learn more anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to Lucien Evans, his newly discovered suffocating and newly constructed ice and snow magic, let us The completely grasped range of ultra-low temperature approximation to absolute zero is a huge breakthrough in ice and snow magic, opening a new page in the history of ice and snow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In October 819, I would like to thank Lucien Evans for his outstanding contribution to the field of ice and snow magic in the heat faction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The significance and dream of the Ice and Snow Master's life is absolutely zero. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Helen? "Paris"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough than the Holm crown ring..." Lucian swallowed a little excited, although there was only a constant effect, There are two five-ring magics, two constant, but a seven-ring magic level aura, a seven-ring magic, is enough to make people completely forget the other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
