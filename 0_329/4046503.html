			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solna Valley, in the city of Husum, is full of soldiers who search for "the resurrection, the rich and the god of salvation" evangelists and believers, making the whole city 喧哗Noisy, even at night did not calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the search for the action has basically no real surviving, and the current believer of El was originally the secret believer of the "flame and redeeming god" who was pursued. Come, they have long been accustomed to hiding their identity and the way they are in the crowd. They will not leave an impression on the sheriffs and soldiers. At this time, unless the priests of the gods such as the war master can be as many as the church of truth, they can use one god. Surgery, otherwise you want to find them by the search of the name of the assault, it is difficult to go to heaven. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for listening to theological debates, witnessing El’s deprivation of the name of the god of the moon, the “small killings” of the shallow believers who appeared in the underworld, found it useless, they and The preachers, priests, etc. have no connection at the moment and can only be included in the scope of surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send these letters to those places, and then follow the instructions in the letter. This is half the payment in advance, waiting for my friend. Seeing the mark, finding you, will pay you the remaining half of the reward." Ramiro, who changed his appearance again, stood on the street and told a trader who knew the journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dealer is busy nodding, taking over the splendid "bright" gold coins and several letters, but this half-pay is far more than the ordinary delivery The rewards made him completely unable to refuse, and there is another half of the reward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, he was very anxious, it almost arrived at the net profit earned by the merchants once, really a rich man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro scolded the hidden nine-ring master and the gold knight in the rank of war, decided to contact the three high-ranking vigils who entered the Eldo Peninsula People, as well as five high-ranking clerics, two gold-level knights, and six-day knights who investigated the meteorites three years ago in the mountains and countries of the northern Eldodo, let them separate their hands and help. The things here are a bit odd! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of the inexplicable suppression of this heterogeneous space, the church has only deployed transmission arrays in several countries that are fully controlled, and has not considered remote areas, so it cannot They can only use the original contact method for remote communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the cardinal group members who are leading the investigation of nearby peninsulas, mountains, and countries, and the leader of the monk, Valen Hill, there is no need for it. There is no clue at all, but according to the magical parliament Grand Master and the mysterious character of Francis, the emphasis is on the level, and there are countless strange events in the surrounding circles and tribes. If you encounter one, you will be cardinal. The members of the bishops will ask for help. They will be very angry. They will take their own actions. What are they going to investigate and do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, more than three years ago, there were meteor showers and small meteorites falling in many places in this heterodyne space. Where did the mysterious existence of Na and the Necromancers fall? Perhaps it was caused by them? Well, I have to find a chance to mix into the pseudo-god church that robs the god of the moon.” Ramiro shook his head and prepared Turning away - I don't know why, the heterogeneous space of human beings, such as human beings, is similar to the main material world in terms of day and night and one-year span, regardless of their size. Other heterogeneous spaces that are not suitable for human survival are in contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the discussion of the low pressure of several civilians was introduced to Ramiro’s keen ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the Lord of the Underworld was really killed by the great Redeemer, and quietly told you that the stone statues in His Temple suddenly split from it, most of them. The priests no longer have the power of the gods, and only a few can barely use them." A civilian who worked near the temple whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? I remember that the great god of salvation was simply saying two words!" The civilians could not understand Cuban Boolean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he is really the supreme god of salvation, as in the description, waiting for this search, I..." The civilian will be in his heart When the words are pressed, who knows if the companion next to them will go to inform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if it’s so great, it won’t let the moon god Asin escape. He is now re-entering the gods and becoming the embodiment of love and beauty. With the twilight star, the power of the priests is re-given in the temple." The sun and the believer of the god of justice, Belo, said dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the false gods can really change the priesthood and status by absorbing the surname of the gods. It is no wonder that they will be influenced by the surname of the gods, the surnames will be extreme, become slaves of desire, and the ability to think will decline. Ramiro thinks about the evaluation of the pseudo-god inside the church. While noticing a bit of anomalies, when these civilians discussed things, one of them was absent-minded, left and right, and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When such a big thing happened, he didn't even have the desire to discuss. Is it a believer who dominates the underworld? No, if it is really a believer, even if it is not I will be sad and angry, and I should be confused and lost. It is impossible to look around with vigilance as it is now, there is a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this young and short The back of the man, Ramiro quietly followed behind him, as a night watchman who often sneaked into the body secrets. He has a fairly high level of judgment on emotional reactions and psychological conditions, and is very sensitive to small anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an ordinary poor mud house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short Ris confirmed that no one followed, and got into the house, and the rest of the rest, An Hughes said: "Respected passers, great The God of Redemption and several preachers have left safely, and the blockade at the gates has also been relaxed. I have heard other news..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Hughes I used to stay in the city as an unexpected accident in the action. Therefore, after El, Francis, etc. left, due to strict search and arrest, I had to stay here and hide here. I would like to find the opportunity to leave by sending insults and instigators to inquire about the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to Rees’s information, Anthony painted the cross mark proposed by Francis on the chest: “My master can nowhere else, the underworld dominates the attempt to betray the true God. Naturally, you will be punished. Well, you will leave first, and things will calm down. I will spread the gospel of the great God of Redemption to you, restore His name to Him, and return to the highest and give."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only god of redemption." Reese also painted the cross and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing him away, An Hughes quickly closed the door, took out the items, and began to disguise. Suddenly, he felt his shoulders patted gently. A low smile came from the side: "I also want to hear the gospel of the great redeemer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver moon is overhanging, it is already in the dead of night, Lu Xien is waiting for An Hughes at the confined riverside shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lucien saw a figure sneaking around, then removed the disguise, revealing the face of An Hughes: " Leviathan, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the breath of An Hughes, Lucien came out from the hidden place: "So late? The blockade in the city is very "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." An Hughes didn't have much to say, but smiled and asked, "Leviathan, you made this big this time. Dedication, the great El God should have given you the name of the spiritual name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly confused, how to ask this question at this time: "Yes The great El God gave me and Francis's surname, which promoted Jacob's strength, An Hughes, and you can rest assured that you will receive a similar reward after returning to Bethalhem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, how powerful, what effect, did not reach the level of Jacob?" An Hughes behaved like an old guy with a slightly new disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands this very well and smiles: "It’s just a kind of spiritual surname that strengthens strength, speed, agility and resilience, with my natural strength. Can compete with ordinary heroes of blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good." An Hughes showed a hint of uncontrollable joy, seems to be "Leviathan "The species of the spiritual surname is only happy to this extent. "Well, let's go quickly, leave the valley early and feel at ease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart is also The same joy, because he is "physical control" Ramiro! An Hughes has died after he absorbed shallow memory and body cells! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I really got the blessing of the Lord, simply tracking an abnormal behavior, I found the disciple of the false god El, can smoothly merge into the top of the church, Find the reason why they snatched the name of the god of the moon, find the eccentricity of Francis, and wait for the disciple's 'species of the spiritual family'. Some of the magical techniques I can't simulate through the blood of the flesh, it is easy to expose the flaws, let me Encountering this 'species of spiritual surnames' is only the seventh disciple of the flesh, Leviathan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
