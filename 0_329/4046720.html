			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a stack of photos containing five victims, some of which are well preserved, some have rotted, and Buck is next to Heidi: “Three days ago, due to the damage of the magical array in the 'Claire' alchemy workshop, some night shift alchemists left early and returned to the 'Sardini' area through the 'Egret' area, they heard the first photo victim The screams of the people were led by a master of magic apprenticeship. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the murderers found them in advance, only the scene The body and footprints were wiped out by the cruel and calm mob. Later, we found four hidden bodies in the nearby remote areas, sewers, etc., and the internal organs disappeared without any clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi gently daggers: "From the perspective of rot, the initial time of this serial murder may be earlier than we think, and the number of deaths is also affirmed." More than we think, but why is it just hiding? Buried, not trying to destroy the body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s troublesome to completely and unobtrusively ruin the body, the river near Rentat There is no piranha, unless it is moved into the **.” Buck is judged by the fact that the murderer’s magic or knight’s strength is not strong. This is a more common reasoning. If the murderer has a strong strength, it must have strength. Why do you have to match the status of the poor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked at these photos over and over and asked: "Can there be an investigation of missing people in recent months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck’s face is bitter: "The Egret is a slum, full of people looking for opportunities from all over the Kingdom, and even the gangsters in the slums are getting It’s not clear who is missing and who is leaving...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi put down the photo: “Take me to see the body and the scene, it’s hard to explain the black and white photos. The problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an inexplicable sense of homicide in this visceral removal, and it is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck is thinking about how to suggest Heidi to go to the morgue and the slum area. When she heard her request, she naturally breathed a sigh of relief and quickly got up and said: "Ms. Please, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he walked quickly to his police car, he opened the door next to him and waited for Heidi to board the car. Only after a round of enthusiasm into the driver's seat, twisting the key, let this steel monster make a roaring low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The size of the car has finally shrunk..." Heidi looked at the comfortable environment and sent a heartfelt feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck laughed and said: "If it is as big as before, there is no way to drive on the street, thanks to the magician who simplified the alchemy matrix and materials. Required that new energy was found to partially replace the magic steam engine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the condition of most of the streets of Rentat, only one original Alchemy car can be driven. In addition, even the carriage is difficult to pass. After the improvement, most of the streets can be paralleled by two cars and do not occupy the sidewalk. Of course, the price of this alchemy car is also very expensive. Only the big nobility and some kingdom departments are equipped. Yes, Buck’s real power figure in the police department is not eligible for the car if he is receiving Heidi today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi touched the metal door and felt the cold texture: "If it were not for Lei Yiya, Katrina, they contributed to the synthesis of materials." The requirements of the alchemy matrix are so easy to reduce..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very aware of the difficulty of simplifying these things, but fortunately, thanks to the new alchemy in recent years The guidance, elements and alchemy fields have been greatly developed, and there are many breakthroughs in material synthesis and refining. There are not only atomic research institutes such as Lei Yi Li Ya, Katrina, Lazar, Rock and so on. The contributions of the masters, as well as the efforts of thousands of magicians such as Larry, Ulysses, Timothy, and K. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of materials is perhaps the place where countless experimental accumulations are needed. In addition to using prophetic techniques to eliminate many wrong paths, there is no luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design concept of the steam civilization era brought by the dwarves also gave the magicians the inspiration to simplify the alchemy car, and the purification produced a high-energy burning At the same time, they are also looking for new energy alternatives, such as solar energy stored in the energy pool like a magic tower, such as other combustibles containing more energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the earth-shaking changes in the Magic Council and the Four Kingdoms, Heidi couldn't help but feel a little excited and excited about living in such an era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I don't have Annick, Sprint's talent in the micro-field, and there is no such thing as Katrina or Reyia. Sensitive and patient, but I believe that I will be able to make breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence and get the Holm Crown Award..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi holds the fist Encourage yourself, think of the ability to deal with most problems with alchemy items without soul participation, and even surpass most of the arcane masters in some respects. What happens when you think about integrating soul fragments into such alchemy items later? Wonderful changes, she will inevitably be excited, and among the six teachers, only myself and Cherie have not won the highest honor in a certain field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck opened an alchemy car and focused on the road without squinting. Very cautiously: "Ms. Let's go to the morgue of the 'Violet' hospital. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Heidi has no opinions, and would like to visit the hospital system jointly run by the Kingdom and the Magic Council. This initially made the general public understand that not only the truth. The gods can heal, and the magic council can! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck did not dare to neglect the guests, so he was always looking for the topic: "Alchemy cars are not fast enough, and the future direction should no longer be to reduce the volume, but It is enhanced to launch magical arrays and energy. I saw from the "Arcane and Magical Herald" that the three masters of storm dominance, atomic control, and elemental dominance have completed the initial theory of elemental decay, and will be able to decay in the future. To drive the alchemy car?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nuclear power..." Heidi’s surname has always been lively and can’t help but laugh. Buck is a typical newspaper. After that, I only know a few nouns, and the research on the direction of nuclear power is the main research project of the Institute of Atomic Research. The teacher personally leads, and Jerome, Lazar, Mr. Rock and others are rotating and matching. The most cutting-edge and most horrible energy source is probably not available to most high-level magicians, let alone alchemy cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few laughs, she deliberately ridiculed: "When we have completed the miniaturization and civilization of magnetically constrained nuclear fusion alchemy equipment, we should It will make the speed of the alchemy car very fast..." It will fly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnetic Constraint Controlled Nuclear Fusion is the final goal of the teacher's research project, and is the ultimate energy source for the city of Aringe. Far away and far away, I don't know how long it will take decades to see the dawn. After all, even the decaying nuclear energy is still looking for a smooth use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magnetic Constraint Controllable Nuclear Fusion Alchemy..." Buck repeatedly "chews" this long but seemingly mysterious and cool phrase, and can go back later The earthquake is shocked by relatives and relatives. This is the real frontier of the real arcane. It is not the outdated things in the guide. This is what the Atomic Institute Ms. Heidi said personally! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a beautifully-looking white building appeared in the eyes of two people. Buck stepped on the pedal and stopped the alchemy car at the door of the "Violet" hospital. Then quickly get off the bus, go to the other side, and open the door with the attitude of a standard gentleman: "Ms., come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi got off the bus and looked at the hospital Gently nodded, tidy than the imagination, faint sacred feeling, the dead spirits guys have such a side? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the glass door, Buck took Heidi to the morgue, and along the way met doctors and nurses wearing white coats, they are The specially selected medical dementors are the magic apprentices and the middle and lower level magicians. This hospital is not only the place where they treat patients to help the wounds, but also the experimental place to verify certain ideas and magic. Therefore, this selection There is no compulsion, but many magicians are eager to sign up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, experiments that are not allowed will be severely punished by the Ministry of Correction of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current "Violet" hospital has been running for one year. Because magical medicines, alchemy equipment, etc. are all produced by themselves and by the parliament, the price is relatively cheap, and the reputation is naturally Very good, and the doctors and nurses were also taken by the people of Rentat to a nondescript name "Magic Angel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, there was a noisy voice in front, many nurses and doctors were asking around a tall, black man, attitude Very excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
