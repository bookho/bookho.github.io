			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pair of evil eyes on this "gate", the eyes are bloody yellow, the pupils are red and dense, and they are stunned, even if they are separated. The magical field, the magicians, knights and ordinary people looking up on the ground also have the feeling of confusion, a little can not control the spirit of madness, the desire to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the left arm of the Mardi Moss is not as fast as it used to be, but it is still broken, but the chaotic and bloody "gate" is forming It is quite slow. Of course, the so-called slowness is just the speed of the former Wicken fusion of "Ancient Hell" and "Paradise Mountain". In fact, it is only a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these few seconds, the two "universe" projections with the azure planet and the foggy planet, respectively, slowly and resolutely crossed the middle line, their edges are mutually Overlapping, but not disturbing each other, even the two asteroids that seem to be hitting each other, directly through each other, flying far away, they seem to be within easy reach, but it seems to be far away, unable to touch, Can't get close, even if you pass by, don't know the other's existence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the edges of the two "starry sky" begin to overlap, the "Lusien" soul with the characteristics of the summer wind and the like The soul of En, the back is getting closer and closer, miraculously began to merge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just two independent people who hug each other in front of the starry sky, now they are the one-piece baby sharing the back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no dazzling light, no loud sounds, no other unimaginable anomalies, and the two "Lusian" begin to blend together little by little. In a strange and quirky way, it seems that each time they merge, the kind of transcendental things do not belong to this world, and the feelings above this world become clearer and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost souls of the "Ancient Hell" and the ancient devils, somehow, suddenly shivered, even if they had no physical form, "negative emotions "Wrapped up, but also to all the witnesses of this scene of the wisdom of life trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, green, dark, red, colorful light began to sway silently, lost souls began to disintegrate, ancient devils began to disintegrate, And to the outside exudes only the "negative emotions" and the ancient devil can sense the majestic suction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Queen Agleia is pulling out the "natural punishment bow", the body suddenly becomes blurred, and a black shadow inside is distorted, as if to want to drill out Follow the invisible suction and blend into the "eternal hell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Agleia to stop the action of pulling the bow and archery, half-incorporating the body into the shadow of the elf tree behind it, through which it "spreads the roots ", the black shadow is firmly tied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of the Sky", the thirty-fourth floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength of Brooke at this time is higher than that of "Mermos", there is also the help of "The Hand of the Era" Oliver and the "Prophet" Begner. However, in order to protect the Magic Tower and Allinge from being destroyed, the Arcane Surroundors are not affected. He has to divide most of his power and attention to dissolve the aftermath and control the scene. For a time, three legends The magician’s battle with the “Devil” Melmos was hard to resolve, and Brooke’s study was razed to the ground, destroying most of the rooms in this magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dark and deep magnetic field twisted around, the silver-horrible electric snake formed a cage, and the battle of the legendary peak must have destroyed the magic tower and destroyed it. A little half of Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if Bruker is hard to support, he is not in a hurry, because he knows very well that the projection of Melmos is not sustainable. Just be careful to avoid him causing chaos. The real key is the battle of the gods and legends in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Melmos, who drives the dawn force to shine through the stars, is standing in the same place, with dark shadows in the body. The negative light erupted, flew toward the sky, and flew toward the ancient hell. Under the "old hell" change caused by Lucien, there was no body or "sacred avenger" sword to help him resist this. Suction from instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook, Oliver, and Begner are innocent and distracted. It’s not clear what happened in midair, but the changes in Melmos are not enough to capture them. Living in this opportunity, the "electromagnetic kingdom" of Brooke's projection suddenly shrank, and Mermoth was bound inside, and Oliver and Bergner each used legendary spells to "mush" Melmos into the electromagnetic kingdom. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to solve him, you control the lock of Ariel." Brooke said through the connection of the soul, followed by the "electromagnetic kingdom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this level of control hub is completely damaged, but this is only part of it, on the 33rd floor of Fernando, Helen, Hathaway and other Arcanists In the study room, there are still other control hubs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver did not hesitate, with the help of Taling Prosper, entered the study that Fernan did not close, and controlled the lock of Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, they have a look at the air, carefully watching the battle, ready to join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien is in the impact of the gods..." Oliver frowned slightly. "It can be completely different from the speaker, not half of the cognitive world." The destiny of the stars, but the 'real starry sky' versus the 'realistic starry sky'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devils may think that this is the difference in the cognitive world, but the legend of Oliver The magician is keenly aware that these two impacts are different in nature. In the process of Lucien's impact, the "atomic universe" is only a medium, a primer, and it is not an important part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begner is puzzled: "Based on the observer effect? ​​Real-world feedback may be an observer effect?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Oliver hesitated. "No matter what, if he can be promoted successfully, Viken will be able to break through."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart, Nexel Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver ash sword with a vain gap broke through the heavy defenses around Atlante and reached his body, but his mouth was Showing a strange smile, the body suddenly collapsed, like a mirror broken, like the water reflected on the figure was put into a huge stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And phantom? Natasha, who held the "Sword of Truth" in both hands, changed slightly and flashed to the side, but at this time, the sound of a simple vicissitudes sounded just right:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Visual Deprivation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s body suddenly hit like a hammer, the bow was bent, and the corner of his eye was overflowing with blood. It was hard to control herself. However, her silver-purple eyes lost her look. It seems that she can no longer see the things in front of me in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante, transformed into the ancient devil state, truly embodies what is said to be awkward and difficult to prevent, and since the beginning of the battle, Natasha’s sword of truth has been in the middle of it. He was seventeen times, but ten of them were phantoms, and seven times were outside a noble or knight to replace him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the help of Morris’s defensive array, Natasha couldn’t tell if Atlante was true or not, so he’s attacked with full force. Atlante's "perceptual deprivation" spells deprive the senses bit by bit, losing sight, touch, smell and vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both eyes closed, Natasha used the field of will to sense the surroundings with intuition. Suddenly, she once again took out a sword, and the silver-gray sword was cold and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tearing voice is silent, and Atlante’s figure is highlighted and is stunned by Jianguang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, this figure is still broken like a mirror, without a real feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perceptual deprivation!" Atlante’s voice came from all directions, and Natasha’s whole person was grayed out, as if there was only one in the world. People stand in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her appearance, there was a figure of Atlante with his eyes closed. He smiled slightly: "I said that you can't help." Blocking me, I will take your life to the Allinge Magic Tower in exchange for the people inside to open the transmission array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this willpower and strength Almost the epic knight, Atlante's "perceptual deprivation" can't directly strip away the five senses and intuition, only step by step and step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, all the phantoms are broken, and a colorful, distorted figure emerges, and it breaks down under the illusory gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, how do you find it?" Atlante dying and struggling, the tone is strongly unbelievable, the five senses, the will field and the intuition exist Natasha can't find herself. What can she do now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, a unique "silver" necklace appeared in the hands of Natasha, giving a crisp metal crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante, although he doesn’t know the item, can recognize its role. It can at least help Natasha to attack several illusion attacks. Just now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." His body is on the verge of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to have heard his inner doubts, and the glory of the eyes gradually recovers, smirking: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deliberately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a legendary item specially made by Lucien using materials from the Holm Kingdom treasure house, but It can't help me find you, so I deliberately deprived you of five senses and intuition, because my eyes will deceive me, my ears will deceive me, my instinct will also deceive me... only rule out their interference, Use the 'mind' to sense and find, in order to truly 'see' into the world, 'look' to you who are hiding in the dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, A long time ago, I was practicing quietly, that is, silent practice without five senses and intuition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She changed the famous saying of Lu Xien, let Atlante understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the huge suction from "Ancient Hell" came, and the negative emotions in Atlante flew out, which made him almost smashed. It became clear again, coughed hard, and regretted and said with emotion: "Why, why not early, then I will not be controlled by Viken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha stepped forward, the boots made a crisp sound on the ground, and the tone was solemn: "Although I don't want to say this to the dying person, I can't help but say that it is late to blame the change of ancient hell. A little bit, it is better to blame why my decision was a little earlier, why not wait until the Speaker of the House becomes a god of choice and choose the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlantis Long The sigh sighed and the body completely disintegrated and dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "Sword of Truth", he has no possibility of resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked up and looked at the changes in the sky with half-recovery vision. She smiled and said to herself: "Why don't you be earlier, then I will Don't be so risky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can actually hide into the "atomic universe" with the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, and Atlante simply won't fight Come in, but at this time, she consciously must be with the subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy and evil door opened and slammed With the hands and feet of different races, the meat balls with countless eyes rolled out, and the feelings of blood, killing and madness were completely diffused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "shocks" of the two "Lusien" came to an end, and the "body" under their heads was completely integrated. Together, only two faces are still facing their respective "starry sky". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two "Lusien" suddenly showed painful expressions, each looking back again, beginning the final fusion, with the azure planet and the foggy planet The two stars seem to no longer overlap as they have just been, and they are giggling strange noises! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcano inside the hell is erupting at the same time. Every devil feels that the void around him is shaking, shaking, making a giggling sound, as if The whole world is about to be broken, as if there is another huge universe in the place that you can't see it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
