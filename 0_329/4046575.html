Don't be beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are slightly picked up, even if there is no active exile, but the accumulation of epic knights for hundreds of years still makes him full of pressure, let the side protect the Na Tasha's Duke of James couldn't help but turn his eyes and avoid his gaze, but Natasha looked at him with a firm gaze, without any wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a dozen seconds, Ketonia’s voice was low and said: “Your Majesty’s treatment is very good, I agree that any dare to violate the basic order of the nobility. Everyone must be severely punished, but I hope that Her Majesty will let you personally solve York. I don't want him to be shameful on the gallows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s an understandable idea.” The expression on Natasha’s face was softer than that of a fierce sensation with a Knight of the same level. “And, I want to make the epic knight’s rotation ahead of time. After all, I have just been crowned and need to be familiar with both of you. I hope that you can transfer your Excellency to Winston as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia Understand that this is the condition of exchange, and he also knows this kind of thing. Natasha will certainly not trust herself in a short time. If she does not do this, he will doubt that she hides another conspiracy, so she nods. Road: "I escorted the Queen to you after returning to Nexus Palace with Wins Exchange, guarding a few territories of different space, will not disappoint the Queen's squatting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the epic hero of the creation of the kingdom, I am against you Full of confidence.” Natasha encouraged and comforted, “The matter of the Duke of York is handed over to you, and the specific heirs are up to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotney The left hand presses the chest and deeply swears: "Thanks to the trust of Her Majesty the Queen, I will escort you back to Nexel Palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the hand of time The "powerless kiss" of Camille and Russell was quickly lifted, and Ketonia also "smoothly" found evidence from "Pilimas", and then through the contrast of blood, it is a strong proof that he is The night watchman ranked fifth in the "cursed angel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Nexus Palace, Natasha told James and others: "Duke James, trouble you to ask the Duke of Sorenfen to come, and block the news, An hour later, the House of Lords meeting was held. Duke Russell, please guard against the escape of Count ElBaradei and check if York really died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Her Majesty. "The Duke of James and others answered with sincerity, a superior knight is always admirable, and Natasha was the only one who had the ability and the slightest hope to break the squad to escape, but she stayed behind and blocked it." enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexel Palace, in the House of Nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of ElBaradei’s face, Tie Qingdi, came in with the Duke of Russell, and in the face of a warm greeting from a noble member of the pro-church, they only gently decapitated Responding to the loss of the past graceful grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Russell, can you tell me why Her Majesty wants to recruit aristocrats? I remember that the month’s mourning period has not passed, is she going to ruin her promise? "The Count of ElBaradei has been smiling to the side like the Duke of Russell, a young blond artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Natasha will go to James’ private estate today, and that David and Gewell will do it, so when he hears Natasha wants to hang a nobleman In the parliament, the heart raised a bad hunch, but the Duke of Russell, the eight-level knight, went straight to the door and invited him halfway. He couldn’t do it if he wanted to evade himself or escape. Come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept telling himself that there would be nothing, he just made a hint, guided the resentment in David’s heart, and introduced Gwell to him. I have never directly taught him to assassinate the Queen's Majesty. It is impossible to become a murderer because two people who introduced him at a private banquet occasion will be charged with crimes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell sees the Duke of Rex shifting his eyes and seeing that his responsibilities have been fulfilled, smiling and leaving the Count of ElBaradei and returning to his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count ElBaradei shook his head: "I don't know, York?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Rex frowned: "Don't see, he is not Has it always arrived at the earliest? Is it that he has an accident? The anger of Lord Ketonia will burn everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is a meeting of the House of Lords, the Duke of York has always been Come early, first go to see the "heart of time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard that York had not come, Count Baradei’s face was even worse, but he also had a plan to save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was a temporary convening, many of the nobility members who were not in Lentart, who were not strong enough, did not have time to catch up, only about two-thirds of the staff Arrivals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction of Natasha has arrived at the door, Rex left the seat, walked to the half-height platform in front, picked up the raft, and rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crisp sound, the House Hall was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a queen to please." Rex turned and took a black cockle fluttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was wearing a black court dress, purple long hair casually holding, slowly coming in from the gate, followed by Camille and a team knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in the hall, the team of knights will be separated from each other, and the seats in this circular conference hall will be "guarded". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is a calm blond man, Count Baradei recognizes that this is the deputy head of the small knights brought by Queen Natasha from Aalto. Others have Aalto's Violet Knights, and some are loyal to the Queen's Sword of the Knights of the Truth, the ruling knight, the Holy Cross, and the Grand Knights are fifteen, and the Cavaliers are More than fifty people, plus Camille, is much stronger than a medium-sized knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats who don’t understand what happened are whispering, and this posture heralds the next unrest. At the same time, they were shocked. In less than a month, Her Majesty won the loyalty of so many great knights and knights, and reached into the top three. The Knights, and the Knights of the Sword of Truth, have always been exclusive to the royal family. They are also the most closely matched to Natasha during this time. The loyalty is more reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that she already has the basic strength to protect her throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Natasha knocked on the raft and made it as quiet as a hundred flies in the flying House Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she looked around the hall with a blank expression, "implicit anger" authentic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This morning, I suffered an assassination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The nobles boiled up, and the assassination of their lords was itself taboo, and it was still The Queen’s Majesty’s coronation took less than a month to happen, which is simply challenging the aristocratic order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex first stunned, thinking of the absence of York, thinking of ElBaradei’s gods not keeping their homes, thinking of the hints in their words, the heart suddenly ignited An angry, angry at the Count of ElBaradei, stupid idiot, I hope you do not even have plans to destroy the mouth! If you find evidence, go to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Count Baradei calmed down and turned a blind eye to the eyes of Duke Rex, figuring out how to minimize the crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha knocked on the raft again and said: "The assassination of me is the Countless Dave and the Night Watcher's fifth curse angel, this One point, the Duke of James, the Duke of Russell, and the Earl of Pine can testify. The identity of the "cursed angel", you can testify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall becomes again Quiet, the nobles couldn’t understand how the pro-magic parliament’s David would mix up with the night watchman, but they soon woke up and wanted to hurt people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night watchman dared to assassinate the Queen, and the church is getting too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Clamping? How many similar things have happened in the past, the church forgets the lesson every time they express their apologies, maybe our balance strategy is a mistake!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobles Angrily talking about it, similar to Natasha's expected reaction, this church can not recognize Ge Weier's identity, but who is called the Cardinal of Holm Parish is Sald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty, must severely punish this behavior, hang David, burn Gewell, and let the church compensate accordingly!" The church faction, or the pro-magic parliamentary faction, a noble member of parliament issued a similar view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded. "They will get a fair trial. The meeting was held today because of the confession of Earl David, who was also instructed. Instructed him to be the Count of ElBaradei, and the Duke of York was also involved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise stopped again, except for a few who had known it for a long time, the nobles Each face was shocked, the Duke of York and the Earl of ElBaradei were both great aristocrats, leaders of pro-churchists, and the great figures of the House. They were involved in this matter and would inevitably cause great shocks, and behind the Duke of York. It is the "heart of time". . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, they all look to the quiet seated ElBaradei, praying that there is no real thing, the kingdom can not afford civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex is an angry idiot with a look at ElBarade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of ElBaradei stood up slowly: "His Majesty, I deny the accusation against me, I have to face David. I have never taught or Implying that he stabbed you, his own bad thoughts after knowing Gewell are beyond my control. On this point, the Duke of York is innocent, you can ask him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tied himself to York, trying to minimize his crimes with the majesty of "The Heart of Time," and indeed did not leave evidence of instigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have sent people to ask the Duke of York." Natasha said calmly, let the Count of ElBaradei feel a little uneasy, and more urged the authentic: "Please invite the Queen Let David confront me in front of all the nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha waved, and a knight pressed against the shackled bracelet. Wei came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, ElBaradei, do you still want to deny? It is obvious that you are tempting me to go in the direction of resentment, obviously you and York teach me to assassinate Queen.” David was completely afraid of things and laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of ElBaradei smiled a little and was crazy. As long as he brought York deeper, his hopes of getting rid of his sin would be greater: "Please tell Everyone, how do we teach you and confuse you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave was stunned and couldn’t think of powerful words, so he made up according to the previous statement. A few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of ElBaradei is high: "His Majesty, he is lying, we have never said this, I asked the clergy to lie to him!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes he has not said anything that can be caught, he is very confident in himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Natasha with sincerity, Count ElBaradei said: "Please ask Her Majesty to repeat the process of detecting lies and obtaining testimony. I am against David. The fall of the frame is very angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a knight came in again outside the gate, and he said on his knees: "Her Majesty, the Duke of York is guilty of suicide. Here is his confession, against Pakistan. The Lord’s mastermind’s mastermind did a detailed confession.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the hall slammed, this is a change they had never thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? York committed suicide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the heart of time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he regret it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
