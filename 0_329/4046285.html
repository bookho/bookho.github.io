			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked like a real ghoul in the sky, whispering in his heart: "It is the cardinal of the northern church, Or is it a Southern church? Why did he appear in the realm of the dead? Hunting Nikonov?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason for the split between the Northern Church and the Southern Church is in the section The understanding of doctrines and prayers is especially questionable to the Pope’s “identity of the spokesperson of the god of truth”. Therefore, after they split, they changed the pope to the Pope and no longer enjoyed the lofty status of “the spokesperson of God”. The moderator and convener of the bishops then lead the church in the name of the entire cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of differences in these places, regardless of the clergy system such as "Principal Cardinal - Cardinal - Bishop - Pastor", or clothing style, title, cross shape In the above, the two churches in the north and the south are highly similar, and Lucien can't distinguish by the characteristics of the clothing - they follow the previous rules to prove their orthodox status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question just rose in the heart, Lucien laughed at himself with a sentence: "After being shocked, is the head confused? He is from the bottom of the mine The gap is definitely the cardinal of the Northern Church! There is only one person in the vicinity, the seven-level cardinal Nevsky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if a red cardinal of the Southern Church sneaked into the vicinity of the Ural City, it would not be possible to be so swaying in the Cardinal Robe. Heresy is more hateful than the pagans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this cardinal tracking Nikonov to discover the gaps in the dead world, or do you know it yourself? If it is the former, then there is nothing wrong with it. And if the latter, his relationship with Nikonov is intriguing, and the existence of the dead spirit is not the street cabbage, there will be so many people know. Right, the undead creature that flew past Is it related to them? What kind of undead is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of the dead world is as it is external, as if it is always covered In a layer of gray smog, I couldn’t see it clearly, and I was full of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the appearance of the cardinal, Lucien decided to wait and go out again, because he certainly would not stay here for a long time, he would return at any time, and he It is very likely that there are clever traps on the outside to judge whether or not they have been tracked. Now that the trade has left through the gap, it is very easy to expose its existence. In addition, if there are high-ranking powerhouses coming in, they are not slamming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patience is a good quality for most of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warly waving his arms, Lucien and other ghouls are stunned and sullen in the black and white gray wilderness, trying to "find" each The corpse that may exist, patiently waiting for the return of the cardinal. At the same time, Lucien looked through the books he had collected about the history of the church in the Soul Library, focusing on the things before and after the split between the North and the South. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, both the Southern Church and the Northern Church have tried their best to discredit each other, elevate themselves, and destroy all historical records that are not conducive to themselves. . They look at each other and are full of joy. For example, the Southern Church recorded that the Pope’s Gregory I was holy and merciful, pious and sincere, accused the first cardinal of the split church, the first Pope Ivan. Greed, physical and mental corruption, blinding the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Northern Church recorded that the Pope’s Saint Ivan was dedicated to the truth and dedicated to the Lord. In order to prevent the world from being blinded, he stood up. Out, it pierced the false face of the pope. At the same time, they accused Gregory I of the development of the truth to the peak. He was a false believer. He was stealing the glory of the Lord. He was the most purified god. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Magic Council, the "God of God" gloating to collect and preserve most of the destroyed historical records at the time, and with a "neutral" attitude to themselves The understanding recorded the whole process, but the information was plain and ordinary. Except for Lucien's understanding of the scandals of some church figures, it was impossible to interpret anything of value from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...On that day, the gods looked at the holy city, Ivan, Alexei, Uliel, Felix, four saints and Seven priests such as Souter, Allers, and Sirius were standing out under the golden light, accusing Gregorian of being the embodiment of the Lord of Hell..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading the "Spirit" of the highest theological conference recorded in the Northern Church, Lucien frowned and thought: "Isn't Mr. Rhein able to find some interesting things from the history of these churches? How can I No clue, no problems... Is it true that the personal black history of each other’s feeds is also calculated? Although they are really funny and funny, they are completely different from the meaning of 'fun” in Mr. Rhein’s context...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are no clues from the historical literature, Lucien, who has nothing to do and dare to meditate and analyze magic, still spends time watching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the sky flew back to the figure in the cardinal robe, he passed straight, did not try to purify the numerous undead creatures on the wasteland, quickly Leaving from the gap in the mine. Nikonov and the high-level undead have not appeared, as if they have completely disappeared into the boundless, ridiculously dead souls, and everything has returned to the eternal silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Consult the matter, or kill Nikonov?... If he is tracking Nikonov to find it, I have to hurry and leave." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the scene of the "Seven Ivan Biography" produced by the Northern Church, Lucien witnessed the scene, and quickly analyzed the possibilities, if the red The bishop did not know the realm of the dead, and did not understand the great significance of his representative. Then his next move would be easier to guess: he would certainly report to the northern church cardinal and block the mine to explore the dead world. Therefore, Lucien, who can't take risks, must leave before he sends a blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this matter can't be too urgent, you have to wait until the cardinal leaves the mine, the time difference must be well grasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gaps in the dead world must be discovered and entered in a specific way, otherwise only at a special time can anyone pass through, so this red Before the bishop knew that the Necromancers had the greatest relationship with Nikonov, I could not ignore the other possibilities and stayed here with great care..." Lucien silently counted the time and will Ivan Biography is closed and ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when the "Spirit of St. Ivan" was closed in the Soul Library, Lucien suddenly pointed to a sentence: "...So St. Ivan accepted Command, with a few cardinals to Wilfrid, to prepare to purify this extremely evil and horrible magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Like a flash of lightning across the road to Sean, illuminating the darkness, he made a strange idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilfried, isn't that the legendary Necromancer 'Pale Lord' who works with Maskillin and others?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Lucien learned from the notes of the Necromancer Hunter in the original Wilfrid territory. At the same time, Lucien, who has read many historical documents and books, is no stranger to Wilfrid. He has not disappeared like the five legendary magicians such as Muskilllin and Viken, but fell to the church. Under the covenant of several cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Wilfrid was unable to participate in the Musiglin organization’s secret team in the depths of the Necromancer for other reasons..." Lucy En thought, while quickly searching for the church records about the encirclement of Wilfrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s feel so excited and a little scared that most of the search results appearing are recorded by the Northern Church and the Magic Council, and the Southern Church is only roughly recorded. Such a thing, did not specifically mention the leader Ivan who led the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Ivan, Alexei, Nikon, Uriel, Gono, Felix Six Cardinals raiding Wilfrid The half-plane magic tower, after a fierce battle, killed it and destroyed his hidden life... Among them, Nikon was killed by Wilfrid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan, Alexei, Nikon, Ullil, Gono, Felix..." Lucien repeatedly recited these names in his heart and felt that he had touched a horror The secret, "Nikon was killed by Wilfrid, that Gono?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quickly opened the literature, Lucien saw about this The last record of the cardinal: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal of Conor was subjected to his mortal rebellion, death energy and soul while killing the evil magician Wilfried. The entanglement is difficult to separate, and after seven years it fell in the holy city of Lans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
