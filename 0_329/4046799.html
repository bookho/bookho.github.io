			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kswick, "Rose Square". !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the small crystal suddenly came and exudes the atmosphere of the top creatures, the crowd immediately burst into exclamation and screams, as if they were swept by the tide Retreat, panic and fear are almost consolidating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dragon, Dragon!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete, finished..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, terrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short moment, there is a large space around the curtain, although they know that this is the scene in the Great Theatre of the Kingdom of Lent, the subconscious fear comes from the instinctive reaction, and it is impossible to control. There is no "special effect" better than "real dragon"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the different sizes of cities such as Kukes, Salivar, Pefus, Samara, etc., similar situations have occurred, some fearing to retreat Some are completely sluggish, and some feel that they are dreaming. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from the heyday of the ancient magical empire, it is difficult for humans living in non-appropriate areas to see the dragon, but as the eternity of the poet in generations The villain’s impression of the dragon did not diminish with the passage of time and the death of the old and the sick. After the “Sound of Mystery” was launched, the “Human and Nature” program used several periods to introduce the legendary creatures that everyone is most interested in. It is not difficult for Banus and Ali to roughly recognize that this is a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing subconsciously, the legs can’t help but tremble, even though the distance is far away, Banus and Ali are still the dragon in the curtain. Full of fear, if they are not scared, they have already turned and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Ali woke up: "She is in the Kingdom Theatre, near the dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;How to do? How to do? Just as his panic fears are about to drive him crazy, the only opera actor on the stage, Princess Amantha, uses the recital with the characteristics of singing: "My most precious treasure is my courage and The Cavaliers believe that no one can take it, a sinister dragon, kill me, or be killed by me, there is no third choice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same mistakes are in the hearts of all those who have not yet understood what is going on, you are a opera actor, not a real knight! It is better to hand over to the "professionals" such a difficult task! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, is it?·····? Finally, Banus, Ali and others are a little bit fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the princess sang, the "unaffected" band was also playing, and the nervous, uneasy, hurried, tragic melody made everyone truly feel the same. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing the princess’s singer and opera singer, the heart is screaming in front of the dragon in front of him, because of the rehearsal and the little crystal deliberately converges on himself. Long Wei made her unaffected. She could barely control her body and voice without shaking, and continued to sing her own lyrics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this subconscious fear made her hormone secretion make her feel that she played the best level ever, and the following aristocrats tremble at the same time. Her feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, the band has not been affected by Longwei to continue playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the princess’s tragic and high-spirited aria that makes the body tremble, Banus and Ali shuddered, completely from the dragon The recovery brought about by the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""I actually asked a dragon to play the evil dragon of money?" Banus felt that this sentence seemed to be a problem, but it was secretly secreted. The hormones make him excited and excited now, and it is difficult to think calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali put down his inner worries and focused on the small crystal. After all, the chances of actually seeing the dragon are very rare. When the last time Her Majesty married, "Atom Controlling the scene of your arrival on the dragon, the scene was described by a poet. They all claimed that they had witnessed the grand occasion at the scene, so as to enjoy the envious eyes and the credibility of the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience next to it was excited: "It should not be an illusion, the Queen of the box, the prince of Evans and the magician are all legendary powerhouses. How can the general existence of the gods not see the illusion, so that they can only see 'Princess, one is singing, this is disrespect for them, so it must be the real dragon...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also affected by hormones, I can't stop at the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense, really a dragon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Kingdom and the Magic Council turned out to be Can make a dragon become a opera actor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazingly the small crystal on the stage answered the challenge of the princess, it leaned back, front The two claws lifted up and kept licking their chests, making an "angry" snoring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow! All the audiences whose strengths are below the high level are once again taken back by the majesty of the dragon and the "horror of the horror". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True!" Banus clenched his fists and said loudly, but the excitement in the voice was more than fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good horror, horror, ·····" The princess briefly patted her chest, a pair of scared appearance, but her eyes died Staring at the stage with sorrow, there was an unprecedented excitement in his eyes, mixed with the faint excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mostly similar looks around all the "live squares". Such operas are almost unheard of, too exciting and too exciting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali swallowed a sip: "'The princess, really strong, standing in front of the dragon is not intimidating, you look around those..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Women of the Valkyrie..." Banus looked at the "curtain" with a narrow eye and thoroughly understood the "meaning" of the Valkyrie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, Natasha looked at Lucian with a puzzled look: "Why is the movement and snoring of the little crystal a bit weird? What is the idea...········!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando also took a look at Lucien, how can I let the little crystal do this kind of action, make this kind of snoring What? It's a dragon, it's not something else... but this little guy is quite suitable for this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I designed several sets of movements and buzz, and Little Crystal picked this up. A set, it feels that this can best show its 'majesty,'. Lucien laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked her eyebrows and rubbed her chin: "From your laughter, I seem to understand a little, the rest of the movements and buzz It must be even more unbearable, and the small crystals naturally feel that this set is great.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "The result of the selection depends only on the design of the option. Oh, is this not good? Not suitable for small crystals? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Natasha also laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stage, the final battle of the princess’s knights has recovered from Longwei and rejoined her. I will follow her assault.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess’s expression is open to the throat with a strong expression, and a sweet and touching song directly hits everyone’s mind with the band.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of people will always recall the goodness of the past before they do something that is important to them, and they can recall it at a dangerous or dying moment. It’s definitely the most impressive pictures in life. The princess obviously remembered the prince before the charge, and remembered the love that had been sweet and painful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With her singing, most people who have had emotional experiences or longing for emotional experiences are immersed in this song. Ali looks at the "curtain" and imagines her in the heart, imagining the two A gap that cannot be crossed, for a moment he feels sweet and sad <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of a song is another period, this time is the chorus of the Knights, the tunes are warm and far-reaching, as if it is a reproduction of a beautiful life with the family, which makes them gradually full The will of "guardian" also allows the audience to understand the meaning of "guardian".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the real dragon, the princess is surrounded by a knight who fights for the protection of his homeland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear is the melody that the band plays perfectly with the atmosphere. Most of the audience have the anger of the same enemy, and the courage to face the behemoth has the tragic and sacred feeling of sacrificing love and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling made them touch themselves and let Ali clench his fists. If he is not afraid of death, what else is it? The farther distance is also the day after the end, as long as you take the first step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the charge rang, the melody became fierce and violent, so that the nobility and ordinary people who did not stimulate the blood force seized everything that could be grasped for everyone to Feeling the heroic, firm and embarrassing of a real charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of music makes them forever unforgettable, and this "the melody of the charge" reverberates in their hearts before they can find more classic than the previous scene. Music, but now, they understand that "Arush" is the core and most classic part of this opera! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle began. In the "horn of the charge", a knight fell, and there were fewer and fewer people around the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the princess stabbed the heart of the dragon at the expense of an arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small crystal "painfully" licking his abdomen, tumbling down in the ground, pressing the stage to squeak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword grows on the ground, the princess knees on the ground, looking around and discovering that the companion has all gone to the end, lost his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody changes again, sadness, sorrow and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess raised his head slightly, his mouth opened, as if the song rang from the depths of his soul: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Heroes will never die"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will only slowly fade away in people's memory"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Banus shuddered and felt the shudder from the soul to the flesh. The ethereal sorrow but the implied tragic melody directly hit his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t describe this feeling, only know that this song has deeply shocked himself, letting himself forget everything around him, completely immersed in song shaping. In the "world". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"bury my bones, don't erect tombstones"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This fertile plain and bustling The city is our best tombstone!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of crystal tears condensed in the corners of most of the audience, slipping silently, the princess pulled up the sword and walked hard Going back to the ground, leaving only a firm and straight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain slowly falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the best part of the opera I've ever heard, no more beautiful than it!" After a while, Oliver was excited. Congratulations to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha blinked: "I think so too, Lucien, thank you for your present."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what is the final aria called?" Oliver couldn't wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "The Tombstone of the Hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, absolutely Most of the audience was truly awake, and there was a fierce and enthusiastic applause in the Kingdom Theatre. Thunderous applause broke out in the square of the city of Holm. The other three countries in the Straits and the coastal cities of the Northland also have the same The applause of a volcanic eruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a study on the top floor of the Holm Royal Magic Tower, Hathaway sits behind the desk in front of a water reflecting the scene of the Grand Theatre of the Kingdom of Rentate screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
