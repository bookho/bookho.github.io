			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Electromagnetic Kingdom", Brooke has stopped the quill in his hand and focused on the wave function equation on the paper, which is so beautiful and concise It seems to contain all the mysteries of the micro world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubt that he has derived the wrong, because the solution to this wave function equation will be a series of discontinuous solutions, that is, the quantized solution, and The data of the experiments are consistent. In addition, he also got real-world feedback, so that the cognitive world of broken solidification is reborn with vitality. It seems that it will grow and sprout at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Matrix mechanics from particle and discontinuity can solve many of the problems of new alchemy. Wave functions from fluctuations and continuous angles also look promising. Particles and waves are as true as Lu Xi'an said. At a higher level, they are unified. Microscopic particles such as electrons and photons are things that we can't accurately construct a concrete image. They can only be described from identifiable surnames, even if these The surname is such a contradiction and the opposite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook looks at the formula on the paper, thinking deeply about the issues that are important to him, can really Grasping the "wave-particle two-image surname" and using it to solve the essential problem of electromagnetic waves is his reshaping of the cognitive world and even further hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing the electron diffraction experiment of the secondary strike and the peak-turn, he has a certain degree of recognition of Lucien’s theory of interpreting the essence of electrons from his mind. It is so persistent that the fluctuations are unwavering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the crisp ringtones were uploaded from the desk, and Brooke jerked back to God, and after the flash of light, he heard Oliver’s voice: "Brook, you are done too The construction of the wave function equation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you too?" Brooke guessed his condition from Oliver's joy and doubtful tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Brooke’s answer, Oliver laughed: “It turns out that we’re almost done at the same time. It’s no wonder that the real world’s feedback is not as much as I thought. One can definitely The classic equations of the microscopic world occupying the first few positions did not help me to break through the current obstacles and touch the door of the legendary peak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His tone is clearly relieved Emotions, the degree of real-world feedback, made him somewhat doubtful of the important surname of the equation, or the complete surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, it’s difficult to judge the absolute correctness of the theory from real-world feedback, because as long as it is closer to reality than before, it will get a certain degree of feedback, and Similar, unless it is beyond a lot of theories, like Lucien's general theory of relativity, and using real-world feedback to confirm whether the theory is correct or not, the cognitive world will change accordingly, so if you find a few contradictions When the theory is tried, as long as it is not the first time it is closest to the real, it is easy to be blasted. Oliver suspected this time, mainly because it is less than the previous experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be some other weakening, we should all start with the classic theory, make an analogy, and then directly construct a no matter what the arcane meaning, logical derivation Wave function equations, then return to the original verification, and look for specific arcane meaning, so before we have fully given the arc function of the arc function interpretation, the real world feedback will be reduced accordingly." Brooke analyzed the reason, he This wave function equation is quite proud, but it is equally calm and rational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver laughed and said: "Can there be any other arcane meaning? The electron is a wave, the orbit and the energy level are just vibration changes, of course, we You can't judge without any basis. You must use the wave function equation to solve the problem of the current new alchemy, solve the problem of the hydrogen atom model, and find out what the wave function represents the surname of the electron..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very happy and excited, but he does not immediately assert that his wave function equation must be more correct and more realistic than Lucien's matrix mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since we are almost at the same time reading power, then this equation is called the Oliver-Brook wave equation." Oliver suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook frowned and stretched: "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mainly remembers In the "World Reality" channel some time ago, the words of this naming style were ridiculed: "With my surname, crown your name", I feel a little weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the wave function, or write to Fernando, Hathaway, Helen, Vicente, En, Lucien exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why not Douglas, because he believes that Oliver will definitely write a letter to discuss, he is not necessary, and he also believes that Lucien, who proposed the concept of wave-granular two-image, will not accept the wave function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you see the "Starry Skyscape", Arcane Research on the Road to Sean Still adhering to the attitude of step by step, all based on experimental data and observation phenomena, since you have a broader prospect than other arcans, you can see more distant directions, why should you take risks? And the most important thing is that such research is also a process of learning and mastering. Lu Xien does not want to be unstable when there is no reference in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time ticking to the dinner time, Natasha, who was not worried, was very good. He came in with two letters: "Lu Xien, Lord Brooke And the letter from Lord Oliver, it seems that they have made new research progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the "Queen's Work", Natasha often served as Lucien "Secretary", help him send letters, take experimental materials, etc., so from the thickness of the envelope can be judged something, but in the more detailed experiments, Lucien often does not let her into the laboratory - Too many bad books! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the letter, Lucien smiled at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is there a problem with the results of your Brooke?" Natasha squinted at her chin and curiously asked, she had not read the level of the wave function paper, pure Judging from the expression of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien leaned back and leaned back on the chair. Natasha tacitly placed her hands on his forehead to help him relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the Golden Knight is good." Lucien snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked the left eyebrow: "That's because I didn't use all my strength, or your head was pinched directly, red blood, The white brain is spilled over the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Don’t talk about such a heavy taste in this warm moment." Lucien’s mouth twitched. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natashahaha laughed: "As the wife of the headshot and the broken skull, I think this is a normal topic. Right, you have not Answering my question, is it that Brooke’s results are wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, really great results.” Lucien said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the things that were explored in the dead world subsided, Douglas held The highest review group meeting, ready to discuss related matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he and Fernando and Lucien submitted the adventure report, they deliberately concealed Tanos and Viken as a kind of god-like approach, just vague It is said that Tanos is a kind of god by accumulating faith and special magical squad. The ancient devil is also a kind of god. The same is true of Viken. The specific content of this aspect is not given, and it is pushed to the destruction of Viken and the concealment of monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are worried that some of the members of the Supreme Council have gone the way of the ancient devil, so I will only consider three studies for the time being and gradually incorporate them into other big Olympics. The surgeon waited until Douglas or others became the gods on the road of arcaneism and then publicized the information to the highest evaluation group. When there was a bright direction, I believe that not many people would choose to have a lot of hidden dangers. Even if they choose, there is one. The class is in the presence of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is used to the early arrival of the surname, but the meeting room is empty, there is no Klaus figure, in general, the earliest will be he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien sighed softly and his emotions became dazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit for a while, the gray-haired Lavendi came in. After Lucine proposed matrix mechanics and solved many problems of the new alchemy, he finally did not Delays, through the ceremony has become a new element dominator, because this legendary occupation overlaps with Hathaway, he has a similar legendary title "Elemental Torrent." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
