			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, when, when, three consecutive melodious bells sounded, the dwarves outside the temple of "God of Craftsman" all paused, making a fist in the right hand, making Beaten posture, prayed in unison: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The great god of steam, you are the master of machinery, control the art of forging, give us strength and courage... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina, who is about to turn away, is slightly stunned, when does the god of craftsman become the god of steam? The Parliament’s attention to Dumte’s dwarf kingdom does not seem to be enough. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this 'Steam of the Steam' is not quite the same as the 'Steam of the Steam', which is the fate of the alchemy dwarves, and has prayer gestures and prayers. There are some notable differences.” When friends such as Katrina and Heidi strolled around Rentart and “field visit” alchemy workshops, they met the dwarves from the night plateau and were impressed by the strange prayer postures of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked around and saw the non-dwarf races of humans, werewolves, elves, etc. walking on the street also stopped. Although there was no prayer, it seems I didn't want to affect the noon prayer rituals of the dwarves, so I stopped and thought: "Looking at their familiar and natural moves, the god of craftsmen should become a god of steam for a while."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual tidy prayers create a peculiar resonance, so that the souls without prayer also feel the grand sacredness, the air is filled with strong wine, and the smoke is drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest feature of the Dumte dwarf kingdom. The dwarves like not just ale, but all kinds of wines are within their defensive scope. A large part of the merchants are selling wines in exchange for ore and dwarven alchemy items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves who have been transformed by the magician have the basic mental power. With their skill and talent, it is not difficult to produce apprentice-level alchemy items, and low-end, medium-level items need to be inspired by the dwarfs of blood power. The purpose of ancient high-level magicians to transform them is to bear The work of low-end, apprentice-level alchemy items, so as not to waste your time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for high-end alchemy items. . The dwarfs that can be forged are very rare, and the success rate is far lower than that of the magician. The legendary items are currently only the "God of Craftsman". Hite can do it with his own means of magic. "The God of Heroism" Ken can't finish it either. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different wines in different places, and they seem to be able to make people who are very light drink drunk or feel uncomfortable. Katrina was born in the Shahran Empire, and the amount of alcohol was extraordinary. Not only did she not hate it, but she took a deep breath. I narrowed my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noon prayer ends. Katrina followed the crowd and returned to the hotel where she lived. Close the window, start meditating, and recharge your night's actions—although the dwarves themselves are limited in height. But they are the bloody "civil civilization" blood flowing from the heart, like the delicate but grand architecture, so as long as the giant does not come to Dumte, there will be no sense of restraint, the stone houses here, The average indoor height is four meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is very late in the middle of the night, a team of dwarf soldiers on the street patrolled faithfully and vigilantly, because the god of craftsmen suddenly became the god of steam and "heroic The god is surrendered to him and other things, and the Kingdom of Dumte is in a state of instability. There are often emergencies, and there will be "the cultists" who oppose the great steam gods pick up all kinds of incidents. Therefore, Hamina City seems to be prosperous, but it is in a tight state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina first arranged a squad to eliminate magical volatility, and then blessed himself with high invisibility spells - although the Kingdom of Dumte was against the magician Without prejudice, there are a lot of fears for the casters, but what they have to do is related to their supreme spiritual leader, the “God of Craftsman”. Cautiousness is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feathered on the ground, Katrina sneaked toward the Temple of the Steam, while looking up at the astrology and surroundings, according to the coordinates given by the teacher The law calculates where the statue should be placed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does this formula require the specific coordinates of several temples and the types and coordinates of the surrounding buildings..." Katrina meditation on the many parameters needed, expressions Quite doubtful, this rule of coordinate change is really impossible to understand, what is it to calculate, how do you need so many weird parameters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the statue of Hite?" Katrina looked closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dwarf statue is dressed in a sacred pattern of armor, holding a giant hammer in his hand, his beard dragged to his chest, covering his face, two inside his eyes A dazzling sun stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really ugly compared to the statue given by the teacher..." Katrina took out the statue that Lucien had given her, and smiled and shook her head. The teacher’s aesthetics are always fluctuating.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of Lucien’s music, magic tower construction, and monthly time can no longer be denied. Many of the ideas of the proposed "Mystery Voice" are also eye-catching, but in many cases, the ideas and things he creates are unique and unacceptable, such as the dwarf statue assembled from many metal parts. Originally, the whole body shimmered in a cold and cold taste, and it looked very good, but he had a big bald head, and it was also engraved with a strange pattern of dark blue, which made people feel the illusion of the soul shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astringing smile, Katrina concentrated his attention, according to Lucian’s instructions, let the bald dwarf statue float in the heart of the “God of Craftsman” Hite The part, then whispered a long and complicated mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mantra is written in the ancient magic empire, but with a strange sense of divine ethereal, gradually, the bald dwarf statue highlights The roots are silvery white, they extend around, like a big net that controls people's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the master of the soul, the emperor of the gods, you are the great god of steam, please allow me to call your name, the supreme Yuri Please give the power to control everything..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the curse, the silvery light line extends into the heart of the statue of Hite. Part of it blends with the surrounding voids, causing a burst of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shock, a little clear and holy light appears like a tiny angel, which emits ethereal and beautiful songs, praises and prayers. The statue of Yuri "dancing" up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movement seems to be solidified around, and the temple in the distance is unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emptiness of the void suddenly became intense, and the tiny spots of light merged into the statue of Yuri, and the statue of Yuri slowly disappeared, and it disappeared in place. No more traces can be found! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combined with time and space?" Katrina looked at this scene, and her eyes were deeply shocked. The scene just happened was that she had never seen it before. The scene, "This is the subtlety of the legendary power? But why is there a bit of illusory magical temperament..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and converges on her emotions, Then erase the nearby traces and return to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her figure disappeared at the end of the street, a dark bird flew down in the dark sky, and there was a funny and pale and cold head. Feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little bird hovered over the head of the "God of Craftsman" Hite, sending out the hard sounds that only existed around: "Lusien Evans Sure enough, in the secret collection of faith, he seems confident in his own theory, and dare to directly steal the power of Hite's faith..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... actually sent a student to complete this thing, almost passed everyone, if not me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have to think of a way Remind Hite that you can't let Lucien Evans go smoothly to collect the power of faith, otherwise he may be the fastest step into the class of gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It flew down from the head of the statue, and circled around the circle. The mouth of the singer called "Du" and "Du" was like telling a creature about his death time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of Katrina’s departure from Hamina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of dwarf soldiers found a "cultist" who smashed and attacked "the god of steam" Hite while patrolling, and launched a fierce battle with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
