			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council headquarters, the 35th floor, a small conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the room, there is a regular cherry wood long table with 24 chairs around, each chair is very precious, red velvet The veneer is soft and very surnamed, and the back is engraved with different patterns, with symbolic figures of elements, storms wrapped with lightning, and crowns of magic and arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has been confirmed that the month that caused the change of the blush is the god of love of the moon, and the one who confronted him is a existence that has never existed before. It may come from a silent world with only black and white gray.” The tower “The Prophet” with a gray pointed hat gave a preliminary conclusion of what happened last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such an exaggerated vision, and it involves the two closest "real" existences. The highest scrutiny of the Magic Council is the fastest time to hold a meeting to discuss this Things, do a good job of follow-up arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twenty-fourth highest panelists, "Elemental Dominator" Hathaway and others were absent because they went out, and they couldn’t return, and they only went to 18 . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the words of the "Prophet", Vicente, who wore a black cloak and his eyes twitched with a dark red flame, knocked at the table: What we should be most concerned about at the moment is where Etna and the mysterious existence of the unknown and alienated space are where they are, and why they suddenly fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It should be related to the battle of the vampire prince Dracula and Rhein. According to the results of astrology, I went to the Dark Mountain Range at dawn and found that the watcher's castle of the Earl of Silvereye was seriously damaged and automatically jumped into the 'night. The plateau 'remains, and within a dozen kilometers around it has become a powder ruin, there is a strong Dracula 'taste'." Douglas said his findings, the tone is not anxious, "as for why they will fight, why Will involve a mysterious existence, there is no other information for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando bright red eyes look around the venue, see a lot of legendary magicians, big Mage micro Lowered eyes, not contact with him, so he picked the wrong, attracted a storm-like roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The search for the unknown space, I have made arrangements, Begner and Anonis will fully cooperate, if you have time, try to join, important surname I don't have to say more." He was the great arcian who guarded Aringe in the past few years. The original arrangement was naturally made by him. Bergner was the name of the "Prophet" and Anonis was "Astrology." home's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I have confirmed from other sources that this matter is related to Dracula and Rhein, and I want to find out why they are fighting for it. The mysterious existence cannot circumvent the silent world of black and white and gray!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, his gaze is directly opposite to "the soul of the dead" Vicente Vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, what do you mean?" "The soul of the dead" Vicente's dark red flame in the eyes flickered, he was not devoted to research, The crazy magician who doesn't understand human relationships at all, how could he not hear Fernando's words to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got an information from the Vaurit Principality, at the end of April 816, there was a drastic change on the shores of Lake Elsinore, and adventurers survived, they described The change is that 'the surrounding colors are beginning to fade, leaving only the monotony of black and white ash, the sound seems to disappear,' don't tell me, this has nothing to do with the silent black and white world around Silver Moon last night!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Rogerio was nearby, why did he report that there was no such thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fernando's eyes are sharp and almost roaring, and the "survivor" of Lake Elsinore in the mouth is of course Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the ambush of the church, Hathaway’s hands-on, there were many survivors at the time, not to mention the vigils who participated in the “Silver Point” The knights of the people and the Principality, as long as they noticed this matter, it is not difficult to find out, so after knowing from Natasha, Lucien did not conceal and directly told the teacher Fernando that he could find out sooner or later. It is better to sell well in advance, but also to clarify the relationship between yourself and the world of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to ask Hathaway." The soul of the dead has pushed everything to Hathaway who has not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando continued to roar, and the fierce "storm" made the soul of the dead can not help but sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler City’s abnormalities are so obvious that the other members of the highest jury are aware of the facts, but they have not been able to find the reason before, so this is not mentioned, now Seeing that the silent world of black and white is quite similar to the situation in Heidler City, there is no doubt in their hearts, but in the face of Vicente, they all hope that the storm will dominate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando did not live up to their expectations, and mercilessly exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead is so thin that it seems that only one layer of skin is not shocked: "Because the city of Heidler is connected to an unknown space, it becomes contaminated. In this way, this space can greatly enhance the ability of the Necromancer to summon the undead and use the Necromancer spell. Unfortunately, we have not found its entrance and it is difficult to explore it deeply, so it is not clear whether it is related to the silent world of black and white. I plan to go back to the investigation and then put it forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Vicente can only tell the truth about the realm of the dead, anyway, Finding the entrance is not that easy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, both things have a direction, the next step is to ask Hathaway and Rogerio. Everyone here to arrange their own research and exploration. I have time to help these two things. After all, this involves the truth of the world." Douglas seized the opportunity to announce the end of the conference before Fernando continued to growl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rest of the Supreme Council left, Fernando, who stayed behind, shook his head slightly: "Things are more complicated than you think."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not fully believe in Lucian’s rhetoric, but he respected his “right to privacy” and did not ask in detail, as long as the general matter was correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the storm of self-confidence, in this world, as long as it has been done, there will always be clues left, he believes he can investigate or explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, although Lucien said that he was not remembered and looked like by Dracula, he would not be remembered by him, but he found Natasha. Help, then someone can start from Natasha's whereabouts and moves, and finally speculate on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Fernando took the Lucian space and jumped back to the Principality of Vaolirit. One was really confusing them, after doing such a big thing, Normal people will not return to the 'live' immediately. Second, if there is any secret, some people really doubt Lu Xien, then his own actions indicate that this secret has been submitted to the Magic Council by Lucien, and wants to destroy it. Kill the entire magic parliament! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritual power is closely related to the soul and the cognitive world, to it Exploration, as well as improvements to the meditation, need to be cautious and careful. Over the years, the magical parliament’s high-level magicians who have been injured by improving their own meditations are not one or two, and even those who have been unlucky to die, so Lucien redoes the photoelectric induction experiment, from the wave-particle two of the light. After the surname and the mental power, I did not immediately create a unique meditation idea. Instead, when I meditate every day, I will adjust it according to the effect and adjust it according to the effect. It is expected that it will take two to three years to perfect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pick open the window, the evening wind of the cold moon whistling into, let people can not help but shudder, but also bring the mind fully awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Affris, who was concentrating on the barbecue in the garden, smiled and shook his head, and he has been back for several days, gradually increasing There was an opportunity to show up, but no one doubted that it was related to the moon of blush, because in the eyes of the Arcanists other than Fernando and Toms, the host of the Atomic Research Institute, Lucien? Evans never left Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that Lucien is worried about being assassinated by the church, so this time has not been distracted, and to improve the magic power, this is quite a normal choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is thanks to the usual pretend of Aphrodite and that he has not left for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, Mr. Arthur came to visit again, or refused with the previous reasons?" As a big butler, Leo is one of the few to know Lucien The person who came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Let him come in, I have to ask about the production of magic crystal lamps."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
