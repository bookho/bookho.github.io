			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter Lucien, or Gary, Correa, they didn’t hear the sound of fighting, the screaming voice, or the sound of leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, strong, silent, and powerful high-ranking knights of Howson are so silent that they are so silent? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coolness rises rapidly from the soles of the feet, spreading the whole body, and Lucian’s breathing becomes slightly heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the shining sword tightly, Lucien quickly turned his head and looked behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the sewer wall, the blue moss glows with a faint glow, and the unseen Hausen makes them look very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a scream rang, and Lu Xien, who had just turned his head and was nervous, looked at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge human-like mouse has knocked Correa down to the ground, sharp claws piercing his shoulders, breaking the hard chain mail The blood rushed out, stained with silver-gray nails, and it had a pair of red eyes, and there seemed to be some ridicule in the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just its mouth wide open, and the row of daunting teeth, but biting on the long sword that Correa hits in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-ranking knight attendant, Correa saved his life with the most standard swordsmanship in the most dangerous time, and he held it in his left hand. The shield, slammed out, hit the belly of the huge mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear that has emerged is far below the unknown, at least for Lucien, a red-eyed giant mouse that is only the size of an ordinary human being and has no sound and no action. More acceptable than "mysterious disappearance". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a breath, Lucien did not delay, holding the lightsaber to the red-eyed giant rat, to rescue Correa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a low, beast-like roar is behind Bethine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gary also has an accident?!" When Lucien remembered Gary standing behind him, a sharp knight slammed into the ground. Lucien's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light brilliance of the light shield of the Holy Light swayed violently, and it fainted a lot. At the same time, the huge impact force made Lu Xien stand unsteady, to the front. Shake a few steps in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chase of the knight’s sword came out and smashed out continuously, so that Lu Xien’s rush could not grasp the balance completely, and even the shining sword could not be swayed. Not to mention the spirit of concentration, Capricorn, and the use of mantras to stimulate the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was flustered and stunned, and he was shocked and confused: "Why did Gary attack me?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack from the Cavaliers sword is coming from behind. If it is not Gary, there is only one possibility, Gary is dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacking rhythm of the Cavaliers’ sword is very good, and does not give Lucien the opportunity to stabilize the center of gravity, and will force Lucien to stumble into the secret room. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being continuously shackled, Corusian found that he had not suffered any harm, and his panic gradually calmed down. He had a shield of light, why should he still Looking to restore balance, and his melee? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea flashed past. When the knight’s sword came again, Lucien went home and fell to the ground, rolling over, and preparing for the left hand. Hold the holy emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Lucien finally figured out who was attacking himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really Gary, calm and restrained Gary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles on his face have been twisted, his eyes are red, and the naked wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the red-eyed mouse's poisonous surname not be completely eliminated, and can also make people lose their rational names and become bloodthirsty beasts?" Lucien When I saw Gary's appearance, I thought about this aspect. "But why am I not doing anything, I don't feel any abnormalities?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The round shield wrapped in iron sheet was swung out and hit on the shield of the Holy Light, and the shield of the Holy Light was shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this shield did not break the shield of the Holy Light, but the conduction of the shaking and impact, but let Lucien chest sigh, breathing poor, half thought The mantra that came out was stuck in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next slam hit, letting Lucien’s breathing rhythm be frequently disrupted, and no longer able to concentrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a waiter who is expected to become a true knight, Gary has good, formal training in interrupting spellcasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, whether it’s a pastor, a magician, or even another caster, when you see Lucien, you will shake your head and sigh, only the most basic spells are focused. The unlearned guy will be interrupted by the Cavaliers, and will be replaced by any apprentice pastor or magic apprentice. There is a sacred sacred emblem and an inspired shield of light. Gary should have died long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the same order, the caster will always have an absolute advantage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is troubled by the inability to concentrate and inspire the magic, while Correa has become more and more dangerous, it seems to be weak and long The right hand of the sword has been pressed to the chest, and the wrist has a slight unreachable shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the humanoid giant rat that entangled with him seems to be inferior, not as fierce as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to read the mantra, Lucien simply pulled the radiant sword held by his right hand, no longer entangled in the spirit of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After strangling with the red-eyed mouse group, Lucien has a certain understanding of the sharpness of this summoned lightsaber, it is definitely far better than The knight's sword held in Gary's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heavy attack of Gary Shield, Lucien’s sword seemed to be indiscriminate and swaying, unable to maintain stability and unable to target Gary’s vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the face of this sun-like sword, Gary did not act like a lost beast, but hurriedly blocked the knight’s sword forward. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t seem to dare to go away. Once he is away from Lucien, facing a circle of magic, even the formal, inspiring blood force. The knight is also very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will be seriously injured or even die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glorious Sword is on the knight's sword, but there is no crisp sound of metal impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent sword, like a piece of wood, broke into two halves, but at this time, Gary has already retracted the shield. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep scratch on the round shield, which is almost divided into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is about to take the opportunity to counterattack, but the shining sword has already fainted many shining swords, but at this time it collapsed and the pieces flew in the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wall with the magic trap, the brilliance of the lost power began to exhaust everything and could not be maintained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stunned, and Gary took the opportunity to slam the round shield and hit the same thin and bleak On the light shield, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield fragments fluttered in the sky, and the light shield shook a little and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main Guardian Shield of Lucien is completely broken after experiencing continuous attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time to reflect on the mistakes that have been made because of little or no fighting experience. Lucien captained the cross on the emblem and spelled it. The spirit of concentration, read the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"S...Cough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short syllable only makes a half-voice, Gary has long been The prepared punch hit heavily on Lucien's abdomen, and Lucien was curled up like a shrimp, and his throat was full of acidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
