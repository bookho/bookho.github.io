			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, when Downey struggled to get up, the sudden knock on the door interrupted the "self-introduction" of "Karl" and let the two At the same time, people turned their attention to the door. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the snarling in the classical magic robes in front of the swaying door that was half open due to the collapse of the wall chain. The necromancer looked at them with a blank expression. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muscles of Downey’s face are still paralyzed, but the heart can’t help but groan. As the mage responsible for the discipline and safety of this magic tower, you actually wait until the danger is lifted. Just arrived! Is it like the series of "Sky TV" and "Lentart TV", the police or the Knights will always be late? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired Necromancer holds a notebook with a black cover in his hand, sweeping his eyes indifferently, sweeping the broken monster and sewing the body. On the other hand, while recording, I heard the sound: "The mutated sutured corpse, with most of the low-order materials, refining the suture corpse close to the level of the big knight, exceeding the best level of the past years, but the refining of the suture is not controlled. , the corresponding score must be deducted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary suture corpse, can fully play the 'mummy arm' ability, the strength is equivalent to a formal knight, able to withstand The mutated sutured corpse twice, for the magic apprentice, this is a rare finished product, and the sutured corpse is completely under the absolute control of the refiner..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey was stunned, he just watched the accident. But why not shoot? Have confidence in "Karl"? Or take the opportunity to identify our sutures? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is there any problem with our test?" Formerly known as Blaise, but he called himself a Carl boy, with a bit of a warm look. I was pleased to ask, "In fact, I joined the concept of the 'original body' in the refining process. I want to let the ordinary sutures reflect the relevant ideas and integrate the flying ability. **In the middle of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explained his refining ideas in a sly way, listening to Donnie’s mouth twitching, you don’t say your original idea Now, it is a successful variant sutured corpse. It can definitely pass the assessment. According to your real plan and experimental plan, this is an experimental accident. Not only does it have no ability to fly, but it is a strange product combining death and strange power! Can this kind of thing be said casually? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer at the door had a pair of amber eyes that were slightly turbid, and at this time he lowered his eyes and blocked the pupil, and continued to waven and said: The two sutures can be rectified, indicating that you have no problem with the identification of the materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie wakes up and writes the sheepskin The paper has decayed into ash under the death ring of the monster. Fortunately, the teacher approved his sutured body and judged the identification result in reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your specific results will be announced together with the basic subjects, and then you can check them out." Necromancer picked up the notebook and ignored Karl still wants to share himself. The refinement of the idea, turned and went out, suddenly, he stumbled: "The key moment to call 'help' is really more useful than your own hopeless resistance..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, Downey’s face is red, and his shouts are really more stern and stern, more sharp than the girls who are scared by ghosts in the general school, losing their usual time. Self-deprecating is calm and determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this blood surge also resolved his paralysis, let him struggle to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I’m sorry, just patronizing myself, forgetting to help you, how? No injury? Look at the hidden problems." Carl's silver-purple eyes faded sharply, like a quiet lake in the waves, swaying the waves, swaying the gentle and quiet, seeing Downey subconsciously closed The eyes are so beautiful, or just listen to the sound, otherwise you will not be able to curse the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your expression tells me that your spirit has been greatly impacted, but I have observed the mutated sutures before, except for the shock, you should not have the spirit The influence of the above, there are problems that I have not seen, hehe..." Karl suddenly realized what he was doing, scratching his head, "haha" smiled. "It should be just scared, right, just my self-introduction I was interrupted by the invigilator. My name is Blaise. This is the name my father took. It is the meaning of 'happy people' in the lingua franca, but I prefer..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! You are the first person to accept my new name so quickly." Carl smiled and narrowed his eyes, and his mouth was sharply tilted. "My current goal is to be a real man, right. I still don't know what your name is. I see your magic robe. It should be a 'natural heart' student. Is there a lot of elves inside? When I went to Stroop Forest last time, the elder elders Tell me that more and more elves are now in love with our human life and are willing to seek a sustainable development path in which social development and nature conservation coexist harmoniously..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I, my name is Downey." Downey listened to the voice of the man with the magnetic name, and he was more awkward in his heart. Ms. No, classmate, if you don't talk, you are standing there quietly. At that time, it was really a quiet and moving landscape. "We have finished the test and can't stay here according to the regulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl suddenly patted the palm of his hand: "Yeah, let's talk while walking, Don. The sutures you refine are very good, but you can reduce the level of theoretical guidance. For example, I use the concept of 'initial body'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is the 'original body'?" Downey was half curious, and half stopped Carl from asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The original body' is derived from the 'original' concept and the 'return of life' ritual of the ancient Mesquite empire, they think..." Clearly summarizing the origin, theory, development, and evolution of the original body until he walked out of the magic tower, he did not stop, and he seemed to enjoy it. "For example, the soul of the dead soul can become a legend." The peak is to improve and refine the 'original body' success..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, "The Voice of Mystery" and the TV station can not mention, magic The teachers in the school were also out of reach, so Downey couldn’t feel dizzy, but he was still excited. It’s just a secret. If Carl can describe it shortly, of course, his voice is as clear as a spring. It’s wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he bowed, this secret, where is the ordinary magic apprentice know? Carl, is Carl the big man who came with a large aircraft? Is it the object of the "guardian" squad of the "Sword of Truth"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he subconsciously looks around, as if the knights of the "Guardian" squad are hiding behind the street trees on both sides, their Gauss rifles are always aimed at themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking like this, his forehead instantly secreted cold sweat, and the instinct was behind the cool breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Donnie, have you understood?" Carl's voice passed into his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny’s body trembled and stuttered: “What, what?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You didn't understand it? Then I will say it again." Carl was not angry at all, but he was more excited and seemed to explain it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s head swelled and interrupted Carl’s words: “I’ll probably understand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh." Carl stopped talking about some unhappiness, his face was slightly heavy, and the gentle and quiet face without deterrence unconsciously revealed a bit of majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Downey’s heart to jerk a few times. When it’s over, will it be set by the Goss rifle? Can you still have a corpse that is probably completely preserved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It, in fact, you are more suitable for the Cavaliers, I think your strength can rival the big knight." Downey stuttered the topic, What he wants to say in his heart is that he can match the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl smiled and said: "My strength is just average."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved at random Right hand, slammed into the street tree similar to the phoenix tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurricane, the street tree directly became two cuts from the interruption, and fell to the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, I am just demonstrating my strongest strength. You see, you can only interrupt an ordinary tree." Carl "haha" laughs. The right hand patted Donnie's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
