			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swan Lake, Rose Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day's meeting is close to the second half, each speaker gets applause, and they talk about the time and time after the presentation of their own papers. The comments of the high-ranking magicians helped them to improve their research results, and also inspired some of the arcans. After lunch, Larry’s research and definition of atomic valence was the warmest and most resounding of the entire conference. section. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are so many arcane masters who need to tell their own research results, the meeting schedule is very compact, otherwise they will not be able to meet their enthusiasm in five days, so even if it is already four in the afternoon There are many points, and there are still many arcanes waiting in line. The meeting of this day is far from coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses, who has a yellowish hair and looks ordinary but strong, embarks on the podium, launches the magical array that shows the scene, and begins to share himself with other arcans. The results of this period of research: the critical temperature of the gas found when trying to improve the five-ring magic "Gasdong poisonous fog" into the form of water arrows, that is, if the temperature is exceeded, even if the pressure is increased, the gas cannot be liquefied. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery is quite novel and can effectively guide the improvement of the magical structure. Basically all the arcans have an interest, and they listen very seriously, even Lucy. I know this theory, but it can be verified by Ulysses, which shows that it is suitable for this different world. At the same time, Lucien is most concerned about how the basic theory maps to the details of the magic structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a yellow-brown owl flew in and landed on the table in front of Gaston, gently licking and listening to Julius The speech of Gaston's hand back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the element's famous "postman", the gatekeeper's magician and knight know that he is Matthew of Gaston's governor, so he has not stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon took a funny hand and touched the feathers on Matthew’s back, then took off the papers hanging from it and set aside, ready Wait until the end of today's meeting and then arrange for someone to review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Matthew came a budgie, proudly hovering over the top of Lavin for two weeks before leaving it on the chest. Several papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, several other birds also flew in and fell to the other three members of the Arcane Review Board, bringing the distribution to them. Papers, but they are not in a hurry. Let's not mention that the current assignment or review is a disrespect for Ulysses. The papers that require complex experimental arguments may take a month or two to be reviewed. There is no need to worry - they are such a big man that never let the audit work disturb their research, magic practice and life, unless it is a very important paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the in-depth explanation of Ulysses, other arcans are more and more focused, only the nine-level arcane master, the nine-ring magician Lavin is a little leisurely Because he is the teacher of Ulysses, he has carefully read this after passing the review, and the content has been thoroughly mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened for nothing for a while, Raven took up several papers in front of his pet, flipped it over and looked at the title of the paper in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a striking topic jumped into his eyes: "A new element discovered according to the periodic table of elements and its determination." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This topic contains the meaning that makes Raven the frowning, "found according to the periodic table of elements" means that the periodic table of elements has the role of guiding the surname, and What does this mean, as a nine-level arcane master, a nine-ring magician, as a big man who has studied the law of elements, Lavin is very clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the paper, Lavin looked at it carefully and looked at it. His face suddenly changed, and the stage was amplified by magical sounds. The loud sound of Ulysses came as if it had disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper reached the last page, and Lavin’s gaze did not move away for a long time, then he used his strong self-control to keep himself calm and turned around. Rebecca, who is in charge of the hospitality, came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca listened carefully to the speech of Ulysses while paying attention to the situation of the Arcanists - she was cautious after being reprimanded by Leandre. Don't dare to make any more mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me the paper "On the cycle surname between elemental surrogate and atomic weight and the prediction of some new elements" by Lucian Evans? X." Lavin said in a simple and concise manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca heard the name that was cursed today, and subconsciously looked at Lucien, who stood with Lazar in the corner, he would Not X? Did the paper anger Mr. Ravendi? Mr. Ravendi’s face is not very good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions arise, but at the time Douglas Magic School had only one Lucian? Evans, Rebecca is really unable to determine whether the difference between the letter is X or not, can only recall the name of the paper that sounds familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lavindi, this paper is in the last few pages of the "Elements" journal in your hand." Soon, Rebecca was so fluent, tone With a little joy, the ability to complete Mr. Ravendi's request so smoothly and simply will be praised and can make up for the previous mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the title of this paper is long enough to allow you to leave an impression when you are able to read it [***]. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's first words, without losing the grace of the "Elemental" journal, directly to the last one, said in the mouth: "Elemental Journal" It is not always an idiot to audit the Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a praise quoted by the storm. When Lavin was in a state of turmoil, he failed to maintain his own. Cultivate, learn to say it, although his cultivation is only a little better than the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the words that Laven’s vice president can leave, Rebecca continued to stand by him and then peeked at his face with intense curiosity And the paper in hand, why did the vice president lord suddenly want to find this paper, what is it strange or important? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t dare to see it too clearly, Rebecca couldn’t clearly see the main content of the paper, but she was surprised to find that Mr. Ravendi’s face became abnormal. dignified. This makes her panic and fear, is there something big to happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't consider the atomic weight of the elements that don't give experimental data..." Lavin said to himself, then quickly turned to Rebec Card Road: "Give me these elements to purify..." This is one of the few that was missing from his alchemy cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he quickly told the budgie "Harry" a little faster: "Go to Odongko to buy a few pieces of amphibole, it is big The grandson of the grizzly bear, and come back in the shortest time. Harry, you can't be lazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am like a lazy gentleman?" Harry muttered dissatisfiedly. The sound is in a round, beautiful, and then flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca did not understand Laven’s request, but the vice president’s instructions told her that she could not obey, and that other low-level magicians noticed the venue. After the situation, she hurried to the second floor of the main manor house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other arcans are listening to the speech of Ulysses, and have not noticed the matter here, because the low-level magician next to him is taking Things like white paper and black cup of black tea appear from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Ulysses ended his speech and then in-depth discussions with the questioning arcane masters, waiting for him to leave the podium, warm The applause sounded without exception, and most of the arcane masters felt that they had just harvested a lot, the applause slowly subsided, and Ulysses once again stunned, and Leandre looked around at the arcane master sitting below, ready to invite the next one. The speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw the vice president’s lord standing up without warning, and the pace was slightly hurried to the half-height metal platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the arcane surgeons’ eyes were cast on Lavindi. I don’t know why he did this. Is there something big happening? Or Mr. Ravendi was inspired by the speech of the paper just now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandro has the courage to stop a nine-ring magician with many prominent identities, watching Ravin stand on the podium and turn the scene into a magical array. Open, take his alchemy hut out of the space storage bag and zoom into a sophisticated and complete magic laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to disrupt the arrangement of the venue." Raven tried to make his voice less exciting, after all, he needed himself. Experiment with your own hands to verify, "Please turn to the last paper in the "Elements" journal in your hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The topic of the relationship between the surname and the atomic quantity and the prediction of some new elements" jumped into the eyes of the Arcanists. Larry and Timothy frowned slightly because this was their paper reviewed. What did Mr. Ravendi propose to do separately? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the author’s name, the Arcane division level also made Larry associate, and looked back at Lucien: “Is his thesis? He thinks he Is the paper worth enough to be invited by the annual meeting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Lavendi questioningly, what happened? Did Mr. Ravendi find a paper that can be filled in the periodic table? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expectation of the heart suddenly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ravendi, this periodic table of elements is very interesting, the regular surname is obvious, but the atomic weight error he predicted is a little hard to convince." After watching it for a while, another member of the Arcane Review Committee, the Eight-Ring Arcane Master and the Eight-ring Magician Locklini took the lead in questioning. The other Arcans had almost the same look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven saw that everyone basically browsed the paper, so he amplified the voice: "Please skip some elements such as Temiric and let us watch Behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he took out the purifying elements, opened the alchemy array of his magic laboratory, etc., purified again, and then witnessed the next one. Measurement data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy and other arcanists are puzzled, but Lavendi is an authoritative gentleman, so they quietly watched him live experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One atomic quantity data is corrected by several new methods, and four arcane review committees such as Gaston, Avery, Locklint, and Lydia The committee members began to solemnly, picking up the feather pen and other records, other magicians also clearly revealed the shocking emotions, atomic weight error is not strange, but the correct atomic quantity after correction can be perfectly filled in the periodic table. Unbelievable things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry and Timothy licked their foreheads at the same time, they should first verify the data behind, and now where to find the magic ore described to satisfy their own strong Curiosity, expectation, and shocking emotions that seem to explode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses looked at the periodic table of elements, as if he was in a daze, and it was so strange to give up because of the discovery of the critical temperature of the gas three weeks ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the more than 40-minute experiment by Lavin's Master, most of the Arcane Masters began to pay attention to this paper, but they The same contradiction and doubts, Ulysses first spoke: "Mr. Ravendy, these atomic weight corrections are not evidence of the surname, because the atomic weight of the previous part is difficult to explain."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why isn't our existing approach difficult to measure?" Lavindi said his reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ofrey shook his head: "This can only be assumed, there is no data at the moment indicating that Lavin is correct."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In arcane research, it is difficult to convince most arcane masters that there is no evidence to determine the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the abominable name, Leandre will inevitably leave a negative impression. At this time, he also interjected: "Mr. Ravendi, this is just The fairy tale conjecture of the first-class arcian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is about to express his point of view, the budgie "Harry" is flying outside the manor, it Hanging a magical utensil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven laughed: "Ladies and gentlemen, let's start a wonderful experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the magic vessel, which contains a few amphibole mines. Lavin's description of the Woods paper is the most convenient way to separate the matter, unlike Woods' separation after several attempts, avoiding wasting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the separation of the material, Lavin said to all the Arcans: "This is a kind of magic similar to the characteristics described in the "Table of the Elements" paper. Minerals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon, Locklini, Gary, Yuriss, and so on all the arcane masters have guessed what will happen, they hold on Breathing, and excitedly watching Lavendi put the separated matter into the spectroscope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
