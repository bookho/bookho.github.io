			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ring will make the wearer more focused, calmer, and more difficult to interrupt when performing magic, equivalent to a constant five-ring magic 'focus' The effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" At the same time, pure and innocent, it contains a powerful magical power, capable of performing five-ring magic 'ball lightning' twice a day, seven rings The magic 'anti-magic ray' twice (sealing state, the mental strength is completely dry and can not be recovered in a short time and the vitality is greatly damaged, the price can be applied through the seal before the sixth level)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery of electronics opens the door to the microcosm and changes the understanding of the material world in the magical world. We would like to thank the discoverers of electronics, the excellent arcane masters, and the elements in this ring. The explorer who left a deep footprint in the field of magic, Mr. Lucian Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery from the rays must be strong due to the rays!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Morrishofen Grid. " <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After figuring out the details of the "electronic" ring, Lucien is quite shocking, and Morris’s strength in alchemy is probably less than two. The legendary alchemist Davy and Klaus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the constant magic effect is two less than the previous "element" ring, the five-ring magic is one less, and the seven-ring magic is used less often. Once, but this time the added seven-ring magic is "anti-magic ray", its surname is special, it is difficult to coexist with other magic and magic effects, can consistently "focus" effect and attach a five-ring magic, use the road Sean’s heart is simply “God's skill”, and this magic can be used well, even if Lucien’s cognitive world is not initially substantive, it is possible to deal with high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien wearing this ring on his left middle finger, Morris once again had the urge to shed tears, a masterpiece of his alchemy career. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swallowing bitterness", Morris once again took out a ring, and the light white ring of the openwork pattern was inlaid with a large transparent diamond to refract the light. Innumerable rays of light, dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris took this ring and forced himself to give a prize:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From us humans Since we got rid of the state of barbarism, we are exploring the mysteries of life, eager to know where we came from, what is the beginning of life. Countless great magicians have not been able to find the answer to this problem. Not even able to get closer to the real step, but Lucien Evans designed a miracle experiment that mimics the original environment with his genius thinking, showing us a possibility of the origin of life. At that moment, his brilliance is enough Any god is beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first step for humans to step into the 'lifebound zone', but definitely not the only step, the elemental will and Holm Royal Magic This ring recognizes Mr. Evans's "miracle" in the field of elements and life. He hopes that all magicians can invest in this field. This is the twenty-eighth Holm crown, its name is 'origin '."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause sounded again, the magicians were more heated than before, the new particles broke everyone's cognition, but they couldn't compare with the shock brought by the miracle experiment. No one can fear life. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three Holm crown rings, I really want to be like Evans." The magic apprentices brought in by the road to the mixed dinner were standing in the corner. I looked at Lucien to accept the Holm Crown Award. The dazzling ring swayed their eyes, and the great glory symbolized their heartfelt yearning. Even Annick, who had been silent and whose name was slightly weak, could not help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina’s eyes sparkled as Lucine took over the sparkling “original” ring, and the instinct of the female surname and the Arcane Master made her very impulsive. Subconsciously blurted out: "I want a ring like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want a ring like this." The tender voice came from her side. Averyus took the largest silver fork, carrying a huge plate, and dripping down, completely forgetting the food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of Evans teacher is really fascinating!" Heidi and Reyia's focus is slightly different from them, but they also yearn for a Hall. The Crown Ring, this is the dream and honor of every magician who is good at elements and alchemy before the legend, like Isabella, who is already a high-level magician, still tirelessly chasing the wizard's laurels, the value of the prizes for them It doesn't matter, what matters is the glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw a few regrets about Lucien's three rings. Why did I go to the battle mage at that time?" Florensa smiled slightly and complicatedly. "The ring designed by myself can't be worn by myself." Hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have one? We have nothing." Another element of the will of the high-level, good at fighting female mage Caroline half It’s half sighing and it’s fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa’s right hand does wear a colorful gem-shaped Holm crown ring, but that’s not what she got, but her husband Oliver’s cornerstone". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timousy and Yurissie glanced at each other and saw the bitterness in each other’s eyes. Larry and Felipe, both in the past and their own. They each won the Holm Crown Award, and later Lu Xien won three more. Sometimes, I have to admit that there are some people who appear to show the "unfairness" of creation. At this time, what is needed is to catch up harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't be too far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Effort!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the meaning of the other party, the two raised a glass of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the ring and routinely rubbed the inner layer of the ring:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Horse 817 Erm Crown, I would like to thank Mr. Lucien Evans (819 years). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holme Crown Ring 'origin', a seven-level perfect magic item (a layer of seal) that requires mental strength to reach the level of high-level magician to unravel Seal, play full power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This chic, dazzling ring has three magic effects: it can interfere with the predictions of high-level magicians, Detecting that there is a certain possibility that the results they get will be distorted; it will allow the wearer to adapt to environments such as hell, abyss, etc. that are not suitable for human survival; it can store some of the spiritual power of the caster in advance, giving feedback when he is mentally exhausted (about equivalent) The spiritual power required for three ordinary five-ring magic.)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical power of the original environment is turbulent and violent, so that this ring has twice a day' Chaotic transmission 'ability (seven-ring magic, seal state, dedication to mental exhaustion can not be recovered in a short period of time and the cost of vital damage is greatly damaged by the seal before the sixth level)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The trace experiment describes to us a possibility of the origin of life. It gives us enlightenment with the design and results of the shocking surname. We would like to thank the 'Voice of the Goddess of Life', Mr. Lucien Evans, thanks to this ring. He linked non-living matter to the birth of life, and extended the definition of elemental magic to a larger extent. He is an arcane master who cannot be circumvented in the history of elemental magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of life may come from the original environment of chaotic dangers. The chaotic transmission of uncontrollable destinations can sometimes allow life to continue. Of course, you must pray for the blessing of the goddess of probability and the fate of fate. , fortunate blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Morris?Hoffenberg". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic transmission" is available in both magic and magic. Because it does not require spatial positioning, it allows the caster to escape tens of kilometers, as for the last Where it appears, you need the "Lucky Goddess" photo, it may be the crater that is erupting, it may be a gap in the crack, or it may be the side of the companion, the security is the same, it may be another enemy before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ring is no less difficult than just the 'electronic' refining...so there are no two five-ring magic." As a magician in the field of elements Lu Xien still has a good judgment on alchemy items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most precious thing about this ring is that it can pre-store its own mental power, and you can get timely feedback after the extension of the other Holm crown ring. Escape, but since this feedback is only equal to the extent of the three five-ring magic, the second overdraft use will definitely consume a lot of life, which will shorten the life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as far as Lucian is concerned, the cognitive world has been initially materialized, and the seven-ring magic with the three-time Holm crown ring can be used continuously. The need for constant effects is less urgent. However, adding it is equivalent to four magical spells. When faced with high-level magicians, it is no longer so weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
