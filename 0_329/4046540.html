			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James, the Earl of Pine, and other enlightened aristocrats looked at each other and saw the opposition in the other's eyes, although Natasha came to the Kingdom of Holm, but At that time, she was still young, and she could not see the political tendency. Her teacher, "The Light of God," Beria, was a member of the Cardinal Mission. This is a fact that cannot be erased. According to reliable information, she has been receiving since the age of six or seven. The care and cultivation of the church became a devout believer, just a little better than Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In accordance with the bloodline inheritance relationship, the Vimentan female count Natasha is the second-order heir to the Royal Servant, and is also a knight, devout Believers, so it is the most reasonable heir to the throne.” Rex’s face is stiff and his eyes are sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke Russell stood up and shook his feathers: "President Rex, we are all very clear about this, but why do we discuss it? It was because Her Royal Highness Princess Meredith, the mother of the Countess Natasha, became a magician and automatically gave up the right to inherit the throne, that is, her children no longer enjoyed this right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Pine and Harrison Harrison smiled a bit, and they obviously tended to use the magician as an excuse to oppose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Sorenfen solemnly said: "If this logic is true, then in this case, David will have no inheritance. The inheritance of the nobility comes from the blood. Noble, unless deprived of by the Code, can be enjoyed, and the Countess Natasha inspires the most pure blood of the sword of truth, which can be directly derived from His Majesty the King and His Royal Highness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex was a little relieved, and the Duke of Sorenfen seemed to accept the result, so he followed: "The reason I just met to discuss the candidate, not directly let Nata Her Royal Highness Princess Shah’s succession to the throne is because she is currently the sole heir to the Vaurit Principality. According to Article 5, paragraph 3, of the succession of the Code, if the successor has the inheritance rights of other countries and families and cannot merge, then Inheritance is reduced by one level, which is exactly the same sequence as David and Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vaurit is the center of the church's northwest defense system, the church impossible It is intended to merge with the Kingdom Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the first two candidates failed to receive unanimous approval, it is absolutely no problem to propose Princess Natasha." He has changed his name to Natasha. For Her Royal Highness, she acknowledged her position in the Holm king room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke James, Duke Russell, do you have any reasons for opposition? If not, we will have to vote." Rex looked at the Kaiming The leader of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James and others were caught off guard. They thought that for various reasons, the conservatives would ignore Natasha like them. After all, Meredith and Hathaway’s relationship is well known and he is also an excellent magician. Who knows...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surname? No, the inheritance rights of female surnames are clearly written in the Code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength? No, even in the twenties, they become heavenly knights. In the future, they are expected to attack the genius of legendary ranks, and they are superior to any one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too close to the church? No, except that it is a devout believer, Natasha has not been criticized, and has never harmed the aristocratic interests of the Vaolirit Principality to please the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for her will suppress the development of the magic parliament on the bright side, prohibit the promotion of magic radio, telephone, etc., it is impossible to get things on the table, can not always Brightly declares that we are working with the magician. If so, Rex is likely to suddenly turn his face and let Sard come in to clean the aristocrats who have been lured by the magician. This kind of thing can never be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, the enlightened aristocrats could not find a good reason to object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the Duke of Sorenfen who took care of the black cockroach and got up and asked: “President Rex, I heard a rumor about Her Royal Highness Princess Natasha, hope Can be explained. It is rumored that she and the 'fallen angel' Lucian Evans is a deep-loving lover, will she deviate from her aristocratic position and indulge the magic parliament, thus angering the church?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Louise and others came to Holm Kingdom, Lucien’s identity was long ago not a secret, and the slightly aristocratic aristocrat knew that he was the great musician. By the time he entered the top 20 of the purification sequence, various secrets about the big musicians were also discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex seems to be prepared and calmly said: "This, I got an explanation from Lord St. Sarde, who was the cardinal of the Vaorrit Parish and had a complete understanding of the whole thing. Her Royal Highness Princess Natasha likes the female surname. Lucien Evans is only the props she used to make excuses and cover up. The relationship between the two parties is not so rumored, and Her Royal Highness is also a very devout believer. Her former lover, Syl After Via was known by her to be a magic apprentice, she killed her without any hesitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most beautiful musicians die because of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Dedicated to Silvia" is no wonder that Nata will be Her Royal Highness Princess Shakespe directly rewards a manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the nobles heard this secret, and it was from Sarde who could not lie on this kind of thing. The cardinal, suddenly the audience was stunned, and all kinds of questions in the past were explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Pines and others now feel that they cannot accept Natasha as the Queen, so he coughed a sigh: "The love of the same name violates the teachings of the Lord. And it is impossible to give birth to descendants, and such inheritance is meaningless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is only the preaching of some missionaries, the Lord only teaches us not to indulge in lust, and The problem of the descendants, I want to invite Princess Natasha to the succession of the throne to explain in advance, asking her to give birth to her descendants as soon as possible, as for her private relationship with Wang Fu, the actual lover or lover, we will not Concerned, I believe that this little retreat, she can still make, if not, we will discuss other candidates.” Rex’s bright eyes looked around the members of the House of Lords. “If there are no other questions, we will Let's vote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Sorenfen, one of the conservative leaders, took the lead and raised his hand. He is not as extreme as Rex and prefers one. Acceptable by the church, the parliament, and the nobility Choosing, lest it cause a division of the nobility, a civil war in the kingdom, or a major conflict in the church council, will make the whole Holm kingdom decline, many cities become ruins, and the winning aristocrats will not get much benefit, and Natasha has no The question is such a candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of the Duke of Sorenfen is the "night walker" Winston, his appeal to the conservative aristocracy is no less than Rex, his hand Immediately led to the rise of an arm, and then the aristocrats who supported Rex also raised their hands one by one, and soon reached two-thirds of all the numbers, the Duke of James and the Duke of Russell were sullen, ready to use the Duke Negating the right to make the issue become a current state of emergency, and this state will involve a series of problems, and the conservatives may not be monolithic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the Viscount Harrison remembered something, picked up the quill and wrote a sentence on the paper, then smashed into a group and quietly passed it to the Duke of James. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that he was worried about being overheard by the Golden Knights such as the Duke of Rex, the Duke of James did not blame him for doing more, but carefully unfolding the paper ball and seeing it "The relationship between His Royal Highness Princess Natasha and Lord Hathaway is closer than we thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the Duke of James became complicated and discussed with the Duke of Russell After a while, suddenly raised his arm, which made most of the enlightened aristocrats startled, but still chose to believe them and follow their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex has a smile on his face: "Very good, the aristocratic house voted inviting the violet countess Natasha Vaoliit to Holm Inherited the motion of the throne."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked down the raft and sang in a crisp voice: "This meeting is over."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the conservative aristocrats left, the Duke of James looked at the Viscount Harrison: " I hope that you are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" I can only gamble, and Rex seems to be fully prepared. I will now report the results to the parliament, the highest jury. Make a decision whether to assassinate." Viscount Harrison hurriedly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a secret room at Nexel Palace, Rex respectfully said to the two old men: "His Lord Saint-Salt, Lord Ketonia, according to you Our orders have allowed Princess Natasha to successfully inherit the right to inherit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Thrad smiled flatly, his eyelids hanging down, The turbid eyes are blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 35th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, in the conference room of the highest jury, twenty-four chairs have been lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have discussed this issue before. I don't think it is a good choice to make Beria's students a Holm queen. I recommend removing it in advance. "The soul of the dead, Vicente, said coldly, and didn't look at Hathaway." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared enough Vicente to take himself out of the previous Congos incident and provide sufficient evidence to show that Felipe and others The students did not know the actions of the demon lich and saved them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several top panel members followed the nod and thought that Natasha and Gordon should be assassinated to protect David from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri looked at them coldly: "This is a matter for the Hoffenberg family. Whoever joins me is my deadly enemy. And, I believe that Tasha can become a queen of justice and will not be biased towards the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her poor expression ability is a direct threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how many people support you?" Vicente slammed Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creator" Davy said easily: "I believe Hathaway's judgment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Have your head been eaten by the dog?" Without warning, the storm master began to roar. "Assassinate Natasha, assassinate Gordon, you are going to let Holm, Burrian, Colette, Is the aristocrat of Calais self-defeating? Sald will also wake up when he dreams, when the nobles will completely fall to him! Seven epic knights in four countries, plus the cardinal of the corresponding parish, is ten Two legends, and two are three levels, enough to clamp down on our development!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be snarled, other top panel members are forbearing They lived sideways, but most of them still secretly agreed. Although Fernando had a bad temper, it was difficult to get along with him, and he was a little perverted. However, he always took the development of the parliament as a priority and did not be too biased. He agreed with Heather. Wei, that proves that Hathaway’s description of Natasha is authentic and that the assassination is indeed Causing nobles rally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, what is your opinion?" Douglas smiled and asked, he was the least affected by the roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s bright red eyes looked around at others and made some members dare not look at him: “At least Natasha is not a bad choice.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not bad choice, well, I agree with this statement." Douglas is more willing to believe in Hathaway and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente has a heart to object, but the demigod lich has made him very passive, and his allies are not willing to provide support at this time, so The Supreme Council quickly decided not to stop but closely observe Natasha's inclinations and to destroy or control them if necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the conference room and returning to his study, Fernando saw wearing black Lucien, who is wearing a double-breasted long dress, is walking back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, how is the situation?" Lucien sensed that the teacher came in and quickly turned around and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled and said: "Do not stop Natasha from taking over the throne, but mainly depends on her own wishes, and Vaoli and Holm are separated. Far away, she and her father need to take care of it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he said with a deep heart: “Lu Xien, the teacher can do so much for you. Now, if you can turn the Queen to bed, you have to look at yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled red and smiled and said: " It’s hard, Natasha likes girls.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is a problem...” Fernando took a few steps with his hand, suddenly his eyes Bright, open the space of the half-faced door and walked in, leaving Lu Xien in doubt and standing in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Fernando came out with a beautifully patterned belt and proudly said: "Sure enough, I am the best in alchemy in my youth. Achievement, come, Lucien, wear it, you will soon become a loved one with Natasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
