			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Institute of Atomic Research, Lucien was warmly welcomed by students like Heidi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you are awesome, and you will incorporate Oliver Transform into your system of relativity, so that 'Ether' no longer has value!" Carter Rina said excitedly, the teacher was silent for more than eight months, and it was originally brewing such an epoch-making paper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi said: "Teacher, why don’t you disclose the news, it’s done without a word, we are often affected by those seven or eight months. Electromagnetism, light darkness, the sneer of the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was proposed by his own teacher, and emphasized that the Douglas movement system is a low-speed approximation of this theory, Lei Yili Ya and others accepted almost no resistance. Of course, for the perspective of time and space, they are still in a state of ignorance due to the lack of their own level of arcaneism, but they are confused but not confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond them, Lazar and Roque put their hands in their pockets and smiled at Lucian, Jerome’s holding of "Arcane" seemed to wait Asked, Ophelia, Lowell and other assistants are far away, his face is full of excitement, and he and others are indirectly witnessed a paper that can be on the throne of the Great Arcane, witnessed a paragraph A shocking history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also envy of Heidi, Annick and others in their emotions. They are the students of Mr. Evans, who can comfortably surround him. Celebrate around, you can only be on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this paper come out? Didn’t you see these months of brewing?" Lucien deliberately clarified his own students and When friends encounter other papers in the future, they can think more about why, and don't judge blindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint didn’t know when it was infected with Annick’s habit of scratching his head, and his expressions converge, leaving only the most sincere admiration: “Teacher, you this I don't know much about the paper, but the formula that the mass becomes larger with the increase of speed seems to explain the theoretical and practical mismatch of the electromagnetic cyclotron. Just now I and Annick adjusted the frequency of the electric field change after they calculated, and they really got it. Higher energy particles than ever! Are you getting this paper inspired by this question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Ophelia, etc. With his ears in mind, the "Allinge Impressions" magazine has paid a lot of money to buy the story behind the special theory of relativity, but they also have the consciousness that this kind of thing can finally tell others that they must pass the consent of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, after mastering the classical electromagnetic theory, I tried to incorporate the president’s movement system into it, but there were many problems until the speed of light experiment was given. I am inspired. After an intermediate stage similar to the Oliver transformation, I naturally derived these formulas from as few hypothetical assumptions as possible, and the relativistic effects you found are strong evidence of my theory.” Lucien speaks I have long thought of good words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick is a bit stunned: "At that time, the teacher had a guess about the quality change in your explanation. Heidi also said how this is possible!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freckles on Heidi’s face have disappeared a lot. At this time, the blood is rushing, and Annick’s eyes are anxiously glanced: “How do I know that this is the case? "The field that the surgeon will be involved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are my students, so next, you know." Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This handsome and elegant smile is like the most ferocious devil in the eyes of Heidi and others. The teacher’s intention is to let himself and others understand and master the special theory of relativity. This means making up classes, making up classes and practicing, practicing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing how they were beaten by the hail, Lucien laughed: "The sooner the basic transformation and the perspective of time and space are mastered, the more helpful You are shaping the cognitive world from a higher level without being influenced by the old theory of the past, but one thing to explain in advance is that this concept of time and space is still not perfect. When you study, you should keep in mind that it is very likely that other theories will be introduced in the future. Time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of student who was "tuned" by himself, because the past theory of arcane has not yet formed, it is suitable to accept the new theory, wait a few more In the year, it takes more time to change, and may even be bound by old ideas, and there is no way to create a surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded, Heidi’s emotions recovered, curiously asked: “Teacher, are you going to submit the relativistic effect that Annick found next time? Under the circumstances that it is difficult to fully understand your thesis, the lesser-known electromagnetic and light-dark mage has been arguing that this is only a hypothesis theory. Oh, they will not be hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien did not answer her, but to all humanity: "There is still a lot of imperfections in this paper. You can also join in the discussion of it. We will gradually improve the strength of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the enthusiasm, the 15th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office of an Arcane Review Board, several members of the Pale Hand gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the authority in the field of cell memory in the Necromancer, Felipe was naturally included in the audit committee after becoming a Level 7 Arcanist, with his hands in black In the pocket of the windbreaker, leaning against the wall, watching Pessol, Tina Dimos and other members of the Necromancer say: "I don't know how Evans will respond to the "About some errors and several flaws in relativity" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alvaro was the paper submitted only two days ago. It is very insightful. I think Lucien Evans is too late to answer. It’s almost impossible to see his response next month.” Pesor, after experiencing the vibration of the Quantum and Brooke experiments, said that the particle theory is in a state of confusion, so for Lucien’s The paper did not respond very much. If the "Ether" is gone, then it is gone. As for the subversion of the sports system, Lucien has clearly stated that it is a sublimation, a more comprehensive and less restrictive interpretation, and he has not resisted it. Anyway, for the Necromancer, this is not the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tina Dimos frowned: "I heard that Lucien Evans submitted a paper yesterday, but he should have not had time to be an arcane. Library income, so I can't find it. Although I support Alvaro's opinion, I can only maintain a neutral attitude before I see Lucien's response."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She witnessed the "brainstorm" of last year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has established a real authoritative surname. In the field he is good at, he does not speak, he does not respond, others feel unreliable." Felipe Looked at the badge of the chest, seven black rings, seven silver stars, and Lu Xien is said to have eight silver stars, eight black rings seem to have little difference, but in the hearts of other arcane masters, Lucien has Starting with a few Arcane masters, with the fierce name and authority of the Lord of Hell, this is not directly attributable to the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is not far from the Arcanist, two theories, any perfect or confirmed one, you can get this supreme Arcane title, build it belongs to Your own legendary career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, the latest issue of "Arcane" was sent in, Felipe stood up straight, his hand raised, volley caught a copy, directly When I arrived at the catalogue, I saw that the first one was not "some mistakes about relativity and a few flaws", nor was it the discussion of the special relativity by other arcanists and legendary magicians, but the signature Lucien? Evans? X's "Analysis and Improvement of the Theory of Electromagnetic Cyclotron's Disagreement with Practice and Discussion of the Theory of Relativity". After reading this paper, Tina Dimos sighed deeply: "I don't think Alvaro can wait until next month for Lucien." The official response was."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesol’s face was a bitter smile, and Felipe’s hand in his pocket was tightly held, feeling the gap The bigger it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between him and the teacher of the demigod lich is not close, there is no good feeling, but if there is a chance, he does not mind revenge for him. The reality is so cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Moon League Allinge Division, due to induction The exception in the laboratory, Taling did an emergency treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian, as a member of the Disciplinary Department of the Parliament, arrived at the scene for the first time and saw the headless body lying in front of the cyclotron, as well as the walls and experiments. The red and white "flowers" of the table and the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Alvaro..." Urisian can guess the identity of the body even if he does not look at the badge on his chest. He should be the only one. A high-level magician who knows the collapse of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcaneists who followed were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Yurisian suddenly had an illusion of water in front of the space, and then everything returned to normal, and the laboratory next to it opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
