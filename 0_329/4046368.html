			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansive air and waves mixed with the tumbling flame, engulfed toward Lucien, and the gray slabs paved in the magic tower corridor were picked up by paper. The explosion is deafening and people can't hear anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the turbulent waves rushed to the side of Lucien, they encountered invisible walls, which were blocked by living, and the white gas shining with the fire was Lucy. En is around the bounds and stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Rings Magic "Magic Prison"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavendi, who is traveling with Lucien, is a nine-ring master, and he is the member of the highest-rated jury and one of the tower leaders. Well, even if I am not good at the magic of the stars, there is a corresponding warning spell that is constant on the magic items. Therefore, when the blonde magician looks down with respect and respect, he has a bad premonition, directly inspiring the magic prison, just burning the sun. The blond magician was imprisoned when it appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the explosion is amazing, but it does not have the magical unique surnames such as dissociation. After a few tumbling, it slowly subsides and takes the invisible magic prison. There is no way, and the rumbling sound of the gradual departure seems to bring a deep unwillingness and despair. Even the attack of holding the mortal belief and abandoning everything has no effect? Is it so easy to solve? Can an intermediate magician want to play an assassination in front of a high-ranking magician or a grandmaster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the gray gas that has not disappeared suddenly becomes slow, and the entire area loses all colors, leaving only pure black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely, you can see that the air is still weak, just a lot slower than just. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic "Time to stop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donald’s hoarse voice came: “You leave there first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lavin is different, and he is good at the magic of the stars. He explores the stars and the tombs all the year round. The fortune of the main star of destiny is extremely sensitive. If the "time stop" is difficult and unreasonable, and there is no way to resolve the principle, even if it has been constructed in the soul, the start-up time is one to two seconds slower than the normal magic. He does not need Lavindi to display the "magic prison". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has some doubts, and does not quite understand what Donald means, obviously the explosion has been blocked by the "magic prison", he also spent a lot of time "stopping time" doing what? However, seeing Raven all retreating, Lucien also quickly did it, and Barak returned to this moment and hurriedly stopped in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps back, Morris mouth suddenly appeared in the inexplicable mantra, it seems to ring in everyone's heart, let people burst into dizziness. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Morris was ready, Donald interrupted the second two seconds before the end of the time, the waves were re-rolling, but a translucent silhouette was invisible. Power pulled out from the waves and the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine Rings Necromancer Magic "Bound Soul"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the lower-order magical array of similar names, it can bind and imprison the soul that has not yet been completely dissipated, unless it is extremely good at Necromancer Otherwise, you must use a spell to match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vaguely visible soul of the blonde magician’s face was pulled into a flaming ruby ​​with mourning, and it was dyed with a layer of secluded Green light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the Archmage, don’t say assassination, even if you want to die, it’s not that easy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find out what is going on." Morris held the "soul gem" and walked to Lucien. "You have nothing to do?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Although Lucien often feels calm, sensitive, and extremely responsive, but in front of the three Masters, it still seems quite slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Gaston, Florenta and other elements that have not yet left will also come to this side, one is concerned about Lucien, and the other is Want to figure out what happened, the high level of the elemental will was assassinated at the headquarters of the elemental will? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must investigate clearly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep? Including Lucien, Morris, Donald, Lavendi and others all looked at him in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellak has a serious expression and speaks very fast: "Several lords, ladies and gentlemen, the goal of this blonde magician is very clear, that is Evans. Commissioner! He seems to be due to the discovery of new particles, causing the cognitive world to break and solidify, and there is no way to upgrade the level of magic, so in desperation, I intend to bring Evans members together to destroy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In such an event, the Correctional Department has handled a lot in the past few hundred years, and there is nothing to be shocked, but the question is why he can grasp the time so accurately. Just a few minutes from the end of the meeting, I came out of the half-face warehouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor where the blonde magician came is only a half-face warehouse, no other room to hide, Moreover, this layer is heavily guarded and does not allow detention. If he leaves the semi-level warehouse in advance and ambushes at the corner, he has long been discovered by the magic array, patrol magic, etc., to "clean up". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In summary, I think that at least one element of the will is working with him! To ensure the safety of Evans, please, gentlemen, Ladies should not be close, lest they be found by the real mastermind! No one can guarantee that the mastermind will cherish life and not make a joint destruction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When you hear Bellak, the high-level elements of the elements will look at each other with surprise. From the perspective of time, such an inference is very reasonable. Who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, they are faintly divided into three circles, guarding each other, only Lavin is angry and roaring: "This is a shame of the will of the element!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Lavindi, Lord Donald, Lord Morris, please investigate the incident as soon as possible. Evans is not suitable to stay here, I will Escort him back to Allinge.” Bellak made his own suggestion. It seems that he believes that the three great mages who had just shot, especially those who have a bad temper but are impulsive and upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the high-level elements of the high level of the road, except for Lucien, are at least high-level magicians. If there is a traitor among them, they must have a mages to sit down. Guaranteed not to cause big losses, so Donald, who was going to leave, nodded to Morris: "Let's deal with it, the magician of Ravendi and the disciplinary department sent Evans back to Allinge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the entire magic tower suddenly violently swayed, and there were explosions coming from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Not good! The core of the magic tower!" Morris's face changed slightly, his hands stretched out into the space in front of him, and a secret illusion door with countless rune patterns Come out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy black door that was rusted was pulled open by Morris, stepped into it, and disappeared into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic "precise transmission"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a transfer within a kilometer range, and it works better in its own magic tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aesthetic Evans is to draw our attention?" Donald said to himself, wanting to command the elements of the high-level alert, and worried Among them, the possible traitors took the opportunity to escape, so they said to Lavin: "You control the center to open the second level of the magic tower defense, and prevent other places from being destroyed. I will investigate the assassination."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two legendary magicians, only the president and vice president have the authority to open up to three levels of defense in the Royal Tower of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading Raven, he looked at Bellak again with stern eyes: "You escorted Evans back to Allinge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge is a city of the sky that has been carefully arranged by the Magic Council for hundreds of years. Even the mid-level magician can send it freely through the magical array that covers the whole city. It was discovered at a time that it was much safer than the Holm Royal Tower, which the traitor had not yet found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Allinge and Lucian’s teacher storm dominated your ruling guard, unlike the elements of the two giants who are busy each other – Hathaway recently went out, Davy is addicted to creating a new kind of metamorphosis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
