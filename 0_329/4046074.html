			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left the Hall of the Holy Ghost at 11 o'clock in the evening, only sporadic lights can be seen nearby, and most of the carriages in the dark are gone. open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest month is hot during the day, but as long as it rains, it will be very cool at night, and it will be blown by this clear night wind. Zhen, waking up from the success of Victor's concert and the unexpected surprise of Quintal, while strolling and thinking: "It seems that I have to leave the Adejan district in a short time, and the laboratory must be cleaned first. In case of being vacant, you will find problems by the tramp, etc., and you will summon the grievances early, preferably tonight! Start to concentrate on buying moonlight roses tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moonlight Rose is a magical plant that assists the Cavaliers to arouse the blood power. The growth of the environment is very strict, the output is not high, and the best way to become a knight is to become a poor, ordinary people become aristocratic class, people who need it A lot, so even if the price is expensive, it is often in short supply, and even the aristocrats can completely digest it. The average person can only buy it from the black market by luck or more ridiculous price. The best way is to become a certain person. Guests attendants, and other forces have the ability to stimulate blood obtained after Knight's reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight resources of the Vaurit duchy are concentrated in the hands of the church, the Violet family and several other families, in addition to their high ranks and strong family knights, This is one of the reasons why they are the most powerful family in the Principality of Vaoli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien called her to Felice, a member of the Haien family, a niece of the Earl of Hein, although her father even had moonlight The help of magical drugs such as Rose did not stimulate blood power, and failed in the struggle for the title. The relationship with Earl of Hein was very poor, but it did not prevent her from having the qualification to purchase the moonlight roses inside the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Felice has already purchased, but after three failed to stimulate the blood, I can only concentrate on the music road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The question is how to convince her? And how to dispel her doubts about my purchase of moonlight roses!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien walked down the steps of the St. Hall with a touch of trouble, the last time the watchman stopped, let Lucien have a lingering fear, must speed up the strength, if Felice does not agree, he can only take risks Go to the black market in Aalto or join a secret gathering in the magic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance to the St. Mary's Hall, only two ordinary carriages were parked there, and Joel said with a red face to Eliza, John and Alina that they always felt Lucian is very musical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien coming over, Joel haha ​​laughed and reached out and hugged Lucien firmly: "Little Evans, you have been Since the musicians dream, my dreams of the holy hall have been realized, this is a dreamy night. You are your father and our pride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Joel had just joked that Lucien had a musician's dream, since Lucine began to learn music with Victor, Joel felt that Lucien might really want to be a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien was hugged, he couldn’t help but secretly said, "Can you not hug, it is really uncomfortable for this kind of etiquette, how good is the handshake!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer hugged, John also gave Lucien a hug, he was a little excited, and the power seemed great: "Lu Xien, you are a musical genius. I am proud of you. I thought I would be a knight first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, Lucien’s heart moved slightly, maybe he could use John. When the reason is to find Felice to buy Moonlight Rose, after all, after success, I also want to help benefactors, help good friends to stimulate blood, always enjoy people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien originally had this plan, that is, after he had some wealth, he tried to buy Moonlight Rose and helped John become a knight, because after crossing, Joe The family is like a true loved one, and after a few things, it is the same. In their own minds, their position is more important than Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is what to convince Felice, money or something else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just started, at least after two or three years of stability, can be called a musician, maybe you can quickly stimulate the blood to become a knight. Lucien smiled and answered John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stimulating blood flow, the first time is the highest success rate, and then every time it will fall. After three times, unless you get several special, sequelae, you will never succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena stood by and saw that Lucien was separated from John before she hugged Lucien and smiled: "Congratulations on your success." , Lucien, no, it’s your name, Mr. Evans.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We are friends, don’t be so cautious, or I will not guide you in music. Learned," Lucien responded jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative district to the Adejan district, although there are also gates, but generally do not close, but there are soldiers guarding, after sending away Elena, Lucien Just returned to his hut with the Joel family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in bed, all emotions calm down, Lucien Half When I fell asleep until the early morning, I climbed up and checked it carefully. I silently entered my magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an hour, on the table with a lot of special alchemy arrays, Lucien used a sterling silver dagger to engrave several magic traps. Only take a tube of dark red blood from the box in the corner with the "Save Organs" magic, and open the magic notebook on the table next to the Soul Library, so that you can record the grievances at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Wraith Dust is the main purpose of Lucien, but it’s normal to study this undead by the way, and it’s almost soul, right Its research helps Lucien to strengthen his own soul and understand the magic of the dead spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the glass test tube engraved with the magic rune, a thick sulphur smell floats out, dark red blood like a magma, rolling out red bubbles from time to time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recites the hard-spoken mantra, the mental power is connected with a certain alien space, and then the blood of the devil is sprinkled forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red blood stopped in the air and split into a drop of blood at an incredible rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drop of blood quickly formed a small, bloody and evil-smelling magical array that evaporates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pale red blood fog, a transparent figure appears, its hands, feet and face are very blurred, only the thick resentment and viciousness can be clear I feel it, even see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I still don’t understand the principle of space here, the construction of apprenticeship magic is relatively simple. Lucien has gone through many virtual exercises, “summon low The undead creatures are successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost no clear face of the transparent figure just appeared, a mouth, it seems to make a sharp and harsh call, and slammed toward Lucien Come, it seems to feel the life of hatred that makes you hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not panic, the magic trap started, the air around the wraith became disordered, and it was tied like a rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "binding" apprenticeship magic that is dedicated to the bound spirit, but it has a corresponding high-level version that can transform the knight into a kind of The undead creatures of the corpse of the corpse receive the undead creature's surname on the basis of retaining the original strength and intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the screams are coming out, a transparent ring-shaped wall appears around the wraith, and you can see a ripple of sound oscillating on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trap of the apprentice-level magical arrangement "silence barrier". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the screams of the grievances were offset by the silencer barrier, Lucian did not have direct contact, but still felt a nausea and a slight vomiting sensation. "Listen" to a screaming voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scream of the grief, with a certain intensity but not high infrasound, penetrates the surname, has certain damage to the human body, can not be directly heard." Sean resists discomfort and instantly records the characteristics of the wraith attack on the magic notes in the soul library. "The sound of this frequency seems to make people feel the spiritual illusion and feel that they 'listen' to the grievance Call, some special, you need to write down the approximate range of fluctuation frequencies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
