			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boiled Ocean". !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Lord" Gonheim’s thoughts immediately reflected on his actions, the darkness contracted, and there seemed to be countless electric lights that could not be seen by the naked eye. The flash, which constitutes a dense network of dark ice, attempts to completely cover up the protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this process, the "storm" of "Ms. Snow" is desperately entangled with the darkness, so that it cannot be recovered smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of snow fell, freezing the boiling melt, freezing all the creatures that were contaminated by them, "Ms. Ice" has used the power of its own demon core For the demon king who prefers chaos rather than conspiracy, the opportunity to kill the deadly enemy and integrate the dark and cold forces to promote the demon prince must be controlled at all costs and completely destroyed by the desire to kill, destroy and devour. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s desperate to make the power of the “Dark Lord” Gonheim shrink less smoothly, and the sacred curse of “Furious Storm” and “Star Heaven” The text has already rang over the boiling ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" In the inner curse, Gonheim made the most sensible choice, and the body inside "Frozen Fortress" suddenly became illusory, absolutely big. Part of the power is infused into its own "boiling ocean" projection, because whether it is a few legendary magicians, or Natasha, the epic knight holding the "Sword of Truth", has to follow the "projection" damage or even kill The ability to lose your own body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the right hand of the nail black has become dark, like the horror that sticks out from the deepest and deepest darkness, as if it can freeze everything. The cold avatar's "Ms. Snow Lady" also solidified in the air, the diffuse blizzard, the floating snow and ice crystals, briefly turned into a statue of ice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the defense is not important at this time, the "dark Lord" Gonheim can completely win the pursuit, and the "Ms. Snow Lady" will be hit hard, let it fall and retreat. You can only choose the same! Br 啪啪啪 那 那 那 那 那 那 那 那Re-emergence of growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the cold and darkness was completely destroyed by the “luxury cracking”, but it only destroyed several layers of defense and failed to completely strip the layer of darkness. The Lord's "Gonheim's other spell-like effects. Destroy its extraordinary items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare situation of "luxury big cracking" that does not let the "enemy and me cry", as a "devil prince", "legendary peak", Gonheim's magic resistance is very high, can exempt most of the "luxury big crack" effect, and here is the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whirlwind of the whistling wind plunged the dark right hand into it, inside it is a flash of electric light giant tree, surrounded by stars rising up and boiling over the ocean It has become an innocent starry sky, a vast starry sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars are lined with mysterious trajectories, with a ray of light, almost at the same time in the hands of the "Dark Lord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm blasted, the fire tree silver flower, the dark giant hand drips out a drop of black liquid with a horrible low temperature, and everything that it encounters will condense It becomes an ice cube, as if it could not melt ice for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the attack of the three legendary peaks, under the restraint of the two demon kings, the layered defense of the "dark Lord" Gonheim was finally broken. I was hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, it took most of the power of the ontology in time, which was difficult to block this round of attacks, otherwise it would not only be slightly injured · But suffered a heavy blow, even a degenerate ending! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "grey fortress" of the gray sky, "the undead master" Apsis waved his "death python" and brought everything away, The meaning of the harvest of life is immersed in the "frozen fortress" in the endless death power tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t control its shape, the illusion of a few hundred meters tall is more magnificent than the frozen fortress, and the “death python” that is longer than its body It is also to make the frozen fortress like a pocket sculpture in the art gallery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand of a nail black has to stick out from the fortress and block the giant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sorrowful resentment in the frozen fortress, and a huge injury appeared in Gonheim’s huge left hand. The blue and almost dark blood continued to drip out. Created a lifeless layer of ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of most of the forces to deal with Douglas, Lucien = Evans and other legendary magicians and epic knights, in their own home "freeze In the fortress, the "Dark Lord" was also extremely weak, and he could barely block the attack of the "death monarch" Apsis, and suffered a minor injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appsis is indifferent, and the empty eyes are burning with a pale flame without temperature, no matter what it is, this time, its demon nature Still reflected a little, so its offensive is getting more and more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s left eye is pure red as a gemstone, and a ray is shot from it, hitting Gonheim again without anything. Dark right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red ray flashed, and the icy darkness could not completely freeze it, and it penetrated the past and hit the back of the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it seems that in the crisp voice that sounds throughout the abyss, Gonheim’s right out is a half-through wound, and the hot temperature will be very cold. Fusion, let the skin! The skin is black! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the defenses in Gonheim being destroyed and hurt, Lucien added the "revenge gaze" of "the hand of uncertainty" A good result! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight paralysis of the right hand did not affect Gonheim’s actions. As the “Dark Words” sounded, it seemed as if there were countless tiny electric lights and dense cold and dark again. Emerging, timely blocking the "Sword of Truth" that Natasha swayed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, under the double attack of the recovered "Millennium Snow" and "Frozen Fortress" and "Lord of Undead", "Dark Lord" Goethe Mum also lost his initiative and fell into a short-term downturn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can't drag it anymore, you have to pay some price and return to 'the frozen fortress, otherwise I can't stop Douglas, Fernando, Hathaway, Lucien = Evans, Natasha = Waorit, Ms. Ice Snow's siege!" As the most deceitful demon, Gonheim quickly made a decision, such a lineup, enough to be with a class not at home. God fights into a tie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just emerging, but it’s just like seeing the innocent starry sky dissipating itself. The stars of the hustle and bustle are disintegrating, and the storm and lightning of the plundering are gradually subsiding. The "park" of the gathering and the beautiful figure are faint and illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"False?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the power of the past is indeed the power of the legendary peak." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...··· The half-face of the ceremonial summons? Is there a quick ritual? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas in the mind of Gonheim, no matter what the reason, it only knows one thing, he was deceived by Lucien = Evans !!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short-term mistakes, it was once again hurt by the "Lord of Undead", Apsis, and was suppressed by Ms. Snow.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction, it saw Lucien and Natasha smiling and looking at themselves. The figure gradually became illusory, one took off the black top hat and put it on the chest, thank you The appearance, a smile, and a courtesy of the knight's etiquette.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures disappeared, flashing at the end of the "boiling ocean", directly into the chaos Starry sky.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! "Gonheim's annoyance and anger emerged at the same time. I wanted to block it. But it was suppressed by Ms. Ice and Death and the death monarch. Because of the relationship between injury and distraction, it seems that there is no possibility of regaining the upper hand within 30 seconds. And for the two legends, it is enough to find its core in a plane!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, there is not enough time to stop Lucien from letting it An unprecedented loophole in the plan!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
