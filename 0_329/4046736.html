			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the mist, leaving a piece of gold faintly changing on the different greens, setting off a "natural home" flourishing dream. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian and Feili wear the other members of the "visit group", follow Ellerstin, Exeter, walk under the tree house, A bit of a bold or shy elf stared, their pointed ears swaying slightly, and the leaves were woven and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, you have lived here during this time, don't arbitrarily arbitrarily, some elves are not friendly to humans." Ellerstin refers to A small grove of dozens of large trees is said to have enough tree houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to her words, Aphrodite licked his tail, a serious and authentic: "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds very clear, some elves are only unfriendly to humans, it seems that they can go around and collect some souvenirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian smiles at Elstin: "His Royal Highness, please also give me the list of demonized devils."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all in the 'captivity' near the Elf Tree, are you going to investigate now?" Exxon agrees with the positive attitude of the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulyss shakes his head and shook his head: "In this case, Lord Evans will definitely check it out. We are still going around the forest and asking about these fallen elves." Friends, understand the specific situation, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiles and ends up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin nodded gently: "I will give you the information of the fallen elves and their friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best to mark the ones who have the most contact with them before the fall." Felipe, who was inserted next to him, added that although this seems to be an infection caused by the abyss, it cannot be ruled out before the investigation is clear. Maybe, otherwise it will be easily blinded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion’s face changed slightly, and then he couldn’t help but nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his guilty conscience, but the most normal reaction of any elf executive after he heard Felipe’s words. He suspected that there was a problem inside the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun, Felipe’s face is very similar to the vampire who has not been out in the coffin for many years, but he did not explain that this is a normal investigation process. Let Ecristo and Ellestin guess, maybe someone can't hold their breath and take the initiative to jump out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Annick, Sprint took the list and marked the location to the southeast of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ulmer, a good friend of the fallen elf Kelly..." Annick read the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of both men and women, his face is difficult to contain red, so he quickly lost a "mechanized mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint glanced at him: "Is this shy? We are investigators, naturally in a proactive position, they should be nervous!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel uneasy when I meet strangers, I can't control my emotions." The red tide on Annick's face faded, his eyes became cold and ruthless, like a steel Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint snorted: "Is it awkward? You are too unconfident, what is wrong, what is wrong, is something that is often there." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worried to give them a bad impression? It’s so funny, we don’t know if we can come to Stroop Forest again, you’re doing something very embarrassing. How? And your shy cramps make the other party feel bader than anything that is humiliating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been criticized for Annick’s surname. This time, he accepted Heidi’s “delegation” and helped Annick to be more confident and bolder, so that he could better face the teacher and put the debate on arcane aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may not be the case. The word "suffocation" invented by the teacher has been recognized. Sprint is looking at the past with a voice, and sees a beautiful elf with a melon face coming, her black hair, silver skin, Dressed in simple leaves, holding a harp in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and down, Sprint secretly told Annick: "There are elves who are watching you, don't let go of this opportunity, or else you The surname is destined to be single in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and asked his friend: "This lady, I don't know what to call you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a male surname." The beautiful, pointed, soft ears of the elf seem to be no stranger to this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone’s face became very ugly even with a “mechanized mind”, and Sprint’s facial muscles twitched: “You are a male surname Do you still say that you like boys best?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful elf shakes the harp in his hand, the temperament of a poet: "Love doesn't matter." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick pulled Sprint a hand and resisted discomfort and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that the materials in the Arcane Library say that the elves have a long life and a leisurely life, so they love art and have all sorts of strange special preferences..." Sprint deeply regretted and feared, and almost pushed his friends into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick still has the answer in the future, the beautiful elf behind him smiled and said: "Right, I haven’t introduced myself yet, I am Ulmer, just listen. Are you reading my name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the moon elf, with outstanding hearing, especially when the wind is down in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ulmer?" Sprint and Annick stopped and didn't look back very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ulmer, we have something to ask you." In the end, Annick, who had blessed the "mechanized mind," asked "courage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulmer smiled and said: "Two, what do you think of the lyre? Does human improvement of the harp lose the most essential thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Annick and Sprint are speechless, their teachers are big musicians, but they follow him to learn arcane and magic. , not music! This kind of professional music problem, they can't even find directions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulmer shook his head in a sigh: "If you don't understand art, we can't be friends, not friends, we can't talk happily, you guys Do you have any opinion on wax figures? I recently bought one and it feels very interesting. Do you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Sprint and Annick are stunned again Suddenly, I feel that my usual life is too "style". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand wax figures? Hey, lost civilization? I heard that the Magic Council found a relic of steam civilization?" Ulmer said disappointedly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Annick, Sprint also sighed at the same time, discussing history and lost civilization is the specialty of every arcian, otherwise Ways to take risks and identify things, and this ruin was discovered by his own teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a pleasant conversation, Ulmer finally relaxed: "Do the two guests come to ask about Gloria?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we want to know if there are any signs of abnormality before he fell?" Annick relieved and asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulmer's long, well-proportioned hand pulled two times on the strings, bringing out beautiful notes, and stunned: "Everything is fine, Kellet He also said that he learned a special dance, prepared to show it to me, and the result... he was degraded and demonized..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is gradually low, close silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special dance?" Annick was shy and shy, but his name was cautious and delicate, and he did not let go of any clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
