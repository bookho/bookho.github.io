			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the VIP restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long table has a candlestick on each side of the table, and the swaying dim candle reflects the warmth of the room, and the soothing melodious music played by the indoor band is hard to say. Romance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not a rude, unruly ugly man in front of Granny, then everything is perfect." Grace carefully picked up the red caviar In the entrance, then looked up and looked at Granny, the puffy face, the scary hair, the ugly and sly appearance suddenly made her feel sick, even if the ordinary fat man is better than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gryneuve pinches his thin cups and feet, revealing a smile that he thinks is fascinating: "Greece, your temperament is more than your appearance." People admire, especially when you play the piano quietly. Is every girl with good musical talent so charming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace almost done When you vomit, you can have a strong sigh in your heart. Although Granny is over forty years old, it is the great rich man in the city of Stewart, and the great nobility with the Viscount Wright. With deep friendship, he is a powerful man with wealth. Being chased by such a man, even if she is not heart-warming, is enough to show off and be proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the name of Mr. Evans’s student, with the identity of 'musician', the men who used to look at me have started to surround me. The side... It’s a common problem for every man to conquer.” Grace thought with a smile, “Thank you for your compliment, Mr. Granny.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she wiped her mouth with a white napkin: "Sorry, I went to the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she stood up, she stayed The Griffin guard at the door stepped forward: "Miss Grace, the waiter informed us that the bathroom in the small restaurant suddenly had a problem, you can only go downstairs."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granius is slightly angry and said: "How can it be a problem? What is the restaurant person doing?" He is actually the owner of this restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Grinoff, it doesn't matter, no one wants to accident, and there is not much downstairs." Grace uses "musicians" Self-cultivation" answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granius praised the nod: "Gress, I think you are more attractive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Grace tightly shuts up, only responds with a smile, lest he should spit it out, and then, in the small restaurant waiter, go to the bathroom on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door is a full-length mirror, and in front of the mirror are two sinks. This arrangement makes it easy for women to apply makeup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gross from the ladies' washroom on the left, standing in front of the sink to make up the makeup. Looking at her radiant self, she couldn't help but gently pick up the cheerful melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This melody is like her mood at this time, after a long trek, hard-fought Aalto music festival tour, her life becomes like Dreams, money, glory, praise and pursuit that have never been thought of before are overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make up the makeup, Grace is whispering to the charming and touching person in the mirror: "At this time last year, you still have a good-looking and bleak future. Hands, relying on the savings saved by my father, mother and brother, I hope to go to Aalto to complete my dream journey. This time, you are already a tulip of Stourke, a promising musician, and changed his family three. The villas on the floor, chased by many nobles and businessmen, lived a life that was previously unimaginable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grace, you remember, it’s all because You are the best one in the band to learn piano and play the piano, so it is you, not Piola, not Sharon, not Green and Leicester. They are on this position. You can't be confused by life, forget you. The music and the piano."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, her mouth moved silently: "It’s all because you met the talented musician, and now Life is like a flower on the edge of a cliff. The more beautiful it is, the more dangerous it is. "This kind of worried about her often thrown, may soon be overshadowed fantastic beautiful life, in happy joy awaiting trial advent of paralysis, just as now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her body immediately became stiff, her expression was an indescribable fear, and the bag in her hand fell to the ground, giving a soft response to the collision of the bottle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Mr. Evans." Although she knew that she should pretend not to see it at this time, she covered her face and walked out of the bathroom, then took her parents. The relatives waited far away from Sterk, but the long-awaited nightmare finally came, making her feel as if she was in endless fear, no matter how the body or her mouth lost control, and her teeth screamed like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went to another sink, picked up the water in the reservoir and poured it into it, smiling slightly: "Gross, hello, I just saw that you almost didn't know, your change is really big. Oh, it will always make people look good when they dress up and feel good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan Mr. Si, I didn’t expect you to come to Stourke, there was no newspaper report!” Gris suppressed the fear a little, smiled stiffly, and screamed insanely. “He never knows! He must not be present now. Know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned to look at her: "When it comes to newspapers, I think of the "Sturker", which has About yours..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows...he knows..." In the eyes of Grace, only Lucien’s lips moved, she couldn’t hear. What he said next, then blackened in front of him, and he would fall down in one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she felt a strong arm holding her shoulder until she stood firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at Lucien in front of him. Gerry’s face was white and his body trembled and pleaded: “Mr. Evans, I should not pretend to be your student. It’s my own greed, I can’t stand the hardship of life. Please forgive me, I will apologize and clarify in the “Sturker newspaper” tomorrow.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, her whole body strength seems to have been thoroughly cleaned, if it is not holding the sink, fearing that it will fall directly to the ground, because once she reports, all her identity and status All the money and the pursuit will disappear, not only will become ordinary, unattended musicians, but will also be spurned and despised by countless people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she also understands that only a sincere and thorough apology can avoid more serious consequences at this time, such as being involved in urban prisons for fraud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gentle and laughed: "Gress, you can pretend to be my piano student for so long without being seen, enough to prove that you have a good piano talent, So I am very curious, why don't you rely on yourself, but take risks and take the road that is bound to be exposed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Lussian not only did not roar, but instead Gentlely asking the reason, Grace's tears flowed out, and she also felt that she seemed to have a chance, so she cried and replied: "I was born in an ordinary civilian family, in order to let me learn music, let me Going to Alto to chase music dreams, parents and relatives spent a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After returning from Aalto, we were only planning to use Mr. Evans to guide you. The opportunity of our Fantasia music took the first step in the music path, but for the first time we used the famous performance of Mr. Evans to achieve unexpectedly great success. The praise, the money, the pursuit, etc. came one after another. Our eyes, It’s that we have the idea of ​​pretending to be your student.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“At this time, my parents were unable to turn around because of money, and the small business went bankrupt and was taken to the city. The court is about to be put in jail, so I have no other choice, I agree with their proposal, and I am the one who is best at the piano, pretending to be your student, Mr. Evans. After that, I am swept into the swamp and I can no longer extricate myself. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace's red eyes stared at Lucien's face and prayed: "Mr. Evans, don't know how you can forgive me?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she gritted her teeth firmly and said: "I want you to do what I want!" As long as you can get forgiveness from Mr. Evans, even if you let yourself be conservative It is also possible to exchange with the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a month of such a dreamy life, Grace understands that she does not want to go back to the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw that he was making good progress and didn’t want to break the sewer of the VIP restaurant. He nodded gently: “Your experience is understandable, but deceived. It’s always bad behavior.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
