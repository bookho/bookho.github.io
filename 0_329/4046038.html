			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the fluorescent light, this sparkling thing shone with a faint light blue glow in the water ash, and Lucien walked over and carefully used the dagger. Pick it up and find it is a silver-white ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring has a simple hollow pattern, the metallic color is emitted in the simple, and the light blue unnamed gem is half-sized in the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the ring on the finger of the water ghost?" Lucian speculated, bending over and picking up the ring, rubbing his finger with his finger Inner layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold metal touch came, and the inner layer of the ring was inscribed with a circle of text. Lucien carefully identified it as a lingua franca: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People are often colder than ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ring looks ordinary, but When you look closely, you will feel the light blue light flowing in the mysterious deep color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds the mentality of trying it out, smoothing the soul that is hurt by the magical counterattack, and slowly regaining the spiritual power of recovering a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just contacted with the light blue gems on the ring, Lucien’s slightly injured soul swayed awkwardly, feeling the snow inside the jewel In the air, the snow and snow hides the spell structure that is far more complicated than informal magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed with a sigh, with joy and a little relaxation: "Really a magic ring, I don't know how many levels, it seems to be better than Benjamin. The sacred emblem of truth is a bit more complicated. Perhaps this is the reason why this water ghost will mutate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking inside, Lucien will be almost dry Spiritual recovery, in this state, there is no way to resolve the approximate magic structure of this ring, it can not be left in the core of the magic array to drive, can only be resolved after the mental strength is restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien has become a formal magician and learned a magical "identification", then you can directly identify all the first-level magic items, if knowledge Accumulate a little more, and even identify the second- and third-level magic items, so that you don't need to slowly analyze the magic structure, you can easily learn the information, and you can save it without the spiritual mark. In the case of direct imprinting of their spiritual mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most magic items are often sealed with information left by the producer to help users understand the usefulness of the magic item, the reason for the production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as the Lucian grade grows, the "identification" will also become stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the witch’s record, the magician is very lazy in the classification of the items, directly referring to the classification of the magic, simply dividing the magic items into apprentice magic items, once Nine-level magic items, as well as legendary magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criterion for classification is that the effect produced is equivalent to which ring magic, or which level of knight's ability, and in the same level of magic items, there is also simple The low, medium, high and perfect fourth-order difference, for example, if the ring seals the three-ring magic "lightning" once a day, it is a three-level low-level magic item, if it seals three times a day "lightning", it is In the middle stage, if you add some other auxiliary surnames, such as effectively weakening the lightning damage by 5% to 10%, etc., it is a third-level high-level magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is some kind of magic effect, it will be upgraded to the original level. For example, a magic item is constant equal to the eight-ring magic "spirit barrier" effect. The "immunity of any method of detecting and influencing the mind", then it is a nine-level perfect magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the level of magical swords, armor, etc., it is basically the same as the attacking or defensive power of the same level knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the general structure and information of this ring have not yet been resolved, Lucien dare not wear it, just put it in his own pocket. Because if it is the kind of thing that produces magic effects when worn, this magic effect is often a curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving the first magic item in his life, Lucien looked up with joy and saw the rumor and body full of corpses and blood. Suddenly, I got to work hard, I have to be good at it and deal with the scene. Of course, the most important thing is to take out the brain tissue of this mutant water ghost:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the name of this informal magic is "storing organs", it can actually keep most of the items fresh, and the effect of each spell is twenty-four hours, no need for casting materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cut the skull of the water ghost with a dagger and saw the dark black brain tissue inside, which is like hiding a lot of bugs. It squirmed slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the strange scene that makes people feel cold, Lucien took out the cryolite bag and carefully loaded the water brain tissue. They can be used to apply frost rays, and there is no doubt that they have a certain preservation effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, understand that Lucy, who needs a lot of money for magic, is careful about the greed of money, and robs all the money on his body, including the dark river. The two disgusting horrible bodies that had lost their brains, a total of thirty-three silver narts and fifty-two copper fairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the most contribution from the old man in the mission, one person has contributed twenty-five silveraires to some copper fairs, and Jackson’s gangster has four A silver nart six copper fair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the silver coins and copper coins flashing with lovely money, the money bag is bulging, and Lucien can't help but lift his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the process of searching for the purse, Lucien found that he was often confused when he saw things, his ears had signs of hard of hearing, his head was slightly dizzy, and his pain was faint. Walking, there is a feeling of stepping on a thick carpet, and then I understand that my soul is subjected to the anti-phasing damage of the forced interruption of magic, and the witch's magical pharmacy, except for those, the rest belong to the apprenticeship. If you can't heal the wounds of the soul, you will probably have to recover for a while. During this time, the spell will definitely be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting the coins and changing a clean dagger, Lucien began to do heavy physical labor and throw the bodies into the dark river one by one. And they used the long scorpion to send them out of the big hole under the barbed wire and sent them to the Belem River, just like the bodies that Jackson and Ska had dealt with before. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the heart, intestines, liver and other organs that Ska fell, Lucien resisted nausea and retching, and found them in a rag. Wrapped up, also sent to the Belém River, their bloody smell, I believe that will soon attract the mermaid-like guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, Lucien actually got used to it, and even played the kidneys of Skar, and felt that he had a style of black magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood on the road, Lucien was wiped clean with a wet rag, and then found a broken can with some water to rinse it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there are no obvious traces left, Lucien washes his hands and tears off the clothes that have been scratched, and wraps his right hand. The place where the flame burns, then walks to the ramp at the corner, and the current sewer can no longer be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The generation of water ghosts does not seem to be due to cults, although they 'provide' the body, but what is it?" Lucien walked carefully. While thinking about the water brain tissue in your pocket, "Right, do the red-eye mice have any relationship with the cult, or the same reason as the water ghost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of the red-eyed mouse, the witch has not figured out, Lucien now recalls, can not help but think in the direction of the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up early tomorrow, before going to the music association, first go out to the home of Sir Wien to find John, and tell him about someone preaching." For a while, Lucien thought about what to do tomorrow, and watched it carefully and carefully out of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien took the sulphur powder in his hand and sprinkled it around his body, which not only masked his breath with a strong smell of sulphur, but also It is possible for cults and gangsters who are likely to come to follow the sulphur taste to track themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the identity of the magic apprentice and the fact that the Barents River is full of water ghosts outside the barbed wire, Lucien can’t go directly to the church to report, and can’t go out of the city by the Belém River. Near the Wien Jazz Manor, you can only erase and confuse the traces as much as possible. In your own house, you will be innocent passers-by, while restoring your mental strength, while waiting for the dawn with high alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
