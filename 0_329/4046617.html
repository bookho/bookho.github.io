			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa on the outskirts of Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concentrated by Black, according to the formula given by Lucien, carefully and carefully calculated the problem of the morning star approaching the extra precession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lucia’s deliberate pause, his feather pen kept on rustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he looked up and his eyes were shocked and unbelievable, then rushed to the study and rummaged through the arcane and magic books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a magician who is good at the astrology and the force field. The observations of this extra precession are not so clear, only a slight impression, but these micro The impression was like a fire burning in his heart, burning him unable to control himself, burning his brain full of blood and swelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calculated results seem to be very close to the observations in the impression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the arcane and magic book was taken by him, and he took a look at it and left it. Finally, he found the enlightenment book in the distant memory— - "Fifty difficult questions about the star system"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling and opening the page, he followed the catalogue to see the question that the morning star’s near-precession observations do not match the Douglas celestial movement theory predictions— - page 39". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the paper flipped, Black saw the eye-catching data at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the hard-shell book fell on the carpet, making a dull sound, and Black’s gaze was standing in the same place, like a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are so close, what does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the voice of Lucien in the magic radio came out again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" , we can get the morning star near the point of the extra precession is ... This is basically consistent with the observed value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to have a powerful magic, let the solidification sluggish Black's wake up, ecstasy and excitement poured into his heart, his face muscles twisted to a terrible degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the interpretation of the essence of gravity has theoretical support, but also the phenomenon is confirmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean Lucien? Mr. Evans's general theory of relativity is by far the closest theory to gravitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that it is not unsolvable for the Speaker of the Speaker to let the many Arcians become confused and embarrassed, and it is not necessary to introduce any supreme existence to be self-consistent! Lucien? Mr. Evans’s genius-like idea gives an explanation that completely transcends the times and imaginations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that there is nothing wrong with the road to arcane, and there may be many problems that have not been resolved, but we are always on the way to solving the problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I basically don’t understand Lucien’s general theory of relativity, it does not prevent some of the conclusions in the Black application from deriving calculations, and does not prevent him from believing this according to such facts. The theory can explain the nature of gravity, and does not prevent him from eliminating the previous sorrows and losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, just don’t understand, he will not question, go straight to the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of gravity has an explanation, and other questions that make people suspect that arcane can be solved one day, as long as we explore and study forever, never Give up this direction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Speaker, have you heard this theory of Mr. Evans? I believe that the confusion in your heart should also disappear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien said this, Samantha in the "live room" looked at him with shock and excitement. This problem that has plagued the stars for many years has been solved in such a way, and reversed. It proves that Lucien's interpretation of the essence of gravity is closer to reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was convinced of Lucien’s talent and achievements, she was very admired, but she still maintained strong self-confidence in the field of astrology. And since Lucien has never made any achievements in this field, she always thought that he chose the star system only because of the great use of astrology and prophetic spells. Who knows that he is so amazing about gravity and the stars. Deeply so ridiculous insights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lucy, who was talking about it, she seems to have produced the illusion that the Speaker of the Lord gave the teacher to explain the problem to them. They are all so peaceful. So amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha’s spirit was a little embarrassing, and when Lucien used the gravitational field space-time expansion effect to solve the problem of artificial planet time error, she starred The cognitive world suddenly became eager to move, even if it was just about understanding the content and directly applying the conclusion to calculate the answer, let her cognitive world begin to be semi-substantial—her teacher Nesika is the authority in the field of mathematics, Evans geometry One of the main creators of tensor analysis content is second only to Lucien and Levski in this respect, so she is quite capable in this mathematical field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is definitely an epoch-making, no, transcendental essay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around her, all the arcane masters are almost the same expression, but the mathematical level is not as good as Samantha, and the harvest is not that big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the fear of Douglas’s conversation just disappeared without a trace. As long as you don’t lose confidence, it’s normal to be confused! And Lucien? Evans's achievement at this time gave them a strong confidence to see the bright future of the Arcane's continued research - even if you don't understand it, the conclusion and the final calculation seem to be no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen has no longer read the paper, decided to go back to the four-year "Nature" journal, she whispered to Fernando: "I seem to see another The Speaker of the Speaker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not so stupid when he is." Fernando snorted and wanted to criticize his students for two sentences, but after all Still giving a "very high" rating - in terms of his standards, then continue to bury the reading of the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper is one of the hardest and hardest to understand, and he kept screaming: "If this is what Douglas sees..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Allinge, in Rentatt, in Salivar, in Cuxhaven, in Ksvik, in the Sorals, Pearl Islands An orthopaedic and magic apprentice, with or without understanding and understanding, has become excited and full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cleared his throat and put the backed up papers up: "This is my view of the nature of gravity. It should be said that it is in line with what is currently observed." The phenomenon also gives several prophecies waiting to be confirmed. I believe that with more approximate solutions and exact solutions of the gravitational field equations, we will have more understanding of gravity and the starry sky."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Lucien’s words turned: “But I can only say that this paper is closer to reality than to the truth, and it may not be applicable in the future. In the field, there will be some loopholes in it. Just like mathematical localization, there are limitations and applications. In the current conditions, we can only grasp relative truth, not absolute truth..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Lucien will once again popularize some of the concepts that have been discussed in the Supreme Council and the Arcane Review Committee, and hear the Samantha, Black and other Arcanists. Slightly nodded, a deeper understanding of the development of arcane for centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think everyone in the study of arcane will be confused because of such problems, I feel completely unexplained. I have also had such a situation. The same is true now, such as the principle of 'real world feedback', what is the essence, I often feel guilty, and occasionally lose confidence... This is a normal phenomenon, you don’t have to feel that you can’t find it again. The direction of the research, there are many things waiting for us to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The more you know, the more you feel ignorant' is a sentence full of philosophical surnames But I want to add a sentence later, 'Because of this, we have to work harder, double learning and research, can't let ignorance become our own label', we live in this world, thinking and exploring is our most worthwhile Proud things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien saw Samantha want to speak, and told her to wait and smile. "In fact, just now, I completed an experiment to determine the existence of neutrons."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The live room and the arcane divisions all over the world are unable to close their mouths. After completing such a paper to change the times, Lucien? Evans also discovered the neutron? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight is the night of miracles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the magicians who are good at elements, such as Larry, K, Timothy, Ulysses, Annick, etc., suddenly feel the blood poured into the head The department was almost dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of neutrons means the establishment of the "new alchemy" in the basic framework, which means the coming of the era of elemental development! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravenly controls his body and listens to Lucien about the experimental steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Lucien finished speaking, he rushed into his lab like a blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of neutrons from the conservation of energy and momentum after collision is his usual idea, but what materials are used need to be experimented again and again, and need to interfere from many Anomalous data was found in the complex data, so he estimated that it would take two or three years to complete the experiment, but now everything is different. With Lucian’s experimental description, he directly touched the edge of the neutron. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding materials and making plate-like things, Lavin opened the electromagnetic cyclotron and let the helium nuclei bombard the metal plate again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he captured the trajectory of the proton being shot, he had a feeling that his hands were uncontrollably trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the data was recorded, he only felt that his line of sight became a bit fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When calculating the ray that hits the proton is the neutron stream, his gray eyes seem to have raised two small suns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart suddenly clouded, thunder and thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Someone is semi-cured because of Lucian's thesis and experimental cognition?" Natasha looked at the sky outside the window with surprise and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter’s distant Ketonia listened to Lucian’s remarks and saw the Rantat’s change in the sky: “There is another Master’s cognition.” Is the world semi-cured? Is it due to the interpretation of the nature of gravity, or the discovery of neutrons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the vision of elemental disorder and nuclear phantom, it is neutron Found." Pope Benedict III also looked at Rentatt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia is a bit unacceptable: "I used to know that the progress of arcane research will increase the strength of the magician, but only one paper, one experiment can Has such an amazing effect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The five roads of the difficult road to Sean's paper or experimental value?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter the general theory of relativity or the new alchemy, their value is far more than five legends." Benedict III's voice became cold. "The previous emphasis on Lucien Evans is not enough. I His purification sequence will be upgraded again, and the night watcher’s number one 'night executioner' will be specifically targeted at him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman ranked first' The Night Sentencer is a legendary magician, so the past church declared that God did not count him when he gave power. He only said that he had nineteen Holy Spirit priests and five holy knights (Mermos, Anthony, Beria). , Shi Dong, Baha'u'llah), but organizations such as the Magic Council assess the strength of the church Or will "The night executioner" to join the cast of the church staff as twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia has no way of understanding the impact of the results of the Arcane research, but it is so real: "The Pope, ready to take Lucien ?? Evans ranked first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thirteen, fallen Morning Star, after all the legendary peaks." Benedict III did not respond with emotional ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
