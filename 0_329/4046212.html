			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the month (January), the cold still enveloped Allinge, but the dark green forest outside Douglas Magic School still did not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the black iron gate with a strong ancient magical empire style, Woods eagerly asked the iron monster of the gatekeeper: "I am the ordinary arcian Woods of the monthly magazine is a friend of President Donald, I want to find Mr. Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two Mr. Evans are not there, they are together Go to Rentat. Which one are you looking for?" The Iron Golem answered with a metal-filled, unpopular voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods stunned: "There are two? Well, I am looking for Mr. X. Wait, aren't they all going to Rentat? When are you leaving? What are you going to do? What time is it going to come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an emergency, Woods almost followed the "thinking" of the Iron Golem, and it was awakened in time. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a series of problems that make the red magic light flash in his eyes like if he will explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, they all went to Rentatt, left an hour ago, did what I did, I don't know, I don't know when I came back." The Iron Golem finally sorted out the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour ago? Evans had already arrived in Rentatt, and Woods pressed his black top hat a little annoyed. Rentait is the capital of the Holm Kingdom. No matter the size or the number of people, it is the top ten in the mainland. Without knowing what Lucien is going to do, it is difficult for him to find people quickly - even if he asks the "prophet" to use the legend. Astrology divination can't be accurately located without more information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait for Mr. Evans? Mr. X, please tell him, our "Organic Arcanist Monthly" wants to publish his paper at the end of the month, please He replies as soon as possible. If he is free, it is best to come to our headquarters." In the cold wind and cold wind, Woods spit out a few white air, and then stepped on the carriage again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Rentat, the second floor of the Oak Restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private room, Lucien looked through the window and watched the beautiful night of the goose-like snow, watching the people who came and went in the snow, they Some are in a hurry, some are squatting side by side, some childlikely follow the snow, some bend over and pick up the snowball... I don’t have a small table opposite K. Ignatius, he is a bit a bit The white-level fourth-level Arcanist and the five-ring element mage are tall and thin, and the facial features are especially deep, as if the skin is wrapped in bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If K does not inform in advance, Lucian will probably think that he is a 50-year-old gentleman, but in fact, Ignatius is over one hundred years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent all his savings at the age of seventy, relying on an expensive magical ritual to continue life and sober mind, and it seems to live for many years. . However, his magic level card is in front of the high-end door for sixty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igner's light brown eyes look at Lucien and K, and raise the glass: "Cheers for our happy dinner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the toast, K snorted "Sky Blue" and then got up and went to the bathroom. It seems that the amount of alcohol is very poor and there are signs of vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the back of K disappeared with the closing of the bathroom door, Ignah turned his head and said: "Evans, I probably looked at you before dinner. The paper, I have to say, the advantages and disadvantages are equally obvious, and have excellent discussion value. Unfortunately, our "Elemental" journals will confirm the papers of all the Arcans and magicians who will speak at the annual conference. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien wants to fight a few more words, Ignah shakes the glass: "But K is about to become a disciple of Mr. Larry, and I I have a very good relationship with Mr. Larry. Since he brought you to me, I have to do something as a forerunner in the field of elemental magic. Therefore, I intend to advise the editor-in-chief, Mr. Ravana, that it cannot be postponed due to the annual meeting. The valuable papers delivered by other magicians will make them wait for it. It is best to increase the length of this issue of Element. Of course, there are still many difficulties in the proposal, but it still needs to work hard."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Bright, Ignacio the meaning of words is to prepare their papers included into the "elements" behind the periodical increase in space? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igna looked away from the window and looked at the young people under the alchemy arc streetlights. He sighed softly: "This is the best stage of life. Young is so good. Hey, I am old, I don't want to rely on my own strength. And knowledge has become a high-level magician, and can only turn to the magical rituals of the ancient magical empire that can create miracles. Unfortunately, the materials of these magical rituals are difficult to search, very expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he closed his mouth and tasted the red wine from the vineyard estate near Renttat. The smile was still on the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien first did not understand why Ignatius felt these irrelevant things, but he quickly realized the hidden meaning of his words: there are many difficulties Need to work hard to overcome, can you pay no price? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien said in a tone: "Mr. Igna, sometimes as long as you are lucky, the acquisition of the Arcane Point is not difficult. My last new magic, because of the reference of the Lord Arcane Master, has a very rich income."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igner appreciatively looked at Lucien: "Young people are always full of energy and courage. Old people like me can't do it. The stone of the crown is only three hundred arcane points, but it can't be bought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if Mr. Igna is willing to accept my funding? I don't want to see a former mover stop because of money." Lucien said that he was vomiting. However, if it can be published in the "Elemental" journal, it is many times better than the "Organic Arcanist Monthly". Because of the long-term exposure to various magical ores, there are many magicians who want to discover new elements and elements and alchemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igner raised a glass of wine against Lucien, smiling and elegant: "Have us succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After K came back, I was very happy to see Lucien and Ignati chatting very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Perhaps Ignatius’s efficiency is high, perhaps the “Elements” journal itself has decided to increase the length, but he is tempted by his machine In the air, when Lucien and K left the hotel the next day, the notice of the "Elements" journal was sent to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, K, if you don't have your help, my paper can't be included in the "Elements" journal. This is a low-level Arcanist. It is unimaginable." Before the platform, Lucien solemnly thanked K. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K is embarrassed to scratch his head: "Evans is valuable for your paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In line with his own philosophy, K did not spy on the specific content of Lucian's thesis before the release of the journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s worthwhile for the Arcane Point... Lucien’s abdomen, but as long as the paper is verified by the magicians, it’s worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"K, don't you go back to school?" Lucien was ready to rush back to Allinge and continue his experiments to discover new elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K shook his head and his face was slightly sentimental: "In fact, I have already left, because Mr. Larry’s response to my last paper is very good. And it is not far from the Three Rings, so let me follow him in advance. And just in the past few days I have some things in the hometown of the county of Gran Ling, so I took the opportunity to leave, ready to go back and deal with it. Yesterday at noon I was coming to you. Say goodbye, see your paper rejected, and think about helping you before leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande County is a relatively remote place in the eight counties of the Kingdom of the Kingdom one of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"K, you don't have to be so sentimental, Mr. Larry has been in Aringe for a long time, we can meet often. Yes, I don't need my help for my hometown. "Lu Xien asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K shook his head again: "A little thing, I can handle it easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, K, if you need help, send a letter back to school.” Lucien saw the magic steam train coming and waved to him. “Right, re-measure the atomic weight of the elements...”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K stunnedly listened to Lucien’s last command and decided to have time to do these magic experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............General Oral Division Monthly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
