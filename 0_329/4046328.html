			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible force field wall was completely annihilated by a dissociation process, and the anti-magic ray was directed at the crystal ball of Lucien’s right hand, trying to penetrate. Construct a small anti-magic field inside it and interrupt its connection with the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has been hit by anti-magic rays anyway, his magical ability is limited, so he did not try to use magic to counter, his right hand extended, directly Blocking the anti-magic ray, at the same time, the mouth filled the mantra of the eardrum tingling - this is not your own magic, forced interruption is only a little anti-hit damage, now with the spirit of the five rings to deflate the seven-ring level Magic Tower, temporarily suspending and changing the mantra will make the surging energy counterattack, causing the soul to be seriously traumatized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick silver flashes slammed from the ceiling and instantly turned the room into a thunderous ocean, except for desks and floors inscribed with magical tower patterns. Everything in the old witch's study was destroyed by electro-optical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Ring Magic "Lightning Storm"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch suddenly appeared a layer of light and shadow like a hollow pattern, and all the lightning that hit her body disappeared silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Rings Magic "Energy Immunity - Electricity"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up, the old witch’s left-eyed yellow-brown spheres are printed in different colors, which are fascinating to humans, and people are sleepy. There are direct causes of injury, there are fears and delays, but also people are petrified or dissociated, and the central yellow demon eyes are filled with a strong death atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Rings Magic "Death One Finger"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a violent offensive, the "left eye" of the old witch's transformation faded and temporarily lost the ability to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, no eye-cats will fight in this way, they will reasonably allocate the use of different eyes, to ensure that they can continue to cast spells, but the old witch Already completely disregarding this, it seems to be insane, or for other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can't care about such a terrible attack, right hand on the crystal ball, with the spell in the mouth, let the invisible "magic prison" "Don't fall out of the air, trap yourself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, slowness, charm, sleep, death, etc. hit the "magic prison", can only be dyed with different colors of halo, green The dissociation technique causes it to fall apart and quickly annihilate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crazy offense doesn't mean a perfect offense. If the old witch has a sequence of shots, the "magic jail" is either in the first round of dissociation. It is broken down, or you will be trapped by Lucien himself, making the battle initiative change hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blocking this round of scalp attacks, Lucien suddenly discovered that the old witch quickly and concealed a glance at several beautiful stone carvings on the right hand side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The few stone carvings were not destroyed in the lightning storm?" Lucian was shocked and discovered the fact that they were made of materials. Cheng, or why do old witches protect them more than magic books? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to think about, Lucien went to the subconscious to read the spell, a huge claw that seemed to be formed by crystal ice, suddenly emerged from the floor. Grab the few beautiful stone carvings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Rings Magic "Sajman's Crampons"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower can produce a limited amount of magical effects, including only nine of those already used. Lucien is worried about lasting battles, old witches and various magic The superimposition will make you lose the world without any suspense, so after discovering that there is a problem with the beautiful stone sculpture, he did not hesitate to change the attack object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he was worried that the old witch would take the opportunity to attack his own road, and he continued to mourn the mantra without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch screamed angrily, and the black air appeared on her body, spreading like a wave, just recovering from the glass pattern and slowly climbing to the corner. Adam immediately fell into a state of exhaustion and weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I understand that the strength of the sound of the exhausted wave will be lost, but Lu Xien did not panic, calmly finished the spell, a faint ray from the wall, falling in front of Lucien Above the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-magic ray immediately hit a small anti-magic field after hitting the ground, and the depleted wave swelled here and subsided by itself. The statues of several beautiful women who lived in it broke out with many protective spells, which were offset by the claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I came in the core of this magic tower, I felt a bit Surprisingly, the old witch is a female surname, and she is polluted by the curse. Why is it that the statue of a beautiful woman is not happy for herself?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old witch body And the soul is decaying and aging to this extent, why haven't you died for hundreds of years?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the core of the Magic Tower, the most defensive place, hiding The most important and important things are normal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless thoughts flocked to Lucien's mind, and the crystal ball floated into the air, showing the color of ruby. A red light shone from it and slammed into the remaining beautiful statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-ring magic "Ruby Reverse Ray" can lift the highest level of defense on the target! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive magic of several beauty statues consumed a lot in the lightning storm, and was again offset by the "ice claw cage", so it was reversed by ruby After the ray hit, the light on one of the statues was quickly dimmed, revealing a plaster-colored body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" The old witch screamed angrily, and refused to attack Lu Xien. The force field condensed into a huge palm, holding the beautiful statue, pulling Behind yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands that he has found the weakness of the old witch, chasing after the attack, the spell is ringing again, and a horrible lightning bolt fills the old witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, a beautiful woman statue that lost all its defensive capabilities was smashed into pieces by lightning, and a faint soul followed in the electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch seems to have a lot of aging, the recital is about to break, the right eye is getting more turbid, and the reconstructed left eye is suddenly dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, something like locking life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning Storm" still Continuing, Lucien quickly imposed a "magic jail" on himself. This is a sleepy spell, but if you can perform dissociation, it is an excellent defense choice, to avoid being killed by the last witch's last burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the broken statues of beautiful women, the old witch lost his ability to display magic and stayed in the same place, and became more and more old. In the end, it was directly rotted and pussy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After killing her?" Lucien thought. In the face of the high-level magician, he has been tightening the string, worried that her powerful magic reversal situation will be repeated, but when it is close to victory, it suddenly emerges an unreal feeling, so it kills one. High-level magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is her spell triggering? Is it consumed in the underground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She The choice of sub-magic seems to have problems, or else I can control me before I find that the beauty statue is her weakness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question Lucien’s heart rose, and Adam, who lost his strength, made a happy voice through the secondary mind connection: “Man, you really have a set, actually killed the old witch! This is completely free!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adam, don't be too happy, we have to go to the underground ruins to see if we can find the way out." Lucien sees the old witch slowly falling down, Finally put down the doubts in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the old witch’s face showed a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucian’s head began to blur, and everything around it became dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The darkness receded and the light reappeared. Lucien was subconsciously going to sit up and sit up, but he suddenly found something in his hands and feet. Forbidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, very good, your magic base is very good, the development of these hundred years of magic is beyond imagination." Old witch laughs old The sound rang in the ear of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head and saw that the old witch was still wearing a red magic robe, rubbing his back, wrinkling back and forth, and lying on his own In the familiar magic laboratory, it is just after receiving the "shock treatment". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This?" The inexplicable change gave Lucien a subconscious question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch smiled smugly: "Six-ring magic casting dreams, let me easily know your magic level and the current development of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the escape is just a dream? Lucian's psychological quality is inevitable, but it also explains a lot of doubts, but this also explains a lot of doubts. For example, after unlocking the banned magic collar, I still can't open the soul library, there is no way to summon Rhein, why the old witch has several magic choices. There will be problems, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, given that your so-called 'Arcane' level is good, I will take you into the underground relics. There is a labyrinth inside, very troublesome, I hope you Can surprise me." The old witch seems to be very happy to find a solution to the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly regained his calm and seized the opportunity to bargain: "Ms. Udura, I think that unlocking my forbidden collar can help me. Help you explore and walk through the maze."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I will help you out before entering the maze." As a powerful high-level magic Teacher, the old witch did not worry that Lucien would retaliate against himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch then took Lucien all the way to the bottom of the magic tower, and then followed a winding staircase to an underground passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire passage is five or six meters high and seven or eight people wide, all covered with huge slate, and the left and right walls are carved with murals of ancient humans fighting with underground monsters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This underground ruins is really magnificent." Lucien sighed sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch did not speak, and she used to go to the end of the passage. There are ten gates, each with different mysterious symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the maze." The old witch pointed to the gray doorway in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symbol on this door made Lucien faintly familiar, as if it were a different mathematical symbol, so he asked in confusion: "Ms. Udura, maze What's in there? I am ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No monsters, just a problem..." The old witch was a bit unbearable and then lifted. Lucien’s banned collar and imprisoned bracelet urged him to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the recovery of mental strength, Lucien pushes open the gray door and slowly walks in. Since there is no monster, it should be a simple thinking maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he walks in, the door behind it is silently closed. Lucien, who has dark vision, finds himself standing on a bridge with no end, around It is an endless void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wondered as he strolled Going forward, only two steps are taken, and the surrounding changes suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless voids condense a star, and these sly stars are crossed in front of Lucien, and the light reflects a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please prove that any even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey?" Lucien looked at the change with a stunned look. The follow-up stars became a direct math problem. It seems that all of them are the exercises of Jimmy Dorwich's mathematics analysis. The content inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
