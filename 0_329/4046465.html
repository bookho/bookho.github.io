			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [Www.biquwo.com], this site provides you with free novels for free reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the garden villa, Lucien looks still A thick stack of letters, shook his head slightly, spit out a breath, and then checked with magic one by one, to confirm that there is no problem, then slowly open, roughly browsed again, to prevent people who are too excited like Pi Wei. [This article is from WwW.]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Felipe?" Lucien looked strangely at the letter that he had in the future, and couldn’t figure out that Felipe wrote What do you believe in yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing arcane and magic problems? He and he are good at different fields. They belong to the factions of the two fundamental ideas of the elements and the dead spirit. They are also the highly regarded arcane masters of the younger generation. The most promising ones who become legendary magicians are worthy of their names. The competitors, although they have cooperated in private, once, but even the basic friendship can not be talked about, never had a correspondence, with Felipe's proud character, how could he suddenly write a letter and discuss his own doubts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attack? abuse? Intimidation? The Necromancer's view of the soul is close to the direction of electromagnetic waves and electromagnetic fields. It is undoubtedly a supporter of the wave theory. After seeing the new paper in the journal of Arcane, Felipe wrote a letter to confess his own annoying guy. It seems normal, but Lucien is faintly wrong. Felipe's character is a bit tyrannical, but he is very proud. If he wants to attack and want to smash, he must write the paper directly, instead of doing it in private. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a flaw..." Lucien once again checked the letter, especially the hidden mark of cursing, poison, soul, etc. I also used the astrology to calculate the danger, inspired a lot of magic defense, and then opened the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is normal to attack the light quantum hypothesis... Very normal Felipe tone..." Lucien read and read, his brow slightly wrinkled. A very normal letter, the basis for normal attack is not accurate experimental proof, but also contradicts the classical electromagnetic theory and image, there is no special place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The frequency of misspellings in words is a bit high. There are twenty-seven places in a few pages of letters..." because I feel that this letter may not Normal, so Lucien is reading it carefully. Although those mistakes are not obtrusive, I can guess what the original words are based on the context and most of the letters in it. It will not affect the fluency of normal reading. It is difficult to find out that there is a mistake, but Lu Xien, who often corrects Annick, Heidi and others paperwork exercises and "subversive" papers, is keenly aware of this and resists picking up feathers. The pen, stained with red ink, tried to squint and said, "It shouldn't be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien only saw Felipe officially The papers published do not know whether he usually writes spelling mistakes, but "according to his proud character. When writing letters to annoying competitors, it will definitely be carefully and repeatedly checked. Just like when submitting a paper... Losing face in front of an opponent should be something he is very jealous and disgusting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea flashed, Lucien was shocked, and there was no emotional change on his face. The wrong letters in the words in the mind are clearly and independently reflected in the order of the front and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change these wrong letters back to the correct one. They are connected into a series of words that seem to be composed of several words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death to provoke...wave arguing...inside...submitted to the parliament..." Lucien probably broke the sentence and read that Felipe wanted The meaning of the expression, but after these words, there are four letters that are meaningless and cannot form a word. "What do they mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien couldn’t think of the meaning of these letters, but the meaning of the previous part was enough: the undead in the dead world seemed to want to use the wave-particle argument to create the guilt of the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for their purpose, Lucian’s guess is the Parliament’s investigation into Heidler City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Submit to the Parliament... It seems that Felipe has no confidence in me and himself. Maybe the enemy is the big man of the dead soul, the demigod lich. The only thing that can be relied on is the parliament. This difference in strength can be compensated not by wisdom and strategy..." Lucien Moss licked his chin. "Does he not worry that I also have a collusion with the dead world? Or he knows More?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking to the bookshelf, Lucien looked at the camera without a focal length. He just turned around and suddenly saw a row of language books placed there, with ancient Irvanas, lingua franca, and ancient Mes Kate language, Elvish, Devil, Devil.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing these books starting with letters, Lucien shines: "Maybe the meaning of the last four letters of Felipe is not as rugged as I thought before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This letter is the second in the linguistic alphabet. This letter is twenty-three, this is eleven, this is six...223,116..." From the perspective of the star magician, Lucien’s inner mind reads this set of numbers and recognizes that they are astrological Coordinates, "The location is the city of Heidler... Hey, the entrance to the gap of the Necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading the world of the dead by the hands of the pale, let the parliament begin to explore slowly ...this seems very good, it won’t drag me into danger. I only know this letter, it’s not my turn. Well, you don't have to do anything more, just submit it!” Lucien quickly decided to get up and go to the headquarters of the parliament. At the same time, he planned a big plan to prepare for the instability in the “Pale Hand”. The numerator and the undead in the dead spirits jumped out together, and then they smashed the net, and they smashed and disrupted the "Pale Hand" and completely incorporated it into the parliamentary system to cut off the trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of gray tombstone is inserted on a deserted plain, Lonely, inexplicable horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a huge mausoleum, the skin is pale, and the soul of the dead, who directly wraps the bones, dominates Vicente, floating in the air, trying to bring the golden dragon in front of him. Refined into a sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the dark red flame that jumped in his eyelids flashed abruptly, and the sound of sleeping and slumbering calmed down, and the soul fragments were like the legend of rain. Magic is forcibly interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden dragon roared in the sky, the voice filled with pain and seized the opportunity. You must break free and escape from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miranda's 12th Ring of Life illuminates one by one, and the dragon is shackled and sees it hard to escape. The golden dragon's golden pupil flashed a glimmer of light, and the body swelled up. The slamming sound exploded completely, and the tomb was blown up like a devastating earthquake. Stone pillars, arches, etc. collapsed and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything subsides, only one of the heads of Vicente is angry and coldly: "Damn, it’s hard to catch a golden dragon that is close to the legendary level." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief anger, he quickly calmed down and flew back to the hidden hall of the mausoleum, on a huge coffin with no black pattern, let the dome From now on, there is a starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, when refining the Dragon Lich. He suddenly had a strong sense of danger. This spell failed. I almost suffered a counterattack. Although I ended up doing nothing, I lost a golden dragon and a flesh close to the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the legendary field. Regardless of whether you are good at the magic of the stars, you will deliberately make up for this shortcoming. Even if your own physique and soul completely conflict with the magic of the stars, you will find similar legendary items to wear with you. Otherwise, you will not know what happened to the legendary magician who is good at the same level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of the magician and the priest (the Pope improves God's postoperative), which can be compensated by learning, like warlocks, knights, etc., unless their own talents There are prophetic abilities or similar legendary items. Otherwise, you can only rely on the instinct of the soul or mind after the promotion of the legend to avoid the dangers in a small scope, and cannot sense this unknown, hidden, and wide-ranging danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the soul of the soul of Vicente does not have the soul essence of the magical conflict with the stars, so although not as good as the full-time staff such as the prophet, the magic of the stars is enough. It is much stronger than other legendary magicians who don't have a big Arcane title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the top of the starry sky, the clear trajectory runs, and the remaining head of Vicente floats up and down, and quickly gets the result: "Storm? Storm? Fernando?" Destructive blow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pale head, two dark red flames quietly jumped a few times, and Vicente showed the magical path: "Conger斯...Rogerio, 'Di Mattes', 'Adol'...you come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
