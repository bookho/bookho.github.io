			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers, among the rushing horseshoes, the seven or eight dragons and horses rushed into the Valley of the Valley, and then ran to the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which bastard is so arrogant? It’s completely ignorant that it will hit people!" A squadron of a sword-stricken squadron Face, so some dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Valley of the Exile, except for special circumstances, never closed the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companions used their eyes to indicate that they would not squat again, and then rushed down and said, "Did you not see the leader of the lord of Jacob? Being told by someone in front of him is a bad thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing is one of the members of the Eastern Conference of the Lords of Exile, the first to speak the swordsman closes The mouth, guarding the land, looked around, worried that the complaints that had just been casually remembered by the mindful people, so lightly beaten, and then was stunned and thrown into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for a few seconds, he asked in disbelief: "What happened in Tez Valley? Why did Jacob’s eagerly rush? Hurry?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventing his Jacob’s companion whispered in a fearful and uplifting tone: “I heard that I am the son of Jacob’s adult. Master Warren was killed in his villa, and none of his guardian knights, magicians, and his swordsmen survived!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?! Lun evil... The young master was killed? Who is so bold? Is he not afraid of the revenge of the Jacobs?!" Warren was notorious in the exile in the east, the swordsman only felt great, almost screamed, but he just lost his words. I paid more attention to this aspect, so I noticed it in time and forcibly endured it. Then the huge surprise rose from his heart. The East Exile did not know how many years had happened. Someone dared to challenge the authority of a lord and still kill his only son! This is a hatred that cannot be resolved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion is well-informed and likes to show off the strengths of this aspect. Seeing that several other goalkeepers are curious and quietly encircling them, they are slightly excited. : "The slaves in the Warren Masters House are missing! It seems that when Warren was kidnapped, he was offended by someone who should not be offended. Therefore, the strong man came to the door and killed one without leaving the ground. Without such hatred, who would make such a hot hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first talking swordsman turned back and looked at the street where Jacob and his party disappeared. Tail, gently sighed: "Jacob is only the son of Master Warren, he will certainly not give up hate easily. During this time, everyone should be careful not to become the object of Jacob's anger."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, it is said that it was a matter of the afternoon, because the magic circle separated the sound, so it was not discovered until the evening. With so much time, the strong one is sure Escaped far away, it is difficult for Jacobs to catch the murderer. He is a werewolf. Veins, under such a heavy blow, I am afraid it is difficult to maintain your sanity, hey, East exile in vain there are a lot of people will be dead! "Informed gatekeepers swordsman shook his head slightly afraid. Fortunately, they belong to the guards of Tez Valley. As long as they do not find their own death, Jacob will not vent their anger on their heads. It is not to put the nine city owners in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob is a four-level knight, the wolf's blood, in the same level, speed, strength, agility, claw attack, self-defense, resilience are very Outstanding, but also has the ability to violent, evil shadows, roaring shocks, dark and weak aura, is a very good blood, the disadvantage is that there is no long-range supernatural attack ability, and in the moonlight can not maintain reason, will become a real giant wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The garden villa living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob looked at the flesh and blood on the ground, his eyes wide open, and a bloodshot appeared on the eyeball, dyeing a blood red. My son, the son who raised nearly 30 years, has become such a broken piece of blood? You can see the internal organs, fingers, etc. everywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his fists tightly, and a long, gray hair was found in the gap between the black armor gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensitive nose was pumping, and Jacob used a tone that was suppressed as the storm was about to come: "The blood tastes more than Warren's, and Others' damn bastard, he actually let their flesh and blood mix together and can't be separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Binsai, trouble you to check here with magic to see if you can find clues." Jacob's face has a grayish white hair that appears to be a bit unable to suppress his emotions, but in order to get the information of the enemy, he forcibly endures Living in the heart of the desire to kill, that is the desire to tear all the humanoids seen into pieces. "When I know who you are, no matter what the cost, I will let you kneel in front of Warren's coffin. Always be there! Even if your body has become a bone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-level magician himself can become the lord of the East, or as the nine The consultant of the city owner, so Jacob, the four-level knight, was not qualified or qualified to hire a mid-level magician. Only the second-circle magician of Binsei took his students as his magic adviser - due to magic Surprisingly unpredictable, if there is no magic consultant in the dangerous East Exile, even the big knight will suffer a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binse took a crystal ball from his pocket and set it in the end of the black magic wand, then began to perform astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball becomes dark, as if the starry sky at night, each star draws a unique trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Astrology does not prompt, it seems to be a magician who is good at the astrology, and his magic to kill Master Warren is fireball, the initial judgment is three Ring.” Bingse failed to get feedback from astrology, but judged by experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob’s eyes are reddishly pointing at the half of the bar that was blown up and the blood of the beach: "This kind of powerful explosion magic is just three rings." ?!" He began to feel violent, and he obviously didn't trust Bince's judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle of fine wine on the rear of the bar was exploded and the wine was flowing out, so that only half of the chair was soaked and the floor was soaked. This rich wine blends with a bloody smell that makes Jacob's nose a bit out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binsey pointed to a little bit different from other glass fragments on the ground: "Jacob, you see this, there are still many alchemical explosives detonated at the time. It seems that after Master Warren or Real was controlled, his body was full of explosives, and then another person was fired by fireball, so the power was much greater than ordinary fireball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, no, I want to hear how Warren died. I just want to know who the toast that should be torn into pieces!" Jacob was a word and a word. Spit, then growl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binsey took a breath and once again ignited the crystal ball on the black magic wand. This time the crystal ball became dark and the stars did not shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old, evil voice came from the crystal ball: "Under the unknown of fate, the long river of flashing time, summon my magician, you You can exchange five gems for the answer to a question, only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic of the three-ring star system "Astrology", which can be unknown The evil exists to ask questions, it only answers yes or no. If the problem does not exceed the level of the questioner itself, the correct rate is around 75%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binsey's magic wand appears to be a three-level magic item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five beautiful flame rubies just touched the crystal ball and immediately disappeared. Then, Bin Si asked: "I want to know that the magician who killed Warren is Didn't you have a hatred with him in these few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time frame is shortened, making it easy to investigate...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old evil voice replied without hesitation: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the answer, Jacob could not wait to command: "You You, and you, you have to go out and inquire about the news, inquire about the news from all channels, and see which Warren has a conflict with the magician these days! We must hurry and the magician has not escaped too far. Grab him and let him know what it means to regret!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers have left the garden villa, and Bince has put away the crystal ball, leaving With the help of the two knights, they checked the traces of the explosion, the traces of the direction of the fireball, and unfortunately nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jacob adults, let’s go check out the places where other dead people are and the secret rooms of the slaves. These places may have been left by the magician. Clues. But the villa is large, we are understaffed and need to transfer my students and your other attendants." Bince made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
