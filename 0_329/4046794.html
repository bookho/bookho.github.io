			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder Hell", the magic tower of Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there is no other thing to disturb in Aringe, Lucien maintains the habit of conducting an arcane and magic exchange with the teacher every week. But when he entered the teacher's study today, he accidentally saw the old-school gentleman Brooke wearing a white hair set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does they not always "like" face-to-face communication with teachers, preferring to use letters? Lucien thought to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook did not wait for Lucien to say hello, helped his own gold silk eyes, smiled and said: "In recent days, your paper on the roots of magic is in Afghanistan. Line caused quite a stir, and I got a lot of inspiration from it. Congratulations, the first formal model about the nature of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to Fernando One sentence: "The 'observer effect' is not a good thing, it will make the world unreal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled, right The perseverance of the world makes it difficult for teachers to have a good impression of the "observer effect". In particular, this explanation does not have any strong evidence, nor is it a rigorous deduction. It is just a whimsical horror of a big arcian." prophecy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, to be honest, I have just begun to explore this aspect of the content. There are still many places worth discussing in this paper, 'negative energy vacuum sea 'It's the same.' Lucine said very sincerely. He believed that the teacher and Mr. Brooke could see it. Then he deliberately shifted the topic. "Teacher, Mr. Brooke, what are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to face the roar of the teacher, of course, it is best not to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was inspired by your thoughts on the quantization of electromagnetic fields when studying spontaneous radiation problems, plus Annick and Sprint their electronic problems. Similar processing has shown remarkable value. So I want to start from the idea of ​​'secondary quantization', completely introduce quantum theory into the classical electromagnetic field theory, and construct a quantum field theory to deeply explore electrons and photons. Other book friends are watching: Study the nature of electromagnetic force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to the nature of electromagnetic force, Brooke’s slightly thin half-face is like a bright It has a radiance, which is that he unconsciously interfered with the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While discussing microscopic research, he carefully used photons instead of electromagnetic waves, and apparently has a great deal of the wave-particle duality of light. The acceptance of the degree is not only completely absent from the theory that caused his cognitive world to break and solidify, but has a strong research**. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernan seems to be a little messy forever. Fernando is not angry: "Then he took me to study together and solve the problem, no matter what I was studying the fission reactor." The reason for the loss of control and the preliminary theory of weak interaction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weakly interacting force" is the nuclear power of Fernando's reference to Lucien and Hathaway - "Strong interaction force" is named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is unwilling to look like. The bright red eyes are bright and bright. This made Lucien laugh. Teacher If you don't want to, you can't and no one dares to force you to study quantum field theory related issues, but it seems that you are completely happy. It is full of enthusiasm and motivation for establishing such a system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien understands very well that from the "secondary quantization", the establishment of quantum field theory will certainly go through a long and tortuous process, because In terms of computation, there are inevitable major problems - the infinite amount of divergence, which needs to be slowly explored to solve new mathematical methods, and this is only one of the more significant difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this period of research, we have initially established a quantum field theory in the general sense. But it has too many defects, so that we Ready to publish in advance, let more people explore." Brooke's delightful and contemplative answer is entirely in Lussien's expectation, "just meet you, just some questions to discuss together."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sent an invitation unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s expression, which has never concealed his feelings, slightly slammed down and whispered: “Damn infinity!”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking their draft, Lucien quickly browsed it again, sinking: "Not a relativistic quantum field theory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a plan for the future, Now solve the general problem first. If you are interested, we can discuss it often.” Brooke did not hide, and the discussion in the mouth was obviously a discussion with authorship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the teacher did not invite the Speaker of the Speaker to join this discussion, perhaps worried about Mr. Brooke’s relationship with him? Lucien judged this, but Mr. Brooke is right, the research should be step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas is busy preparing for his own ultra-long-range space jump, and he has a lot of research, no time to distract more fields, otherwise he is happy to do something similar The work, as it is now, for him, discovering that the planet may be more important than life..." Fernando was as loud as he thought in his heart, and he was not avoiding Brooke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the draft, Lucien himself had research, so he quickly joined the exchange between Fernando and Brooke and put forward some of them. A bright idea. Fernando and Brooke are not surprised by this. It is said that Lucien, who first proposed the quantization of electromagnetic fields, did not study this aspect. They were the first to disbelieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this discussion atmosphere, time passed quickly, and Brooke stood up satisfactorily and picked up his cane: "Although the main problem is still like truth." The gods stood in front of us, but finally progressed. Fernando put this paper up at the end of the month to let more arcanes see it, hoping that they can come up with new and useful ideas."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exchange, he understood that Lucien also had no solution to the most important problems. Of course, he was already one or two. He was unable to solve the preparations in the year and seven or eight years. In this case, he has experienced a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The estimates within the parliament that are understandable and interested in studying quantum field theory will not exceed one hundred arcane masters..." Fernando has always used his mouth to be sinister and good. Known for the thorns, "They may have preferred the magical roots of the negative energy vacuum sea and the microscopic particles, which satisfy all their fantasies, good-looking novels."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Negative energy vacuum sea, this is a bit beyond reality, because it is difficult to imagine that we are living in a negative energy vacuum sea, but it does not sense its existence, but it is not Maybe, huh, the vacuum may not really be empty." He feels this way, "Lu Xien, what do you think about the negative energy vacuum sea? It solves the energy and material problems of your magical idea." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have reservations about this." Lucian answered cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook is obviously very interested: "Do you have other ideas? Wouldn't it be the 'real world' that you can't study for a while?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am starting from the principle of uncertainty, Mr. Brooke, do you remember the huge energy fluctuations described in my paper in a very short time?" Lucien is not like a student. I have reservations, but I am honest about my own direction of exploration. This is not a teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vacuum fluctuations?" Sure enough, Fernando directly asked. Brooke paused for a moment and recalled: "Because time and energy are a pair of quantities that are consistent with the principle of uncertainty, the more certain the time, the less energy is." It is determined that in a very short time range, because of the uncertainty principle, even a vacuum, a huge amount of energy suddenly emerges and then suddenly disappears. On average, it conforms to the law of conservation of energy and is difficult to be sensed... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more unrealistic than the vacuum of the negative energy state. The space around it has always had a constant wave of energy, but it has no induction. Not affected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can be described as a undulating energy sea." Lucien puts its description close to the negative energy vacuum sea, which is easy to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has no exclusion of the principle of uncertainty. He opposes Lucien’s description of its material intrinsic properties and believes that there are other reasons leading to the uncertainty principle. Therefore, he did not growl in the "continuously undulating energy sea", but seriously said: "This can also explain the source of energy, and it has something to do with the field theory we studied. I think that if we continue to study, we can propose a A new model of particles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
