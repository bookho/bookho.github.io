			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room on the second floor of the villa, the baron of Austin, dressed in a pajamas, was holding red wine and listening to the sweet and touching voice of Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the country was mourning, he was embarrassed to find his mistress, and he could only spend time on the sound of mystery, and he could hear a lot of fun from this channel. The show is sometimes more fun than a mistress. In the Kingdom of Holm, in addition to the most conservative part of the nobility and believers, listening to this banned magic radio station is a very fashionable thing, especially the gathering between the enlightened aristocrats, but also the topic of this, who if not Listen to who will fall behind, and be rejected by the circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...From today's beginning, our program will be revised to a certain extent, and then the audience will listen to the Holm observation hosted by me. "The fastest time to know the great things happening in the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think the audience already knows, our dear, respected Prince Patrick His Royal Highness was sorrowful after the death of His Majesty King Fertis, and he followed, but what happened to the details and details of this matter? This program will lead everyone to explore the truth behind the matter."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Austin was originally resting leisurely on the back of the sofa. After hearing the introduction at the beginning of the show, he slowly sat up straight and his face became more and more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Watch’s exploration of this matter is still in the stage of no evidence to rely on representation and position to guess, from time to time to interview some do not know where to pop up The witnesses who came to prove that Prince Patrick had been in a relatively good state for a few days, although the "Night" did not say it, but the words were all suggesting that the church did not like the prince's pro-magic and pro-alloying industry attitude, making it easy. Through logical derivation, the truth of the church assassination of the prince is obtained. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a sigh of relief, Austin recalls the situation of the Noble House’s enlightened members of the House of Representatives, the more he thinks more suspicious, a week ago, His Royal Highness just presided over an enlightened Sending a party, the physical state is still the same, no obvious deterioration, his relationship with His Majesty the King is very poor, which may be too sad to die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even the Crown Prince dared to assassinate..." Austin placed the red wine glass in his hand on the table and stood up and paced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was facing the window, suddenly two figures flew in and quickly fixed him with only the official knight level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? Dare to attack the nobles... the night watchman!" Austin saw the black gloves worn by the two men. "You dare to arrest the nobility directly." You are the agreement that undermines the church and the nobility!" Juliana came in from the French window and looked coldly at Austin: "The church is too weak. Only we can maintain the glory of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to divide the aristocracy and the church, will weaken the strength of the church, and let the glory of the Lord not spread?" Austin was not a fool. He instantly realized that he had met the legendary extreme spirit of the night watchman. Therefore, he did not have a strong expression to appeal to the aristocratic court and appealed to the Supreme Inquisition Court of the Holy City of Reims. Strength, unable to defend the glory of the Lord more effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the Lord is endless, He has not stopped you, but is testing us, if even your aristocrat who falls to the magician is cleared, it will cause Huo. The rally of the aristocrats, it means that they have all fallen, there is no need to save, the king must lie at the feet of the Lord." Juliana has a heartfelt hatred of the magician, reaching out coldly, Press Austin's forehead, "Go to hell and confess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare..." The light shone, Austin's head was directly pierced, and all the blood evaporated. There is no dirty carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana’s left hand with black gloves is on the right hand: “Why will he be dealt with, what crimes he committed, and submitted to the referee , handed over to the House of Nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are righteously representing the will of the Lord, this is our duty, and we will never hide."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The other vigils answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he really said what you said, it was influenced by the secrets of the dead spirits. Like the pope and saints of the northern church at that time, perhaps his goal is to divide the five parishes from the church and become the pope... ..." Natasha has not yet sorted out her position, and she does not know whether this speculation is good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Don't blindly refer to the past, Thrad is deep, not necessarily doing this. After all, the Southern Church can no longer afford it again. The split, and he took office for more than two months, even the Cardinal of the Holm parish may not be confused, what to split, not to mention the parish guarded by other Holy Spirit priests, so don't be him. The performance in a short period of time is confusing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha whispered: "In short, I will carefully test his purpose, you have to be careful, you are cleaning the sequence One of the best among the top ranks of the strongest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rest assured, I have the ring of Congas." Lucifer En looked at the iron ring worn on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the left hand will invalidate the supernatural power, Lucien will move the Holm crown ring to the right hand, leaving only the unaffected legend in the left hand. Ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are great things about legendary items!" Natasha deliberately "indignant" and authentic, "When I sort out my heart, I strengthen the spirit of the knight and improve At the eighth level, I also have it! By then, I will take the shield of truth, that is, the strongest defense and the strongest attack in one, let you envy, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't want Lucien to end the call with a more depressed mood, so she finally made a joke with optimism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is just bright, the House of Lords, the Duke of Rex, is gloomy The ground flew to the Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald Saint-Salt, I need an explanation, why the night watchman cleared a baron directly without the approval of Her Majesty and the House of Lords. "An official knight!" said Rex, who sat in the study room, and his voice grew uncontrollably. "This will make all the nobles feel cold, how can they trust the church?" Will the church contribute? On this issue, there is no difference between conservatives and enlightened people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saldepin and authentic: "I just knew this thing, I Will let the person in charge of the referee handle these night watchmen, and will give an explanation to the nobles. Rex, you also know that there are many extremes in the night watchman, I just took over the Holm parish less than three months, it is still difficult to be effective Suppress them, can't you destroy the relationship between the nobility and the church because there are a few mad dogs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Sarde’s attitude is very good, Rex’s anger is alleviating Some: "If it is just the private action of individual vigils, and We can get severe punishments, then I am sure to appease the conservative aristocrats, but the enlightened aristocrats and the magical parliament behind them are hard to say, and the Queen’s Majesty has just been crowned and the nobles have encountered such a thing. It will make her contradict the church and the conservatives. I hope that you can control the church and not to end this extreme situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I can only say that I try my best to bring the Holm parish into control within two years. No longer similar situations occur. During this time, I hope that the nobles can pay attention to their words and deeds and protect their own safety. If they are found in the church. The extremes are eyeing, please let me know." Thrad replied very eloquently. "Right, you have compiled the reaction of the nobles about this matter into information. I will report to the Pope, no matter what, the extremes. They are devout clergymen or night watchmen. To deal with them, they must get the consent of His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex nodded: "Okay, I will tell people to I will go to Nexel Palace first, and explain it before the Queen, so that she will not be angry and leave a bad impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarder picked up the documents on the table, which was the list of the night watchers who acted alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile looked again, Sard’s index finger gently stroked, Juliana’s name disappeared, and then he mentioned the feather pen and wrote: “...for a long time In the situation of being suppressed by the magical parliament and the devour of the sacred light, the attitudes of the priests and the night watchers in the entire Holm parish have been divided into many extreme situations. One person suspects that the imperial priests have the need to improve theology and the gods. The inner leaders should be eliminated so that they can unite against the magician's parliament, and some people are similar to them. They think that the church is weak, the aristocrats are arrogant, and they must be radical to awaken the other clerics who are numb."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
