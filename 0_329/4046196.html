			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint glanced at Katrina, shook his head indifferently, and went to the assessment room without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from Sterk, even on the dangerous sailboats, the two have not stopped competing, often ask questions from each other, When casting magic, it is better than trying the speed of casting and magic control. Unfortunately, the winner is often Sprint, which makes Katrina very unconvinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing Sprint’s disdainful attitude, Katrina slammed her feet and snorted, and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The state of mind relaxes, the assessment is very simple." Lucien chin lifted his head and pointed to the assessment room, indicating that the three apprentices had rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick they focused on the key: "Yes, Mr. Evans." Then he left with a little nervousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard hands in the double-breasted black long dress pocket, see Annick their respectful attitude, could not help but smile: "Lu Xien, this is How do you know the three apprentices? How about the basics of the arcane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you have been studying for more than a month, how can you be better? I just let Through a lot of repeated exercises, they will firmly grasp the most basic parts as soon as possible, so that their future arcane and magical learning will be able to embark on the real road." Lucien replied casually, for Annick they passed the assessment. A little bit worried, their degree has at least opened up another apprenticeship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter Lazar wants to look at Lucien: "A lot of repeated exercises? Are you afraid of killing their arcane talent?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the real genius that people can only look up to, ordinary children with arcane and magical talents can only go through hard work, hard work, perseverance and persistence. Farther. If they don't have that genius, they must make up for it in other ways. Otherwise, why can they catch up with others?" Lucien smiled but looked a bit serious. "The tempering of the way of thinking must run through the hard work, not alone. Cultivate, or else there is no foundation house, and it will fall when you poke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar is just a chat, no debate: "Oh, Lucien Very talented as a teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, my nickname is 'Professor'." This sentence can only be said in the heart, The subject shifted the subject. "Lazard, do you have a lot of double-breasted black long dresses? How do I feel that you don't seem to have Changed clothes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard laughed: "This is my magic robe! You don't think that only the ancient magic empire The gloomy robes with hoods are magic robes? Now there are black long dresses, evening dresses, tuxedo-type, and cake-skirts. I want to have any style of magic robes. There are also magical robes that can change styles at will, but they are more expensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the second-level magic robe? I just miss one." Sean heard the words and asked with a little excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar refers to his black double-breasted long dress: "Night of praise, two-level medium-sized magic robe, worth two hundred Jintale Or arcane point, Wasim alchemy shop production, 100 years of credibility, good quality and low price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You deserve to have..." Lucien is silent To make up one sentence, I figured out my own property. "I only have sixty Jintales and nine arcane points. Right, Lazar, the exchange point between Arca Point and Quintal is One to one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Djibouti Principal to Stourke's journey, Lucien was not ill-treated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar nodded: "Yes, but the higher the level, the wider the use of the Arcane Point, at least in Aringe, than the Quinta Le is more applicable, according to the greedy bankers, this is the parliament with its own credit as a guarantee. In fact, I also spent a long time to get enough money for the magic robe, but after becoming a formal magician, not in Aringe Difficult to find things to do, ten gold Thaler or Arcane points are not a problem in a month, plus the benefits of improved magic being learned, you can buy a medium-level magic item in two years or so."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need me to borrow your money? I haven't used the thirty arcane points that the burning hand got. Oh, I believe that Lucien is capable of returning. The apprentice-level magic will definitely be studied by a large number of arcane masters who want to study and want to improve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar was very frank and did not hide his envy: "Lu Xien, you guys who have been passed down to ancient magic, are lucky, there should be a lot of materials or magic items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two rely on the wall, one is arbitrarily chatting and chatting casually. The time is over, the door of the assessment room suddenly opens, and Heidi immediately rushed out and said happily: "Mr. Evans, the topic is simple. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her is Lei Yi Li Ya, the black pony tail leaps with her run: "Yes, than Ivan Mr. Si, the last practice you gave us was much worse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, simple. Annick, what do you think?" Lucien smiles Jaws head, asked Annick, who was out of the assessment room for the third time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick smiled awkwardly and scratched his fluffy hair: "Fortunately, okay. Thanks to Mr. Evans for your guidance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it easy for you not to do it?" An apprentice who came out behind them couldn’t help but say indignantly, "Sprint, you said yes No?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint’s proud look faded a lot: “Most of it’s fairly simple, but a little less is more difficult, and I have nothing. Grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Splint, do you think so?" Katrina, who had a slightly poor face, smiled slightly after hearing Sprint’s words. It turned out that the topic was too difficult, not that I did not learn well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s really hard, I think it’s hurting." Other magic apprentices agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina saw the door of the assessment room re-close, hesitated and asked: "Sprint, 'attacking the undead' this apprenticeship magic How did you parse and construct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am..." Sprint has no confidence in this, so he is no longer proud, say fast Come out and prove with Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other magic apprentices also quickly inquired about the answers of others, trying to judge how much they were right, and the scene became very noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked at them in a puzzled way: "But it's really simple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyia is also a puzzled expression, but when the apprentices are talking about the answers, they can’t help but scrape together:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question should be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, it is calculated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you? How did you answer it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ormos, Annick and Heidi also joined in, only Lucien and Lazar Look at the corridors and smile at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the answer is finished, it is close to 10:30, and the apprentices are waiting nervously for the results of the assessment. No one speaks and the atmosphere is very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the door of the assessment room, which seems to tear his heart, slowly opened, and the apprentices looked nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mermaid who came out took a document and said seriously: "After the assessment, I announced the results of the assessment."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices seem to hold their breath, even Annick, Reyia, and Heidi, who thought it was simple to check, were a little nervous because they were infected by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first grade is excellent in the basics of arcane, spiritual and magical release have reached the level of formal apprenticeship, they are Annick, Lei Yi Li Ya and the sea Titus, the magical tendency is the star system and the element system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? How are they?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Annick? Reyia? Heidi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not Sprint and Katrina?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
