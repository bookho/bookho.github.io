			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the thunder, Lu Xien looked up at the window, and saw the glimmer of light, the rain drove, and the time went unnoticed to the early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off the magic array and the alchemy device, Lucien picks up the white glazed porcelain cup, walks to the window, pushes open the window without the magic array protection, blows the face It is a fresh and humid air, spring is full of people, it makes people feel energetic, full of vigor and vitality, and it is a beautiful day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the "new alchemy" theory system on the table that can be said to be a collection of more than a dozen papers, I thought of introducing the quantum concept into the internal structure of the atom. Lucien took a deep breath of fresh and delicious air. Half of it was a sigh and half whispered in a self-deprecating sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big headshot era is coming "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This upcoming field will be more grotesque, more ridiculous, and more deviating from the intuitive experience of the past. The question of "cat" is nothing more than a brainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the electromagnetic kingdom, a piece of magnet collapses and the current is abrupt Disappeared, a period of arcing into a full-powered snake, smashing on the ground with the destruction of all the huge lightning, squatting on the magic tower, piercing the transparent defensive layer of the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it going to be destroyed? Teacher..." Barrek looked out of the window, swaying, and saw a black crack around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the current around the current converges, and in a twinkling of a moment it becomes a thick electric snake, which spirals up around the magic tower, opens its mouth, absorbs With the huge lightning that slammed down, the body swelled to the limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electric snake blasts open, like a fireworks that blooms in the sky, the invisible and unqualified electromagnetic waves, whether visible to the naked eye or not directly visible, are stuffed The entire half-plane space is highlighted, as if it is a wave of ebb and flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves are disconnected from them, and they are broken into a myriad of small pieces, but their overall shape still forms a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of strange scene has just emerged. Before Barrek reacted, it could not resist the real existence of the smoke, and it stopped, everything returned to its original state, and the electromagnetic kingdom was stable. It is full of broken atmosphere, the ability to flow electric light, the magnetic field that still exists is less than 10%, and in some places there is a black hole that makes people feel heartless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with it is a long sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." Barrek blurted out again. He knew very well that the semi-position of the legendary magician was the external projection of his own cognitive world, half. The face has become like this, the teacher's cognitive world can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still meticulously wearing a wig and gold-rimmed glasses, Brooke walked down the stairs, his face was abnormally dark red, and shook his head: "There is still no way to incorporate the quantum hypothesis into the volatility system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The experimental result is..." Barrek asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook slightly stunned: "Although I have been psychologically prepared, it is still a bit unacceptable to see that all the experimental results are in perfect harmony with the optical quantum hypothesis, so I The cognitive world has been shaken. Later I tried to understand this hypothesis, merge it with the volatility, and reconstruct the cognitive world, but I can't find a breakthrough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At an old age, Barek still panicked and worried: "That teacher knows your world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Broken and solidified." Brooke Pinch your forehead and reveal the vicissitudes of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, but unbelievable, Barreque is still unacceptable to Brock himself: "Is this not to say that the teacher has been stagnant since then?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Brooke is calm and calm, not forgetting to shake his head with self-deprecating. "Thanks to the limitations of experimental conditions and going out to find mysterious space, if three years When I first saw Evans's quantum hypothesis, I had the ability to conduct experiments on the spot. I am afraid that the cognitive world collapsed directly. The 'electromagnetic kingdom' was completely destroyed. If it was in Aringe, it would probably ruin half. Line City, fortunately, with the buffer understanding of these years and the feedback from various experimental results, I am not going to be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is no exaggeration that Brooke ruined half of Allinge. This is still based on the fact that Allinge has one of the best lock defenses in the world. It is replaced by Rentat, and Alto is absolutely the whole. The electromagnetic storm that broke out in the city together with the nearby small towns and manors was completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn Evans!" Although it is sensible to know that this has nothing to do with Lucien, but emotionally Barek is unacceptable, gnashing his teeth and said with anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook waved his hand and his face changed from dark red to pale: "If he insists on absurd theory, I will fight him to the end, but the results of the experiment I have initially confirmed his light quantum hypothesis, which shows that I am wrong instead of him. I am too persistent on the wrong path. Should we hate that the world does not exist in the form we want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he knew the world was broken and solidified, Brooke was calm and calm, still kept a gentlemanly manner, and even started a joke, completely without the expression of roaring and mocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Fernando belong to two completely different types of people, the same place is the fear of the unknown, the love of the Arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Barrekâ€™s face was still anxious and worried, and he hated the expression of hatred. The teacher who had been good for the past few hours was seriously injured. Has it been stagnant since then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook walked to the window of the living room with his hands on his back and snorted: "This is both despair and hope for me. It is both a blow and an opportunity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Barrek didn't understand too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook stretched out his right hand and opened his five fingers: "Don't mention whether the god of truth exists, starting from a historical record, able to step from the peak of the legendary field In addition to Himself, there are only four, the Lord of Hell, the Abyss will, the mysterious existence of the Necropolis, and the Pope. The first three are said to be the same as Altena. Level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, did the Pope not reach this level?" Barrek asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook coughed a few times: "For me, the pope promoted by the power of the "God of Truth" is just a symbol, the symbol of the spokesperson of the god of truth. No matter how many things have been experienced, the strong is not the name behind the pope, but the word of the pope itself can only be counted as one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So." Barreke nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook looked at the broken electromagnetic kingdom outside, and his voice was smooth and elegant: "So, it is difficult to be promoted from the legendary peak of the 'genuine' field. The extreme thing, from ancient times to the present, only the Pope has done it, even if the genius such as the Sun King Tanos, my teacher, also stopped at this stage, it is difficult to find an effective way. This time to find the mysterious existence of the dead spirit and silver moon The action of Aitna's shards may bring hope, but it is more likely to remain confused. At this level, it is not an urgent and terrible thing to stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Barek sighed quietly. Yes, even if the cognitive world is broken, the teacher is still the legendary peak. It is the strongest standing at the top of the world, except for the three infrequent 'genuine'. And even if it is not damaged, it seems that it cannot be promoted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And this time the cognitive world is broken and solid, although it is desperate, but it is not an opportunity." Brooke voice became low, "Through this experiment I saw a huge loophole in the volatility, so that I can thoroughly understand the electromagnetic wave and figure out why it can express the special surname of both the wave and the particle. Perhaps it is the opportunity for me to recognize the world reconstruction and break through the legendary peak. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the great impact, but still showing a strong and enterprising spirit, there is no trace of a frustrated teacher, Barreque is just like when he became a Brooke student. I looked at him with reverence. Just now the teacher said that genius is like Yang Wang Tanos and Douglas Speaker. In his heart, in the minds of most of the magicians in the Magic Council, he is not inferior to the genius of the former two. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a huge electromagnetic kingdom, the structure of the ancient magic system, won the title of Archaeologist less than 50 years old, the age of 80 becomes the legendary peak, there are Who can exceed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, should the results of the experiment be announced?" Barrek thought of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
