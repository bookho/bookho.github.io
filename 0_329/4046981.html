			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun sets, the afterglow is like fire, the real Aalto is more like a cemetery, except for a few magicians who are guarding the walls of different areas very far apart. Only a few pedestrians wandered the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the empty road, a "horse" car flew past, without arousing a little hoof and wheel collision, just like a special envoy from Silent Hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "horse" car is like this because it has no wheels, and the four horses running in front are all stunned, as if the pale fog is condensed. Only the head burns a blazing flame, and the eye position is a red light jumping at two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the ‘nightmare’ in the rumor?” In the half-opened window of the window, the rare female voiced, slightly magnetic, extra temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec's magic robe became the collar until the back of the dress, sleek and fashionable, and this makes him exceptionally unsuitable, constantly pulling different parts of the clothes, It seems a little breathless: "Yes, this is a special horse created by the teacher who can directly enter the dream. It is a step-by-step fusion of the undead creature of the ghost horse and the demon 'dream controller" with special ability." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many types of demons, even the most learned legendary magicians can not boast that they are fully recognized, and the magic empire can not have the trend of knowledge sharing, not enough The important thing is that others will not share their own unique knowledge. Even some spells and knowledge as a card will not be shared at all. Therefore, even if some kinds of demons have been discovered, they are only a few. People know, such as the "dream controller" mentioned by Antec, Fernando had never heard of before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Dream’ pulls the car. Is the party in a dream?” Fernando, the bright-looking “girl”, stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec smirked: "No, I specifically borrowed it. Since I have a female companion, I have to be a little more solemn."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are not completely incurable." Fernando expressed a compliment with his unique habits. On the exquisite and beautiful face, the bright red eyes are extraordinarily brilliant, just like the night. The lightning that lit up was unusually appealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec is a good chest first. But soon I picked it up again and sighed sadly: "When you are laughed at, it will be even more painful." Look, the female partner who was so easy to find the fool, borrowed the female partner who was sent by the nightmare. Easily snatched away, the loser is the loser'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of his second half of the sentence is vivid, but also deliberately pinched the dice, apparently imitating a certain I often laugh at his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s better than before being robbed." Fernando didn’t know that he was comforting. Still sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec thought for a moment: "It makes sense... Every time there is progress, it’s a good thing. Anyway, I don’t expect to find a female companion, etc. I became a Master. There are many girls in the dream. There are many girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't treat illusion as real." Fernando converges. Seriously reminding friends that after so many years, he found that Antec is increasingly showing signs of being addicted to dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't illusion be real? Why can't dreams become a real world?" Antec had suppressed it for a long time, and his tone was a bit excited. "This is the illusion system." "All the magicians share the hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the highest achievement of the illusion is that you even deceive yourself?" Fernando's mouth is more poisonous than Antec. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec shook his head: "No. It’s not deception, it’s really real..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not finished, "nightmare" has stopped, in front of a villa with a serious style and gloomy color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes, illusion things don't rush to discuss." Antec once again pulled the neckline. I walked down the carriage and turned around. According to the etiquette taught by Fernando, he reached out and took "her" down. In this respect, Fernando was much more experienced than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antek’s face suddenly floated with a suspicious blush, and the left hand unnaturally moved, feeling the unspeakable part of Fernando’s neck full and full of elasticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this, this is true, really?" he stuttered, his body tightened, as if he was wrapped around by a giant snake. Living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando proudly said: "Don’t doubt my magic level, even if it’s a legendary magician, I’m afraid I can’t do it so well before I get that item. Constant conversion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I still feel weird..." Antec rigidly took Fernando to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you can't even enjoy the 'weird', take the opportunity." Fernando said with a smile, bright as the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec found that Fernando’s swearing and wretchedness had reached a level that he needed to look up, so he had to close his mouth and step on the steps with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the power of the gods that Pope Gregory showed in Lance was true, or that he relied on the magical style of Lance. Lost?" Fernando suddenly spoke up on other topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, what?" Antec did not start with Fernando on a "frequency" before he came back: "I don't know, anyway, listen." My teacher said that at the time it was indeed beyond the strength of the legendary peak, there was no doubt, but until the end of the battle, he did not leave Lance half a step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fernando nodded and thought again to the extent that Antec couldn't keep up: "Stannis will attend the party tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a The gathering of small circles, most of the leaders are legendary students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, what?" Antec once again expressed his guilt in the same language, and then said: "He has not been in Aalto for a few days, go out to collect "Materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many magicians gathered in cities like Aalto, the materials will not emerge for no reason, so the magicians will take turns leaving the city Go to places such as forests and dark mountains to collect resources, or go further and go to places rich in gemstones in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives the vigil and clergy a chance, assassinations, sieges and other events. The magicians will not swallow their voices, but also set traps, which in turn kill the church personnel. Therefore, cities such as Aalto and Tria are calm and peaceful in the absence of legendary battles, and the surrounding areas are caught in repeated strangles. , <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a trap that tries to lure the legendary shots, but neither side can make a big victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. When Stanis is out, maybe it is really collecting some of the materials for promotion, perhaps to set a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, Fernando came all the way, learned a lot, nodded: "When he comes back, he will discuss illusion and dreams with him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you are just waiting for a few days in Alto, to find a magician who has the potential and is willing to go to the Holm area." Antec said with delight. This is one of the true friends in his life. The total number does not exceed three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled and said: "So my nickname will become 'the shame of Antec?'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you still go back as early as possible... Anyway, you know about the situation." Antec looked at his right hand in a sad way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I have to understand the details of the specific battle and collect the information of the cardinal and epic knight. It is convenient for future dealings. So in a short time, you have to The reputation of shame." Fernando said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the iron gate of the villa was open without wind, and a slightly thin male voice sounded: "Hey, Antek, where did you find the female companion?" Is it a money in the 'Pink Mill'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magicians, Dark Knights, Dwarves, and ordinary people all have physiological needs. Therefore, the prostitute industry has not lost the space for survival. The "Pink Mill" is one of the best. Of course, they mainly provide services in their dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
