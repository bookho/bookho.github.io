			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Miss Rachel." Lucien smiled and summoned, though she already guessed who was the brunette blue-eyed lady next to Rachel. But still politely asked, "I don't know what this beautiful lady is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien first saw Rachel is in the committee At the discussion meeting about pollution, she still maintained the style of vitality at that time. The linen eyes contained a kind smile: "This is my teacher, Ms. Isabella, who did not expect to meet Evans on this floor. Mr. You.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Ms. Isabella. As a man, Lucien is the first to say hello, "Congratulations on winning the Wizard's crown, and congratulations on your level of Arcane increased to level 7." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi's eye corners noticed that the arcade badge of Isabella's chest has turned into seven silver stars, Rachel's arcane The level has also been upgraded to five levels.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella in a black dress smiled slightly: "Actually, I am preparing to visit Evans this time." Without your brainwave papers, Rachel’s chances of winning the laurels will be greatly reduced. It complements our preconditions, but I didn’t expect to meet you here in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is sincere gratitude or pure courtesy, at least Isabella’s words make Lucien sound very comfortable: "My paper is just a supplement." It is important to be able to get the laurels or the results of the two women. Oh, I applied to the Magic Research Council for an arcane research project. Let's take a look at the lab environment today. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Research project? I don't know what it is? I also applied for an arcane research project, which is an illusion study that studies electromagnetic waves and currents to stimulate different parts of the brain. Today is also a look at the experimental environment. I intend to invite you to cooperate with us on this project. You have unique insights in the brainwave field, but now it seems that you can't do it. "Isabella's smile is very standard, perfectly conforming to the ceremonial posture, and asked with a little curiosity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence is her polite statement, she has Sufficient ability and knowledge to complete the project, but she and Lucien have no hatred in the past, and have not complained recently. Lucien himself is an arcane master with unlimited potential, standing behind the storm, and maintaining a polite attitude. The best choice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been approved, Lucien has nothing to hide, gentle smile: "I applied to the Magic Research Council for an 'Atomic Research Institute 'The project mainly studies the atomic nature of the atom itself and why it shows the law of the cycle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel blinked his eyes, this strange project, how is this large and empty research direction approved?<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong curiosity made her almost blurt out, but it was a very rude behavior for the students to be interrupted by the teacher, and they could only hold back.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Research Institute? "Isabella's mouth is slightly open, and one word repeats one word. Although each one knows it, when they are combined, they seem to be a little confused.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien was psychologically prepared for their reaction, explaining casually: "This is an attempt by the parliament to study new fields, because no one knows what happens when they step into this new field of arcane. What phenomena are discovered, no one can formulate plans and plans in detail before starting the research, and need to try and explore again and again, and the establishment of the institute is to break through this dilemma and give a broad time to a certain extent. Subsidy support only requires direction, does not require specific planning, and gives researchers the greatest 'failure' freedom. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage, Lucien said that it is a grandiose, very popular with the official spokesperson of the Magic Research Council.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wide time? A certain degree of subsidy? Isabella always felt that there was something wrong with this research project, and looked at Lucien with a confused look.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhehe smiled: "It must be three years." There are results that will satisfy the Committee to continue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three years? ! Rachel finally couldn’t control it and blurted out. The teacher’s application for the Arcane research project was only one year, and the subsidies given by the parliament were determined by the progress and status of the study. What kind of research in Lucien seems to be only the atomic field. The results will be fine, no strict requirements!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly said how to ensure that the Arcanists do not simply write a new field to apply - anyway, do not need a complete plan and argument, how to ensure that this kind of research organization does not spread fraudulent behavior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the form of the institute is only for arcans who have made outstanding contributions in this field, and to review his ability to conduct research in this area, but also The authoritative Arcane division in the field gives an assessment opinion.” Lucien did not hesitate to talk about it. “If it really fails in succession, it is also a tuition fee for exploring and researching in this field. After all, we are crossing the river by feeling the stones. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the elegant gentleman in front of this "righteous words" standing behind the storm dominates, Isabella and Rachel are not in his language I was puzzled and couldn’t help but groan in my heart: "It’s a good way to swindle funds! His talent in this area can be compared with his talent for arcane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Thinking about his poor arcane research project, Isabella smiled more and more etiquette and shifted the subject without a trace: "This is indeed a useful attempt. When it comes to trying, I am in Drummond. I saw Evans’s paper, and I solved the problem of several Arcanists. To be honest, when I first saw the two papers, I couldn’t think of how to formulate two different angles. I didn’t even think about ignoring any actual arcane meaning, just use mathematical methods to piece together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, the chances of being chanted by the magicians will be many times more than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The tragedy is that I am still worried about the meaning behind the formula." Lucien said a good faith lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isabella’s attention is not on this, plus the two are unfamiliar, and they swear a few words and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is Ms. Isabella?" Katrina implied and looked forward to Isabella's back, she was in the magician During the period when the management department was doing things, the most famous female surnamed high-level magician was Isabella, and she also won the crown “without expectations”, “elegant, knowing surname, beautiful, dignified, intelligent, powerful, I really hope to be a woman like her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Those work hard, if you don't work hard, there will be no hope." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............July 30, early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Happy, Natasha." Lucien put down the feather pen and sent it to Natasha’s envelope, which was still trivial. Discussed with the music, but attached a piano piece adapted from the ode to the oyster gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Lucien put the letter in his pocket and went to the restaurant for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit, Katrina, Annick, Heidi and other magic apprentices and Lazar have been waiting in the restaurant, except for the cut in the magic school Li, they all quit their jobs and began to prepare the "Atom Research Institute" officially launched a few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, Lucien! This issue of "Arcane" was released in advance!" Lucien just sat down, a messy hair The young man rushed in, holding the dark black cover of the "Arcane", and in this issue of "Arcane", the five Arcanists wrote a thesis around your formula, analyzing the existence behind it. The law, plus your thesis is to solve the imperfect formulas of the other two Arcanists. The papers of the seven Arcanists are centered on your thesis! Hey, this is something that has never happened before! The first issue focused on Ms. Isabella’s thesis is also exaggerated!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is a friend of Lucian and Lazar, Douglas Magic School Teacher Rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the application of the Atomic Research Institute, Lucien issued an invitation to friends to ask them to be their assistants, because there are no plans to hire many people. Therefore, the invitation letter is first and foremost, and the person who vetoed before will be sent to the person behind. Given the richness of the conditions, the superior conditions, and the existence of three years, Rock and Jerome promised to come without hesitation, which is the most important three years for them to hit the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two friends working with themselves, Lazar was delighted first, then he made a joke and said that he was very sorry, why Lu Xien did not hire beautiful women. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the middle-level arcian, Lucien has not found satisfaction, and to this level of elemental Master, as long as there is a corresponding arcane research ability, Learn from the teacher or serve as an assistant. Better yet, you will do important arcane or magical research, and explore outside. There are very few people doing nothing, such as K, Larry, Timothy, and Ulysses. The place refused the invitation of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
