			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing magic to live in Sophia and others, Lucien examined it in detail, and then took the notes and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These notes are incomplete and sloppy, faintly able to see the style changes of the writing person as they age:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...After exploring the ancient ruins of the deepest part of Hell, the teacher and Sorano have all sorts of weird, but they are never optimistic about me. What is the value of the astrologer apprentices who cannot even build a fateful star? If my father died because of saving the teacher, he would not care for me. Hey, how do they know the true meaning of my destiny?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...They are not people, but a devil! Maybe when they came back from ancient ruins, they were possessed by the devil... I have to be careful, not to care. Can't let them discover that I know their secrets..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I can be sure that the devils who have never been recorded are It seems to like to play with people, and cause distortion of the family name, negative accumulation of emotions... I can't go on like this anymore. I'm looking for an excuse to go out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good insurance, if it’s not the special star of my destiny, they have caught me ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I finally know what they are devils, arrogance, jealousy, greed, hatred, pain, indulgence, hypocrisy, and all other devils It’s different...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”...Sorano wants to kill me, he doesn’t know if I’ve been promoted to the Seventh Ring? It’s just coming to give me an experiment. Material, I have to see what the 'greed' devil is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...there is no way to imprison the devil's projection, how to study? Maybe I should go out and go to the deepest part of Hell to explore, I hope I can find some useful information..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I can’t find a clue, try it. Can't be integrated with the ordinary devil blood..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the results of the experiment are so good, greed After the fusion of projections, the soul can be empowered, and the soul and body can be greatly enhanced, and the cognitive world can be consolidated. Perhaps this can speed up my promotion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "... Since the negative emotions that cannot be vented have reached a critical point and can be mysteriously linked to the seven devils, then why am I not artificially created, I have to design a special palace and ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What is this? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I was wrong from the beginning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I I think I have found the secret of greedy for the seven devils, I think I have found the truth of the world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many disabilities in the middle, and there are few important records. These notes don't seem to be intentionally omitted here. It seems that some people are vying for them, causing some of the paper to fall off. As a result, it is not important for the winners to see them. The time is urgent, so they leave in a hurry and are then ancestors of the gorse family. Collected and reorganized in order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed, hateful, painful, what are their secrets? It actually involved the truth of the world. "In the mind of Lucien, the notes are automatically formed in the soul library, but this huge mystery is not explained by the incompleteness of the notes, which evokes the curiosity of Lucien and does not satisfy it, making the road Sean was very depressed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconciled the emotions, carefully searched the secret room, and found no other valuable records, so Lucien forced the soul library to force The magic array and the altar composition in the hall are recorded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the treasure next to the "magic scepter", according to the Sun King Tano The records of Sri Lanka, they can be combined to extract the projections of mysterious devils, and to ban them and fuse them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because greed and other seven devils are too mysterious and too strange, Lucy En is completely uninterested in the ritual of converging the devil's projection to consolidate the soul. If greed, arrogance, etc. are lurking into their own "mind", they will not be able to pay for it, but extracting them and imprisoning them is a good deal to deal with them. Way, say Study this mysterious unknown creatures every arcanist all have enthusiasm, not to mention they also relates to the real world <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Yes." Sophia replied with respect and respect, and hated it in her heart, experimenting with "assistant"? Oh, surely it’s a dangerous thing to do yourself, or to help him explore the unknown area. It’s awful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hate to hate, life is under the control of Lucien, she can only endure the emotions, cleverly follow Lucien to leave the secret room, go In front of the oil portrait of the first Duke of the gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is still a secret room? How many secrets does this palace have?" Sophie looked shocked at Lucien opening the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she raised a deep fear in her heart. "Do you know this secret, will it be destroyed by him?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can't stand still, you should never move." Lucien smiled and looked at Sophia, his expression was pure and harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Sophia, this gentle and faint face is simply the demon of the abyss, more vicious than the greedy, painful devil, can not wait for a fireball to him The face is flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this can only be a beautiful fantasy in her heart. In reality, she sighs and sighs: "I will go in immediately, Mr. Magician."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will die if I don’t go in, there is still a glimmer of hope after I go in! Maybe there is no secret inside, don't you have to be killed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long, secret passage, Sophia saw the inner layer of the palace, as well as the statue of Tanos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly look around and find that there is nothing special, Sophia feels relieved and her legs are almost soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked to the statue with Sophia and pointed to the right hand that Tanos extended: "You touched it there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, isn't there anything? Isn't that simple?" Sophia stunnedly raised her toes, reaching out to the right hand of the statue, halfway through, she subconsciously Looking to the side of Lucien, the result was found to be empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue." The deep voice came from far away, and Sophia looked back and found that the mysterious and powerful magician flashed in just two seconds. In the secret road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia stutters: "You, why are you hiding so far?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe dangerous Lu Xien told her honestly and sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brush, Sophia’s forehead immediately has cold sweat dripping, which can be dangerous, dangerous, dangerous... If she still has a sense of reason to control herself, I’m afraid it’s already a shrew The smashing up, let the curse entangle the bastard magician generation after generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up, we have to set aside time to sign a magic contract." Lucien reminded with a flat smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia heard the warning in her words, the forehead was dense and cold, and the right hand seemed to be filled with lead, and it reached the predetermined position with an unusually heavy weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A move." Lucien, who was wearing the "曰之冕", saw Sophia touch the edge of the light white ball, indicating that she was moving up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia’s slender and swaying hands trembled violently, sometimes slowly and sometimes swaying, fearing of terrible changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Lucien looked at this calm picture with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, heard this sentence, Sophia only felt that all courage and perseverance disappeared, stumbled and sat down, soft and powerless, but okay nothing. Fortunately, nothing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien uses pre-existing inductive magic to judge from Sophia's emotions, muscles, etc. that she did not touch the ball of light, and no other effective response - - This is why it is not necessary to control the magic of humans to control Sophia, so the response is not real, not "first-hand data", so Lucien frowned for a while, confirming that there were no other minor changes before they went to Sophia. Let her leave a breath on the shackles of the shackles, just like using the sacred emblem of the truth for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
