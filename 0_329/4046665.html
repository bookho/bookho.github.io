			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler City, dark and gloomy, with a hint of gray, as monotonously solidified in the world of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the entrance gap, Douglas, Fernando, Vicente, Claus, and Elika have arrived, waiting for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you bring the shield of truth?" Klaus saw Lucien, who was late, smiling and guessing, "plus You borrowed the crown of thorns, and there are a total of five legendary items on the body. It is unprecedented. Even the magician of my full-time alchemy can't match, and the speaker is only four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord's item is either the legendary peak or the legendary third-order, how can I compare it." Lucien "modest" authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the number of legendary items is scarce is that the main materials needed are precious, perhaps not collected in a few hundred years, and the requirements for refiners Very high, in addition to the legendary magician and the Holy Spirit pastor, the vampire prince, Taikoolong, etc. can only rely on racial talent to refine with strange methods, the failure rate is extremely high, the epic knight must rely on others to help, so, in There were very few similar items handed down before the Magic Empire. The late period of the Empire was an outbreak, and the number of legendary items has doubled or tripled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Hathaway’s legendary magician who is good at “luxury cracking” and “decomposition of elements” makes people hate and not afraid. If you accidentally let the accumulation of years be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead dominated the conversation between Vicente: "Since it has arrived, we should set off."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s time to go." Douglas took a faint smile and was not nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a lot of intelligence from the Necromancer, the Magic Council has long cracked the problem of how to see the gap. At this time, under the special arrangement of the magic array, The twisted gap is clearly visible, with a strong sense of death, filled with the boring black and white ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gap, once again experienced the feeling of passing through the thick shadow curtain, Lucien stepped into the dead spirit world, surrounded by Heidler The city scene, many towering magic towers are piled up in a row, like a black and white picture of a child's casual doodles, filled with a touch of gray everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world, except each other, has no extra color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beginning to enter the world of the dead for the first time, getting the shackles, knowing that Mr. Muskilllin was trapped, it’s almost ten years, and finally it’s finally starting. Exploring the journey of the dead spirit world." Lucien was deeply impressed when he was just a formal magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the transmission in the Necromancer was suppressed, Douglas and Fernando led Lucien and others through the continuous jump of seven forward bases and arrived near At the forefront of the deepest base, I saw the prophet Begner here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still wears a gray pointed hat, and the two white eyebrows seem to be a little longer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The result I got with astrology is that there is no mystery in the mysterious existence of the dead spirit, but there are other dangers hidden in the Temple of the Dead. You must not care. If you are in great danger, remember, don't Anxious to go backwards, only to advance to see hope." Bergner said that he spent two months preparing to predict the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando wondered: "Forward? And we just arrived at the soul fireplace, and returned after a preliminary exploration. The legendary undead creatures in the peripheral area should not be able to cause us a substantial surname. Danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ador’s memory and the information left by Viken, there are only four undead creatures in this area that reach the legendary third-order: Lich King. The servant of death, the ancient mummies, the lord of the ghost, the one who is Douglas alone can suppress at least three, the rest of the undead are not the legendary second and first order, the number is also more than six, if there is no legendary third-order interference, Fernando himself Let them really fall into a deep sleep, not to mention the dead souls who are quite restrained by the dead spirits and the "local tyrants" Lucian, even if they are completely surrounded by more than forty unseen creatures without intelligence, the problem is not Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adol is only a high-order undead, and the understanding of the outer periphery of the Temple of the Dead is still very superficial, only familiar with the places where he often goes in and out. And all the rooms, palaces, and corridors in the Temple of the Dead are changing at any time, like a living maze, perhaps a dangerous room or a martyrdom that it does not know." Vicente cautiously refuted Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophet Begner dungly said: "I don't know where this danger comes from, maybe you can't touch it, but always be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently Nod, on the road to Sean, Erica and other humanities: "This exploration is divided into two parts, the first part is to try not to cause big movements, just like Maskilin they first quietly arrived at the soul fireplace Preliminary research on it, and by the way to find signs and reasons for cooperation between the church and the dead community, the second part is to return to the peripheral areas, and gradually clean up those legendary undead creatures without intelligence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan has been discussed before, he is the final confirmation, the reason is not to clear and then enter, is worried that the movement is too big for those who have the magic of the legendary undead fear, will be the Temple of the Necromancer The possible unlocking of the lock, or the interference of other forces, can not achieve the purpose of exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the plan, the six legendary magicians left the forward base and flew to the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Lucien’s pupil suddenly reflected a huge black, that is a magnificent palace group, even bigger than Allinge. How many times, there are half the size of the Holm kingdom, and the height is even more incalculable. Because of the deep gray sky, I can't see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the legendary war would cause the destruction of a normal city, it would be a collapse of a palace or garden for this palace group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The deeper the walk, the stronger the material of the palace, perhaps the deepest room is made up of the wall of sighs." Rarely, there is a longing for exploring the soul fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wall of Sighs", one of the strongest defensive magic of the Necromancer, except that it will be destroyed by real sunlight and cannot be broken by any attack, and he just uses this Make an analogy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for this magic, Lucien is not worried, "eternal blaze" happens to be its nemesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilderness outside the Temple of the Dead, densely packed with dead bodies, human beings, elves, dragons, eyes, and Tao Fish people, there are sphinxes, they are covered with skin rot, muscles and white tendons are exposed, a strange locust is constantly drilling and drilling, they are slowly creeping, wandering aimlessly, because there is no sound and color It’s like playing a black and white movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all very good corpses." As the height is lowered, the soul of the dead, Vicente, looks at them with delight, just as the child sees his beloved toy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika whispered the mantra and displayed the illusion of the group, so that in the feeling of each undead, Lucien et al. People are dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Temple of the Necromancer, the six men landed completely on the ground, shuttled through the undead, and rotten and stenched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, the wandering undead also began to appear as high-ranking leaders, some with intelligence, and some with instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a three-headed giant dog looked at the white flame and seemed to smell the breath of life, the breath of disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It opens its mouth and is about to make a silent roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Vicente glanced at it, and the dark red flame beat, so it slammed on the ground, three skulls touched the ground, white bones The stringed tails are raised high and are extremely fearful and flattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the vicinity of it, other undead creatures have stopped acting and are doing a strange gesture, seemingly welcoming the return of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the ‘the soul of the dead’.” Lucien understood the exact meaning of this legendary profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the invisible deterrence and illusion, Douglas, Fernando, Lucien and others didn’t take long to see the shimmering black icy wall, look Not at the end of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entrance is six kilometers to the left." Douglas calculated from the memory of Ador, which seems to have a strong immunity to the spells of the exploration class. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
