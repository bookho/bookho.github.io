If I don't know you, I definitely think that this is done by a middle-level arcane master who has been through at least 10 years of arcane education, especially the mathematical reasoning of the inference. The logic is very Rigorous. Do you really only learn the basics of arcane and magic for three months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lucien is able to pass the arcane There was no doubt in the assessment, and the mouth was smiling and nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric licked his cheek in his right hand: "In the assessment room of the Wizards Management Department, unless you have the help of legendary level magic items, you can't Cheating, and there is also my supervision with Ms. Lucy. So I announced that Evans’s results of your Olympics basic assessment are authentic. After submitting to the Minister’s signature, you will receive a basic Arcane score. Wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Magician Management, one of the three deputy and four ministers take turns on duty, of which the minister is a member of the Panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Eric’s assessment results submitted to the minister through the tower’s transmission array, Lucien looked slightly forward: “Mr. Eric, my article The results of the review of the thesis do not know when it will come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Lucien is better at keeping calm than many of his peers, and even most magicians Also a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the Periodic Table of the Elements in the history of geochemistry is undoubted, and it also plays an important role in the course of scientific development, symbolizing the end of human exploration of the elements of nature. , summed up the law of the elements and used the rules to guide their subsequent research. And what is hidden under the appearance of the cycle surname is another unimaginable field. The in-depth study of this field has completely smashed the cognition of geophysical past and may also subvert most of the current theories of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the periodic table of elements is no more than the cornerstone and throne of the elemental field, but even such an important research result is proposed in Mendeleev. Later, many people scoffed at it, and even his teachers thought it was meaningless and wasteful. Even in the early 20th century when its important surname was universally recognized, it failed to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry because of the difference of one vote. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien is inevitably a bit nervous, such a paper without a theoretical derivation and a purely summarizing surname requires the verification of the latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I boldly predicted and guessed some of the atomic quantities and new elements that need to be corrected, but here is the world, where is the new element hidden or unknown, I don’t know When can I be discovered, some of the atomic quantity corrections involve the separation of strange isotopes, which cannot be verified for a while, and maybe the Arcans will curse and stop when they experiment here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this takes time, and Lucien doesn’t want to have a high-level magician’s sadness at a “Holm Crown Awards” awards ceremony. The local language: "Let us mourn Lu Xien? Mr. Evans, his periodic table of elements shocked the entire magic world, but was unfortunately killed until the results of the research were recognized after death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and want to get a good response as soon as possible, you need to publish this paper in a journal with sufficient influence, and be seen by more arcanes, as long as one of them verified The atomic quantity error is published and its own periodic table paper will be seriously valued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric heard Lucian’s question and answered seriously: “The short review of the paper is three days. Sometimes, the members and gentlemen are busy. It may also be a week or a month. Evans, the last time you can get a timely review is because the new magic was submitted at the same time, it is not normal for a gentleman to be moved by its idea to find out the paper. It is not normal. Rest assured, each paper is in The Arcane Review Board is internally archived and is reviewed separately by the two gentlemen. No one will steal your results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days, okay? "Lu Xien did not say much, and he has not revealed the danger of flaws in a short time. In Aringe, the defenses of important buildings such as experimental towers are relatively strong. In order to not disturb others' sneak, at least the strength of the Master is required. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have too many secrets, Lucien is ready to think of a plan, directly borrowing the power of the Magic Council to remove the undead and pull out the people behind it, he is sure I don't think I have a magical item close to the legendary level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you got the basic arcane points, and in the latest issue of the journal, there are eight arcane papers citing your bat experiment papers and new magic principles, plus the reference of the storm master, you get Nine quoted Arcane points. You currently have a total of 17 Arcane points. Congratulations on your promotion to a Level 1 Arcanist. Eric took the Arcane Badge and looked at it, then extended his right hand with Lucien. Congratulations to express congratulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcane Badge has become a silver star on the black background, deep and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Eric handed out the magic badge and handed it to Lucien: "Because of the storm's dominance, a lot of arcane masters are new to your apprenticeship. Very interested, and the exchange price of an arcane point is also relatively cheap, so you get a total of 769 arcane points, which is really an enviable start." As for the magic level advanced information of the second ring, Lucien is ready to update after the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Eric’s mouth, Lucien took a deep breath and was shocked by this number, which means Allinge’s The magicians have nearly one-tenth of their bat screaming magic, which is an amazing proportion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of the Arcanist is really unparalleled, and he has brought himself a rich income while hanging himself on the wall, even if he is at ease. Magic teacher, do not eat or drink, do nothing, it will take at least six or seven years to get enough of these arcane points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a serious financial fan, Lucien is hard to suppress, but when he thinks about the undead, he has to calm down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new Arcane Badge and Magic Badge, Lucien returned to the Hall of the Wizards Management. <br /><br />###################################################################################################### Enviously congratulated Lucien, because he was the magician who got the official Arcane level as soon as he joined the Magic Council. The future looks very bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please use Cindy and Donna for lunch, and Lucien returns to Douglas Magic School for the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The 14th floor of the Magic Tower, in an exclusive lounge of the Commission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio’s pale hand holds a glass of red wine and listens quietly to the report of the tall, burly and undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This undead is wearing a black hooded robes, but unlike the ancient wizard's robes, it has many weird and mysterious white patterns. Its eyes sparkle with a little red light, the skin is pale and delicate, and the figure is hidden when it appears, as if it is constantly shuttled in two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adol, you mean, Lucien Evans is a normal, hard-working wizard who is not in contact with anyone who is doubtful. And the content of his magic experiment, you also know from his dialogue with other teachers, is to verify the characteristics of different elements by verifying the elemental surname?" Rogerio is more polite to this undead, not like Treating general summons is more like a partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead Ador was lightly clicked by the head covered by the hood: "Yes, no doubt. At the same time, I did not find anyone monitoring." Protecting Wayne? Evans. Mr. Rogerio, you should understand that I can shuttle between the two worlds, unless it is a legendary magician or a nine-level cardinal, it is difficult to be breathed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody monitors and protects? I also intend to use this to trace back to the professor." Rogerio left his hand and stroked the back of his right hand holding the glass. "Maybe Lucien Evans is the elemental will to throw to attract and divert our attention, otherwise how can he use his name in a bright and honest way. Things are really complicated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It is necessary to promote the development of things. Otherwise, if Lucien is not in contact with the magicians of the elemental will, it will be difficult to observe." Rogerio walked to the window and looked down at the ant. The size of the road to Sean left the magic tower, "He has come here more than this time. Arcane points, what have you done? Pass the assessment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, Lucien is afraid that he has been studying arcade for a year and a half, and there is enough Ability to pass the assessment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Larry’s study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
