			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wide, sparkling river squatting in a slightly deserted plain and one of the mountains or a gorgeous or cargo-filled ship heading towards Calcutt Going, whenever there is a place where the waves can't be reversed, there will be a lot of coolies gathering, shouting the number, dragging the ropes and pulling them one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wind where normal people feel cold, these trackers are all naked, and there is a vaginal scent around the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are not a domestic mercenary, maybe I have become one of them and become a tracker on the Niegning River." Katrina was quietly listening to the familiar horn, and a slightly hoarse male voice suddenly sounded in her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big river is the "aorta" of the Shahran Empire, which gave birth to the mother river "Negning River" in many prosperous cities. It originated in the northwest. The snow-capped mountains controlled by the Vladimir family flow through the northern provinces, marching southeast all the way, and finally injecting into the storm strait at the junction of the Shahran Empire and the North Coastal Corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina turned his head and looked at the young man next to him, smiling: "Everyone has the opportunity to change their own destiny, just to see if they can grasp Obviously, Yakov, you are the one who has defeated your own strength. If you don’t have the determination to die, you will always follow the wave, then you will be as hard as the trackers on the Niegning River. Five years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov is a light yellow short-haired mercenary, less than thirty, but with a face full of beards, full of vicissitudes Taste, tall and rugged, called "brown bear" by the mercenary team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you choose to be a mercenary is also holding such a determination?" Yakov looked and smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Shahran Empire is sparsely populated, magical creatures and robbers are numerous, going out is a very dangerous thing, especially in the north, so one A beautiful girl is very attractive, unless she has the strength of the Cavaliers, the same reason, without companionship, joining the caravan will attract a lot of extra attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in order not to be suspected by the clergy and noble knights of the Northern Church, Katrina cautiously chose to impersonate mercenaries and forged the proof of the mercenary guild. Mixed with a escort caravan to the ranks of Calcutt City, and Yakov is the leader of this mercenary team, a knight who has inspired the blood of the Frost Giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina was influenced by the teacher’s habits, and the corner of his mouth twitched slightly. Just to answer, a clear female voice rushed in front of her and said, “I am coming. Guess, Katrina, are you trying to escape from marriage? A girl like you, must be born in a well-educated aristocratic family. Then I will be seen by a powerful aristocratic scum, forcing you to be his wife. So, in order to escape, you have to choose to become a mercenary to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna, you listen to the story of the bard listen too much... ··· Katrina glanced slyly at the female archer wearing a leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is a mercenary who is less than twenty years old, with long blonde hair, green eyes and good looks, cheerful and lively, much like the sea Ti, so Katrina and her see each other, the friendship is good, and she shows that the tall, tall and talkative Katrina is full of curiosity - she was grown up by the story of the bard, she intuitively thinks Katrina Behind it, there must be a bumpy encounter with "tortures and movements." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, her thoughts are also speculations of most members of the mercenary team, although Katrina’s sword is used well and her skills are very flexible. With the strength of high-ranking knight attendants, and a few female mercenaries are also beautiful than her appearance. But she is temperamental, and occasionally thinking about the problem is even more unspeakable "knowledge breath", which is inside the mercenary It is basically not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov has secretly worked with a formal magician known as "learning", but he does not have a similar temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna laughed twice and looked at the city of Calcutt, which was getting closer and closer, and asked with a little expectation: "Sister Katrina, we will follow ya Kefu boss settled here. What about you? Will you leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov has inspired blood in the previous adventure, this time back For the title of the title. After the seal, he will receive a nearby manor and a territory on the desolate plains, and his mercenary team will be willing to become his knight attendant or housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Anna’s question, Yakov and several nearby mercenaries quietly erected their ears and seemed to be waiting for Katrina’s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina smiled and reached for Diana’s golden long hair: "I came to Calcutta for wealth, maybe a few months later I I will be able to get a satisfactory harvest. At that time, I will return to my place where I have my family and friends. Being able to meet you in this adventure is a memorable memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grounds under the cover of the forests and desolate plains near Calcutt City contain a lot of resources and magical creatures, so there will be countless traffic to and from this branch. The mercenary is active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many adventurers who come here and hope to find things such as gemstones, magical plant gatherings, etc. that have not yet been discovered, so that they can get rich overnight. Most of them ended up being quietly disappointed to leave or lie in the depths of the forest and the plains forever, but there are also a few lucky winners who have truly won the adventures. They have inspired generations of adventurers to come. Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of special products nearby have a great effect on the research and the alchemy of the magician, so the official magician will come to take risks and get involved. The admiration of the demon incident, inexplicably died in the city of Calcutt, if he came with his companions, the rest returned to Allinge, the parliament did not notice the disappearance of such a magician, let alone The person investigated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family············································································· Before you leave the city of Calcut, be sure to come to see me often.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov’s voice is low: “Katrina, if there is any need for help Don't be shy, even if you come to me, we are companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina slightly decapitated, seeing the scene seem to be dull and quickly shifted the topic to Anna Waiting for someone to inquire about the city of Calcutt - she was ten years old when she left, only a rough and vague impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the discussion, the mercenary team protected the caravan from approaching the city gate. At this time, a group of cavalry rushed out of the city, and the horseshoe rushed but was very neat. Obviously, it has undergone long-term training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry was wearing black full-body armor, and the mask of the helmet was also put down, giving a cold and cold feeling, as if from the battlefield of the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are blood-colored giant bears in their left-handed arms, and a head in the left palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Blood Bears of the Count of Vladimir..." Yakov’s voice was very low and introduced to Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina is no stranger to this, although the Vladimir family’s territory is in the northwestern province, but they also have certain restrictions on the neighboring northern provinces. Influence, such as the city of Calcutta is the hereditary Earl of the Vladimir family, the lord is known as the "Count of Calcutt", the blood bear coat of arms symbolizing strength and glory is the exclusive coat of arms of their heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is envious and fascinated by the side: "The Blood Bear Legion, it seems to be welcoming the Viscount Andrea!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Viscount Andrea?" The name is too ordinary and too popular, and Katrina is not sure what he has done, although it sounds like the next Earl of Cartart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Viscount Andrei, at the age of twenty, became the official knight who was promoted to the Grand Knight at the age of twenty-five, and reached the Grand Knight two months ago. The pinnacle, by the epic knight 'Ninelle, fancy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become his student! He will definitely be promoted to the Cavaliers in the future and become the strongest one. Earl of Calcutt." Anna said in a dreamy tone, like discussing the actor in the prince or bard story in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigne "Death Storm" Ninère? Katrina was a little surprised. The first-order epic knight is the current owner of the Fettado family. The actual ruler of the northern province is precisely because of his promotion. St. Ivan is considering the Fettado family. The title was promoted by the Marquis to the Duke. Isn’t the Fettato family not worthy of the Vladimir family? Are you dissatisfied with the fact that they are involved in the northern province? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
