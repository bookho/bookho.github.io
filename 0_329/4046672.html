			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up and down is short, left and right long...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Prophet...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red eyes with a lot of ridicule...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar Northern Church Saints Dress Up...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the details are as clear as the slow motion in Lucine’s mind. He clenches the shield of truth and the sword of truth, and he is low and angry: “Gonno? Lord of Hell?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder this mysterious sect hidden in the northern church can perform magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder they can confuse clergy and develop a large number of believers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the Lord of Hell knows so deeply about the Church of Truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gano? Hey, people who have been dead for hundreds of years, why bother to remember his name? Just a convenient and easy to steal The item is only." The corner of the mouth is tilted up. The young man in the white robe expresses his sneer without concealing. "The more the god surnamed this thing, the more people he does not understand, the more he valued it, the so-called St. Ivan, St. Alexie, all stupid idiots, neglecting the most important things, this sentence applies equally to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence, He said it was meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed the identity of the young man in the white robe, Lucien’s heart slowly sinks, and Klaus’s two substitutes have replaced the alchemy items. In the previous two wars, the possibility of escaping from the "light of judgment" attack is minimal, especially the display of the "light of judgment" is the avatar of a strong class of gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder both of them have failed to discover Him in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face to face this existence again, how can you deal with yourself without the help of the god of silver moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term communication is not over yet, the Lord of Hell stepped forward, and the right hand pointed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Light of Judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil sorcerer with filth, accept the judgment of the last scorpion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His expression was solemn, and the light of the light was lingering, and the vast pillar of light that judged all breath descended from the sky and slammed straight to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the "pronoun" of evil is more like the god of truth than anyone else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred and mighty light column is on the small and delicate shield, which stirs up countless pieces of light, and the illusory ripples around Lutheran sway, his feet deep Stepped into the black floor tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light dissipated, "Lord of Hell" praised: "It is the shield of truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And Lucien was a little relieved, and his projection or incarnation was only close to the power of the legendary peak, and he could not kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You joined forces with Silvermoon last time and gave me a big "surprise". I have been waiting for the opportunity and giving you the same 'surprise'. "The Lord of Hell said leisurely and relaxedly, as if facing a legendary magician who is rich in his body, but an ordinary person who has no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer the words, the sword of truth gripped in the right hand suddenly swayed, the silver gray sword light skyrocketed, and smashed into the Lord of Hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When necessary, I would rather blew myself, nor can I end up with Klaus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only negligence is that it is short-lived because of the soul fireplace, and it’s the same for yourself. It’s the same. Everyone is facing the soul. Mystery, in the face of the world's most subconscious reaction, the most unobtrusive fanaticism, such an arcane master is a bloody and bloody arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Grey Sword Light cut through the illusory illusion of the Lord of Hell, and squatted on Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien's pupil slammed, this is not a teleport, nor a magic or magic, but a simple speed. At the moment when the Jianguang locks out, it moves to the side at an unimaginable speed, leaving only the afterimage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the speed that will definitely cause a relativistic effect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Jianguang is only to sway yourself, not the real light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only this level, children? His magical power conflicts with my genius, and can only be slightly integrated into the power of the body, so you Can't you beat me?” “The Lord of Hell” Maldi Moss said with a constant taunting smile, his right hand raised:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chilly spear condenses out and rushes to Lucien, the sacred breath will be surrounded by a rich sense of death and solidified black and white Purified as if on the earth, the sound of the holy voice seems to ring at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear pointed the "Shield of Truth" and made a crisp and strange metal collision. Lucien began to tremble with his left hand, and the illusory ripples The land is slowing down, and the feeling of another time and space is becoming more and more indifferent, as if the two worlds are merging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attack is much stronger than the ancient mummies. Maybe the shield of truth can last for a long time, but he may not be able to support it for a minute! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the right hand of truth is again swayed, and the silver-gray sword light directly hits the seemingly undefended Lord of Hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, once again, the phantom is broken, and he is slamming the sword light in a short time at a terrible speed, but the performance is outside. Leisurely, as if walking in the garden, I walked to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swords are shining out, each figure is broken, but the leisure of the "Lord of the Lord" has not changed at all. He is a legendary deity. The hand that made Lucien holding the shield of truth was paralyzed, and it could not be how long it could be resisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was an earth-shattering roar in the back of the palace. Five legendary undead creatures with a natural disaster-like undead ocean will soon be on the battlefield, after them. There is also a wave of * legendary dead spirits coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The retreat behind is blocked, and the other direction needs to cross the 'Lord of the Lord', which is very easy to be counted by him..." Lucien's soul thoughts Analyze your current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, holding the shield of truth will make it difficult to move. Otherwise, with this shield of extreme defense, I will be able to break through the natural disasters of the dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shield of truth is similar to the "guardian of God". If you want to exert the maximum effect, you will have to be still in place, and moving is extremely inconvenient, and if you want to take care of it, Moving, Lucien had no confidence to break through the blockade of the "Lord of Hell" or the five legendary undead creatures, not to mention the follow-up legendary necromancer coming from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time blocking a magical attack, Lucien’s sight and mental field constantly searched around, suddenly, his eyes condensed on the “soul fireplace” The one-piece or quiet or awkward soul face looks at himself with a condescending feeling, giving himself a sense of horror that stands cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his head and getting rid of this feeling, Lucien suddenly got the idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to Ador's memory and Viken's notes, only a few of the legendary undead have dared to cross the soul fireplace, and the rest did not dare to approach... The soul fireplace is not blocked nearby. If you run away, the threat of the undead natural disaster is temporarily No, and the 'Lord of the Hell' may not chase me. After all, he can't make it possible for me to expose Gono, which is an uneconomical business for the devil. He must have a bigger plot. Or purpose..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the time does not coincide with his sneak direction, it should not provoke his pursuit, and if I hide in the soul Near the fireplace, if you don't explore it in depth, you won't encounter Maskilin's trapped things. When the time of the gods is over, the speaker and the teacher will come to look for me, or they will lead the undead, I will be able to Take the opportunity to get out of trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear palace was filled with a wave of * undead in the big hole that the ancient mummies smashed. There are bone dragons, lichs, ghosts, and two ancient mummies that are also wrapped in yellow-brown bandages. Their red eyes are full of demon. Different cold colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no wonder that Muskilllin would say that he often sees the ancient mummies’ kind face..." Lucien said, no time to go. Considering it, I made up my mind in an instant to put away the sword of truth in the right hand and replaced it with a delicate and complicated "monthly timepiece." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi's thumb swiftly slides on the silver-white dial, and the time around a large range of time flies with the chaos of the black second hand, a The arrow that shot to Lucien, a magical magic, like a broken kite, drifting around, completely lost the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Lord of Hell" was also affected, and the action became distorted, like a puppet with broken joints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Lucien put away the shield of truth, lifted the transformation, it is necessary to accurately transfer to the direction of the soul fireplace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the Temple of the Dead, due to the chaos of time and space, the transmission distance is quite limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "Lord of the Lord" mouth was lifted again, and the deep ridicule meant that it was untouched: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Light of Judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just lie to you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have been immune to the time to escape, immune to advanced time to stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements bless!" Lucien had only time to read the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the infinite number of angels surrounded by the mighty light hitting Lucien, the colorful elements shield the mask from the short-term support and are torn apart, elemental skin When the stress is on, the spell absorbing device madly devours the energy, and the spell sequence throws three stone skins. The magical field wall in the spell sequencer constitutes the final defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, under the light of judgment, Lucien’s defense was broken in layers, and suddenly he disappeared into the same place and flashed on the other side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the protection of elements and the protection of many triggers and passive magic, Lucien finally resisted the "light of judgment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the undead natural disaster, the hidden centaur looks like an undead creature raises his hand and shoots a long green arrow, traversing through heavy space, momentarily Shot in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Barrier of the Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ring of Congers has a black glow, countless souls And the body constitutes a wall of the dead, offsetting this legendary long arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are so many legendary items, otherwise it will be too late to defend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Hell has crossed the caster's buffer, and the reddish-eyed eyes mocked Luthion, who is about to cast a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can't take care of the other, the middle finger gently presses the button on the left side of the month, a group of hemispherical black voids shrouded the Lord of Hell He pressed him to solidify for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he read the mantra in his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling king's stick is condensed in the left hand of Lucien, and with its lightness, the surrounding time and space slows again, greatly slowing down, the undead The actions of natural disasters and legendary undead creatures have become stuck, and it is not known what the resulting space shackles are directly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space fluctuations occur, Lucien accurately transmitted to the soul fireplace, without hesitation through the gray curtain, it has no time to study this implication The transcendental thing of the mystery of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien had a strange feeling, like someone on the soul fireplace is watching himself, high above, cold and indifferent Watching yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
