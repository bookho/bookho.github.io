			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many difficulties and obstacles, a little sunshine finally penetrated the dark clouds and fog filled with cracks in the sky, piercing the dense canopy and branches, in the dark and cold There is a golden spot in the mountains. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, a thick right foot in a knight’s boot is stepping on a gold spot One of the dead branches hidden in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following wolfman Nasdell was slightly surprised to think: "How can the prince of the king control the power of his own feet, is he thinking about what is important? Question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who walks in front is the Werewolf Prince Dubnaar, who has a silver-gray short hair, a good-looking, full-faced flying cockroach, one Look is an epic knight who is good at melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal is wearing a black, strange armor that is neither as bulky as a full-body armor nor a piece of small armor. And the craft of the "leather", he played with a piece of gold bluestone, sea bream and sun stone, with an inscrutable tone: "Nasdell, are you surprised?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Prince, how do you know?" Nasdell blurted out in amazement, and the prince of the prince could guess what he thought in his mind without using extraordinary power. It is the best wise man of the werewolf family, the most embarrassing conspirators! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal narrowed his eyes and looked forward to the light column that came in from the dense foliage. It was so bright and clear that it seemed to see the number inside. The dust is flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that you must be surprised at why I don't go directly to the 'flamestone valley' through the 'gate of the outer world', but walk slowly in the forest. Dubnaar said in the peculiar tone of the "wise man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Flamestone Valley" is the headquarters of the Dark Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I’m just amazed at how you can’t control your own strength, and so on, I’m not surprised at all, why the Prince’s Lord will choose the way to walk, this It takes several hours to reach the Valley of the Flames! Oh, I am too far apart from the vast and profound wisdom of the Prince of the Sea. Even the most obvious anomaly has not been discovered. . I also have the prince to take the initiative to open my finger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nasdall, who has always been self-proclaimed as clever, first stunned, and then understood the "good intentions" of His Excellency the Prince, half of which is self-defeating, and half is touched by inexplicable I sincerely admire the Prince: "Yes. Lord Prince. I am really surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha, Dubner laughed silently, you The mind is really good to guess, other book friends are watching: As the most wise and wise Prince of the Werewolf family, I will know by random reasoning: "This meeting was jointly proposed by Danisos and Dracula. I hope that the parliament will be integrated into a unified order, no longer like the former. In that way, there is no binding force on the forces of the parties. The devil has the goal of robbing the devil. The eyes and the devil have the idea of ​​the eye, and they start guilty without paying attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good thing as a whole, but it is not necessarily for us werewolves. Because only one of us and Sony has reached the legendary level, compared to the seven Taikoo dragons and vampires of the dragon family. The four first generations are really far apart. Moreover, both Sony and I have been stagnant in the legendary third-order, without the peak level of Danisos and Dracula. If integrated, we might become damn The vampires' 'slaves'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the princes’ sorrows, the analysis clearly analyzes the future and situation of the werewolves, Nasdell’s eyes Bright, the heart is both worried and worried. Thanks exception. Prince Sonic and other lords always ridiculed that their princes are full of muscles, bloodthirsty and brutal, and they will not think at all. Can you listen to these words, can they tell them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf family has several princes, but only two of them have reached the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernard’s expression became solemn: “So I chose to walk to give myself a time to think and think about how we were able to get rid of such a werewolf. Difficulties, get enough benefits from this thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the tall back of the Prince, Nasdell feels sore nose and eyes, Too touching, such a strong werewolf can not control the mood, the Prince is really the conscience and hope of our werewolf family, is our savior. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is a complicated and difficult problem, not so easy to solve..." Dubnaar became heavy. Suddenly, his nose was pumping and he said: "I smell a strange smell." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliar taste? A stranger who can safely reach the depths of this dark mountain? Nasdell felt that the wolf hair of his body had signs of standing up, but as soon as he saw the majestic back of the Prince, he was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal suddenly turned his head, and the figure flew forward. The huge wind blew up and blown the towering trees directly, revealing the distance. The lake that swayed the micro-microwave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the edge of the lake, where the wind is blowing, "time and space" is like a sway of water, a figure is slowly protruding, he is wearing a black double-breasted long dress, wearing The same color top hat, holding a delicate and complicated silver and white pocket watch in the right hand, it is Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was not surprised and panicked, but gently nodded, the legendary level of the werewolf's keen sense of the surrounding environment changes is extraordinary, even more than the parliamentary books The record is still exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal’s silver-gray short hair roots erect, his mouth open, a sharp spike grows out, and the golden eyes are dyed a layer Silver white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is half-flexed, like a long bow full of strength, entangled dozens of hundreds of shadows around his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s eyes are shining, and the silver layer suddenly disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark forest, a cold cold moon rises and hangs in the treetops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bright moon, the hundreds of black shadows spread out and flew from all directions to Lucien. Some were like real shadows, and they swam against the ground. Some are like black crows, flying from the air, while others are like real werewolves, waving their claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the black shadow spread out, Du Bernal lost his trace, it seems that every black shadow can become him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luxury big crack!" Lucien will give a hand and a spell will be sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪啪, the black shadows are broken without any resistance, and they are integrated into the darkness that the moonlight cannot shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the shadow of Lucien’s feet was alive and turned into a burly wolf, with his claws swaying to Lucien with a hint of silver. body of,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernard’s previous black shadows are all cover up, this is his fatal blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, when he saw the beautiful mysterious pocket watch, he heard a crisp sound, and then he couldn’t see anything, just like being locked in another A world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, Dubnaar seems to have something broken, bursting with silver, and the cold moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the surrounding gray became fresh and the various colors returned, but there was no such figure in Dubnaar’s sight. It’s just the ethereal sound of “spiritual whistling” from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal feels like he has been put an alchemy bomb in his mind, and the huge roar makes him dizzy and can no longer maintain balance, at the same time, His thoughts became dull, and the soul could hardly contain the earthquake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an epic knight, his instinct allowed him to lie down on the ground regardless of his image, tumbling and jumping in the shadows, avoiding subsequent attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." A gentle laugh came from the forest next to him, "Du Bernal, I don’t think you have such awkwardness, if not Mr. Evans. Without killing you, you can't be so complete now, whether it's 'forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow,' or the antimatter spell that hurts the 'Lord of the Hell', you are not able to resist."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice, a dark, four-clawed kitten emerged from the forest, lying on the ground lazily, playing with his belly, behind it A girl who seems to be sick and sick is floating in the air. Her facial features are delicate and delicate, wearing a robe with a strong ancient magical empire style, which is covered with complex and mysterious patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
