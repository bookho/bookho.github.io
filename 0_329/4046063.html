			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a more introverted, not good at expressing emotions. Lucien, through the piano, through music, for the first time, his inner emotions thoroughly and completely It is manifested in the reluctance of life, the persistence of ideals and feelings, the uncompromising difficulty and frustration, the never giving up, and the stubborn struggle against the so-called destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong emotions drive the music, even in the middle, because of the incompetence of piano skills, the incompleteness of the strings, etc., let Lucien play and There are many problems in the music, but the music with emotional resonance completely covers them. Every note and every string is like a fierce battle. It is a heroic fight, listening to five different moods and different emotions. The audience is equally immersed in this powerful, stirring music atmosphere but with different performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice has the most slender emotions, her hands are almost twisted and distorted, her nervousness and uneasiness in her face, her father failed to inherit the title, because The ridicule and contempt of the companions and other relatives, after hesitating for a long time, did not give up the future, to find a nobleman to marry, but to start the music with awkwardness, with tension and uneasiness, the fierce notes Like the difficulties and frustrations that he has often encountered and dreamed of in recent years, they have come in unrelenting and stormy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I overcome these difficulties? Become a real musician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can have Can you choose your partner instead of being chosen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the excitement of the string, Felice is getting more and more nervous, and more and more Heartless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lotus and Herodotus as men, the pressure on the family is far greater than Felice, the biggest possibility of not inheriting the title is to escape the pressure Squandering an annuity, indulging in fine wine and women, living a comfortable but not hopeful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repeated, horrible theme chords came in and made them think of the difficulties and frustrations they encountered after choosing their music path, a sentence Satire and blow, one by one, scornful eyes, as they say, this life can only become a musician, live an ordinary and ordinary life, or overcome countless difficulties and obstacles to climb the peak of the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly as if the trembling notes could strike their hearts, Lott’s hands were covered with a blue blood vessel, as if Makcanz was in front of him. Zhang’s disgusting face seems to be about to start his first concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Herodotus, whose name is slightly weaker, feels that he is beating in the face of the raging tide of destiny, with a nervous and distorted face, step by step Moved behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine face often lost his grace with an elegant smile, the silver eyes are no longer calm, but with the music stirring, he followed his hands The string slaps the beat and whispers to himself: "Is this the fate knocking at the door? Oh, there has been no such intense emotion for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most excited The most addicted is Victor. He clenched his hands and looked mad. He shook his body with every fierce string, as if he had thought of his first concert that failed. He thought of reviving his wife’s comfort and encouragement. I have asked many people, got countless ridicules and blindfolds, and finally got the chance of a second concert and achieved great success;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought of my wife’s death In a decadent life, in order to fulfill his wife’s wish, he just walked out of the mud and became a great musician, winning the opportunity to hold a concert in the Shengli Hall;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought of burning all the enthusiasm and fineness for the concert. However, in the last step of failure, nine years of hard work failed to write the works in mind; thought of Wolfe's malicious mockery and revenge, and the seriousness and arrogance of Baron Othello...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this turned into a fierce note like a sharp arrow, bursting like a hammering string, attacking and pounding Victor's heart, let him yield Let him give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the unyielding in the string, the persistence of struggles with difficulties and frustrations, the reluctance to compromise on fate, makes Victor a strong Fighting spirits:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have failed so many times to be able to reinvigorate, can this failure be able to beat me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wennie, are you encouraging me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first movement of the Symphony of Destiny is about seven minutes and twenty seconds, full of stormy strings. When Lucien played for more than five minutes, she felt that her body was weak, and her hands began to be weak. I understood that this was a wound that I had not healed. It was the sequela of the overwhelming physical strength in the heavy rain, and my heart could not help but produce anyway. They have played so much, they should be able to hear the good and bad, no need to reluctantly play the idea, but this idea was immediately rejected by Lucien and the music resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you want to play, you can show it completely, how can you give up?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I To encourage Mr. Victor to chase hope, how can he go halfway and return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien strong support heavy press, the string is like on the wire The walking person may fall at any time, listening to Victor and Lot and others are more worried, more nervous, and even Felic and Herodotus can not help but hold the heart with the right hand. Fortunately, the next step is a soothing string, paving the way for the end of the first movement. Lucien is not so intense, he can seize the opportunity to recover. A little, then burst out of strong notes, stirring strings, they repeat the superposition, the cycle increases, and then suddenly stop, let Felice and other people shake the body, the spirit produces a trace of exhaustion, the fierce battle is always like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief calm, Lucien started playing the second movement, a soothing string of passages, like a sun through the storm , dispelling a lot of haze, the wind and the waves are short-term pauses; on the battlefield of fierce fighting, the soldiers rushed back to their camps, and the battle entered a calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This string is like a healing agent, healed all the bleeding wounds, and like the warm hands and arms of his loved ones, healed the inner wounds after fighting with destiny. Let the look of Victor, Felice and others recover, no longer so mad and distorted. It seems that the soldiers got a break and began to accumulate strength and think about methods for future battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a gentle and inspiring string of encouragement, Lucien himself has the opportunity to regain strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed quickly, more than ten minutes in the soothing string and the previous powerful music contrast, unwittingly spent, and short-lived calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien began the third and fourth movements of continuous performance, the string began to transform, becoming oppressive and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun disappears, the haze reappears, the sky is dark, the sea is calm, it seems to be brewing a bigger wind and waves; and the battlefield is refilled with dark clouds, dangerous And the horrible fight will begin again, and the soldiers took up their weapons and went back to the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a string, so that Victor and others began to worry about the subconscious, began to wait nervously for the final battle and the arrival of the biggest storm, the stringing of the paragraph, the mood A little bit of accumulation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm finally struck, the fishing boat was lifted high, and it let it fall, full of fateful play and contempt; and on the battlefield, fight again Heroic and fearless, as if to defeat the invincible destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After and again, the fishing boat has been ruined everywhere, and it will fall apart at any time, but the storm seems to be coming to an end;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Failures again and again, did not let the soldiers desperate to give up, but more full of fighting spirit, firm and steady to force the enemy back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third movement enters the last part, the string is calm again, with a touch of sadness and melancholy, as if the fighting soldiers are hurting their dead companions I miss my loved ones, as if the sailors are thinking about the beautiful scenes in their lives, mourning the friends swallowed by the raging waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkest hour before dawn came, with an extremely unstable atmosphere, letting Lott, Herodotus and others nervous again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a failure or a victory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you defeating difficulties and setbacks, or being knocked down by difficulties and setbacks, and you can no longer stand up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
