			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the semi-substantial cognitive world of Lucien, the bright and sinister star of the destiny violently turned, and the deep black hole walked from the back to the front, and distributed It seems as if it can swallow all the horror suction, let the surrounding light faintly bend, the time seems to slow down, and all the sensory snoops and sights are slightly offset from the original track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are words of prayer in the mouth, Lucian looks very solemn, and suddenly, "the kind of spiritual surname" is like the old man who met the food, the lion dog When he came to the bloody prey, he rushed into the chest of Lucien and violently ignited the solitude and purity of the cold, and covered him all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is he so arrogant with the moon field?" El sensed the change in Lucien, and the slight deviation made him think it was before. The perfect kind of thing and the kind of spiritual surname, so after a little surprised, I took back my eyes and nodded with satisfaction. No matter how long Liviathan joined the secret prayer meeting, he accepted the kind of spiritual surname and is a trustworthy precept. Now, take advantage of his talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jacob also looked away with a little horror, their performance, let Francis converge with a thoughtful smile, and become careless again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinyue Guanghua dissipated, Lu Xien was more quiet and deep, and then waved his fist in the demonstration, unsurprisingly leaving a shadow in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your physique is very suitable for the kind of spiritual surname in the moon field, and the effect is the best." Elben wanted to say that the effect exceeded expectations, but thought of himself. It is the supreme Lord. It is impossible to make any effect on the kind of spiritual surname that he has made. Therefore, he temporarily changed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob also echoed: "I see your momentum and the action of just throwing a punch, which is comparable to a medium-blood hero. You are now the real seventh." "The disciples!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the gift of the Lord." Lucien seems to be influenced by the kind of spiritual surname, the temperament is quieter and the joy is not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El nodded, and raised the species of Jacob’s spiritual name, which brought him to the level of about six peaks, and then sighed slightly: It is a pity that I have completely destroyed the rule of the underworld, or else I can search for His Divine and absorb the name of the Death God from his embodiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He I have already believed that I am the master of the underworld who can only kill myself. Therefore, for the gods, if the body is destroyed, the avatar will die at the same time unless there is a very special way to isolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien 腮 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 微 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路 路When the river bottom was swimming, due to the influence of the tide, the constellation dominated by the underworld was discovered by chance, and there may be his remaining treasures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to seal the subject to a space that is self-distorted. Unless the strength exceeds the caster or the caster, it can be forced to break by force. If the seal cannot be broken, it will be permanently locked there, even if it is distorted. The space returns to normal as the magical effect disappears, and the subject will be lost in the space maze, either destroyed by the space storm or never liberated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is only for the subject, but he can reveal the power, leave the message, ask someone to help, at this time, as long as If you know the location of the seal or determine it by prophecy, you can use the opposite nine-ring magic free technique to crack the imprisonment. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, using the sun scepter’s own imprisonment to help El to get rid of the danger, Lucien is very clear that the underworld dominates the body that is imprisoned, and the avatar does not Under any influence, at most the strength is relatively weakened due to weakening of contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His divine domain is at the bottom of the Solna River? Is it not the death valley at the source of the Solna River?" Elpo was surprised to ask, as Once the main god of the Babul gods, he probably guessed the position of the gods dominated by the underworld. "Is it because he fears my revenge, so it is a pity that the gods are removed. The death valley is very suitable for the field of death and the underworld, or, Before this debate, he had already reached an agreement with the Lord of War, so he was very reluctant to move the domain to this place. Does this mean that the war masters arrived in Husum early and held a theological conference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not doubt that "devout Leviathan" will deceive himself in this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afando (El), who used to like treasure and beauty in the past, has been able to restrain his own desires after "waking up the self" and burning his ambitions. Nothing is more important than re-boarding to the throne. Ownership, will you worry about not having treasures and beauty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, El Hehe laughed and threw the rotten laurel box to Lucien: "You like the treasure so much, I will reward you some It is also a reward for your dedication."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a look at the bottom of the semi-rotted moonlight box with a layer of fine silver powder. It seems that El is the residue left after the name of the god of the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is actually the moon stone powder..." Lucine is quite surprised in the heart, this is the same material as the best moonstone, cryolite, and dead stone. Named by the magicians with the moon god, it is precious, and more importantly, it can be used to repair the Ice and Snow Medal and the Immortal Throne Robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original road to Sean is going to find the best cryolite and dead soul stone to repair these two magic items, but the use of Luna stone powder is obviously better, the success rate higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile of Francis’s mouth is slightly solidified, as if there is a dim sum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For El’s ambition, Jacob cautiously said: “But we still have to be careful that these false gods are fully committed to the Lord of War and set traps for themselves. We waited for a while, waiting for the patience of the Lord of War to lose, and then carefully looking for the target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." El nodded and smiled. : "Leviathan is smart, young, talented, sensible and motivated. Francis is strong, knowledgeable, eloquent, and far-reaching. Jacob is cautious, doing things in an orderly manner, and is good at making up for loopholes. The three of you just complement each other. It is the best help for me to restore myself and return to the highest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately paused, waiting for Francis to express his piety: "Francis you propose I am very satisfied with the order of the angels. You are the highest angels who follow me. Blazing angels, Francis, your strength is more than destruction and death. Then you can be called the 'death angel' who replaces me for soul trial. Judging angels', 'just angels'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jacob you first follow me and spread my way, so you are a 'revelation angel', too Called 'Redeemer Angel', Leviathan, you are the youngest disciple, full of vigor, just like the early morning star, representing the glory of the coming, therefore, you are the 'Glorious Angel', also known as the 'Dawn Star', 'The Son of Dawn'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart is slightly worried, how come to this heterodyne space, he can not get rid of the "fallen morning star" related. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I return to the Divine Realm, consolidate the name of God and the priesthood, Jacob returns to the city of Bethtan, arranges missionary matters, and sends other disciples and believers to assist Francis monitors other false gods, records their whereabouts, and prepares for future killings. Leviathan waits for Amish in the second place you have agreed to, and secretly returns to Beritan with him, and begins secret missionary along the way. "Ill gave up the gods and assigned the mission. Because Lucien "can't fly," he stayed with Andus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to follow the Lord's God." Francis, Jacob, and Lucien answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When El, Jacob, and Francis flew away, Lucien was relieved, and Francis gave him the most pressure. Relax a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, confirming that no one killed a "returning carbine", Lucien touched his chest and pulled out a silver-colored medal with a pattern. Flashing cold moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the secret prayer meeting, Lucien knew about the kind of gift given to the spiritual surname. After joining the conference, he was repeatedly mentioned to him. How can you not prepare for a cautious surname? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the information in the secret prayer meeting, after understanding the general situation, in relation to the false gods, which can engulf the soul and the body, Lu Xien imitates the foundation of the shackles The structure used a medium-upper material that could be collected to refine a semi-finished product. Although it was not really understood at the time what the meaning of this part of the structure was, Lu Xien had a lot of confidence to absorb the kind of spiritual surname. Let the alchemy items really finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing some of the truths about the surnames of the gods and the names of the souls, Lucien is truly in control of that part of the structure, and confidence becomes full. It would be a good time to watch the Francis absorbing the surname of the soul without rushing, instead of making excuses and reasons to postpone it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
