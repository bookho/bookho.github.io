With the feedback of "land heaven", Anthony understands that Hathaway has completely suppressed Sant'Anasta and St. Augusta. In addition to the "artifact", all items, effects and bodies are destroyed under the "luxury cracking" and "decomposition of elements". The destruction and damage were damaged, and the battle was both painful and uncomfortable. If there was not a light-covered body, it almost showed the light and clean body of the Lord in front of the believers in Rentt City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that after relying on the past, the "luxury crack" and "elemental decomposition" have come to the end of the tragic end, Anthony felt that he should stop Oliver Close together, although this way, the Arcanists are in the same range, easy to be killed by the Pope, but the effect of "Luxury Big Split" can only be blocked or weakened by a few magics and magic, such as legend The magical "Sacred Blessing", and he is a holy knight, how could he use such a high level of magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparatively speaking, Oliver, who is not "luxury big cracking", is much more "cute". The nine-ring "big cracking" can rely on magic resistance. Hard support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in my heart just flashed, he found that the other side of the "ice witch" Helen is also in the same situation with Oliver, she is also close to Hathaway The "Holy Avengers" of St. Mermos, who witnessed this situation, forced the storm to dominate the past to Hathaway, trying to connect the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"St. Melmos has been at the peak of legend for many years, although it is not comparable to Douglas, but defeating Fernando is only a matter of time. If it is close, he must have Ability to help us end the battle ahead of time, and so many people are mixed together, Hathaway may not dare to use 'luxury big crack', this is a range of spells, regardless of the enemy and friends, even if it can not win in a short time, it is enough They suppressed it and waited for the Pope to return to give him a fatal blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony changed his previous thoughts and quietly slowed his offense into a ray of light, let Oliver successfully transferred the position and appeared near the "Elemental Dominator" Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four Arcanists opened the scuffle of the five saints, and Anthony received the magical blessings of St. Anasta and Santa Maria. Strength, speed, attack power, and defense power are once again improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not as magical as unpredictable, life-saving methods emerge in an endless stream, but in the gain class effect, the magic is undoubtedly better than magic, so the more It is a group battle. The more fierce this party has, the priest of the Holy Spirit, whether it is Anthony himself or Melmos, the "bright" and "morning" are brought to the extreme, shining a region and putting four great arcans. Suppressed, it seems that it will take a long time to get the final victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why Anthony finally decided to indulge Oliver to close, but with the support of Hathaway, the annihilation hand and the ice witch have not weakened for the time being. The situation that has been accumulated may be better for them than before. "Fall dominates" Fernando and "Elemental Dominator" Hathaway fall into an embarrassing situation and can barely support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Fernando’s eyes jumped in the lightning, the storm emerged, and whispered to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Storm Enchantment"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming "Thunder Hell" expands, destroying the world's black storm, snake-like lightning, blending all the high temperatures, close to absolute zero The coldness of the cold rolled up the five saints of Mermos and Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the raging storm, the surrounding became dark, the horrible strong magnetic field twisted the space, the whistling voice shouted with a strong destruction, blocking the five The saints left, indulging Oliver, Helen, and Hathaway flying upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on his semi-planetary legendary magic, is one of the two fundamental magics of his legendary career! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver and Helen, who flew out, each took a side and read a short mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Space shackles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the strong magnetic field is twisted and black, and the space begins to solidify, like a transparent crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hathaway flew a little higher and stopped, silver-gray eyes coldly and ruthlessly looking at Fernando and the five saints below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forcibly broke the storm enchantment, and I and Anasta killed Fernando!" Melmos smelled the wrong atmosphere and made a decision. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexel Palace, in the House of Nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All nobles are quiet and ready to listen to Her Majesty’s statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Qingyue’s voice becomes low, exuding the majesty of the king:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , Natasha Vauririt, Queen of Holm Kingdom, Lord of the Knights of Truth, ruling the lord of the Knights, the lord of the Holy Cross, decided to join forces with the Magic Council to expel the radical church and use the moderate sect as the state religion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong without any hesitation, he has been hesitated by many aristocrats. They are used to surnamed the king, and they will not be in the essence of the Magic Council. There will also be a new balance in the loss of the surname's interests, especially the enlightened aristocrats. After Natasha's words, they quickly unified their thoughts and made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha continues to speak vigorously and vigorously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want my subjects to be able to Sleep well, at any time, you will be worried about being assassinated by the radical watchman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want my subjects to lose their wealth and vitality, and the Holy See is bound by thought, we Everyone has the right to interpret the Holy Scriptures, and each of us should be able to feel the Lord who is always in the heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to The situation in the Kingdom of Holm has returned to the dark and obscured state. We humans have reason and must enjoy a better life, whether it is a magical crystal lamp that brings light, or a small telephone, a more convenient telephone telegram, radio. There are no doubts about alchemy items, and the road ahead of us will be closely related to the Magic Council!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My subjects, what is your choice? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the nobles are silent in the House Hall, as if they are in the heart Intense struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the nobles of the Kingdom of Colette, the Kingdom of Burrian, the Principality of Calais, the aristocrats who listened to the live broadcast were only slightly embarrassed and used to The elegant and tasteful life brought by the alchemy items, it seems a bit unacceptable to return to the past. As for the deterrence of the royal power, they have their own king or lord, the assassination of the radical night watchman, they have never experienced it, so they cannot produce Feeling the same feelings, still can not make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hammer of the Void" Bedrenka and the "Disaster Knight" Bassol looked at each other and shook his head at Natasha’s speech. Still, there is no thing that can impress both of them and impress most of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nexus Palace, the House Speaker, Duke Rex, stood up again, screaming: "I oppose!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before all the nobles stated their position, before the resolution was formed, Her Majesty should not make a decision!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Especially this A key moment involves everyone's life and death. Anyone who violates the will of the aristocrats is a traitor to the aristocracy and is no longer suitable to be a lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not decide the queen's decision at this moment, and then he continued: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope may be coming soon, we can make a decision so hastily "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you want to break into hell after death, can't climb Mount Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Duke of James got up and retorted: "Look outside, look at Richard, they can use the magic, and raise the level, this is the will of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Seeing that the enlightened aristocrats and the conservative aristocrats have to argue again, Natasha raised her hand again and suppressed her:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not finished "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando read again after the storm enchantment Mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True imaginary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, he became six They were intercepted before the five saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Light of Judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the evil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augusta and others use the power of the gods or the magical powers to make three Fernando The annihilation, and then tried to break the storm enchantment, and Melmos and Anasta will deal with the other three Fernando, and soon broke the imitation, completely suppressing Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of Allinge in the sky is suddenly separated, a huge energy group shines with a free fall of light, in which it seems to wrap things in water It exudes a heart-wrenching horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loss of this light group, and Allen’s fascination suddenly faded a lot, and even the flight became difficult, leaving Warren Hill out of trouble, but this time A cold female voice rang: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silent Dark Blue." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air and the light around him are all frozen, as if the time has stopped, everything is in a silent, cold blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice Witch Helen took time to trap him with his legendary magic, and then continued to concentrate on the storm enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the huge ball of light wrapped in water, the delicate but lacking expression of Hathaway reveals a hint of intoxicating color. A lengthy mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mystery from inside the atom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth sound Like a holy shrine, but in St. Mermo's ear, but like a lament, his keen insincere raises an inexplicable sense of horror and danger, and can't take care of others. The whole person turns into a morning light and goes to Fernando with Jianguang. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Anasta did not hesitate to display the light of judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony, St. Mary's three saints finally broke the strong magnetic distortion of the outer layer of the storm enchantment, but before they could break through the space shackles, the ear Two voices sounded:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destroy the ball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wrath of the Snow Goddess" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destroy all the dark black balls and the horrible cold ice that was blocked in front of them, so they had to concentrate on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando faced the attack of Melmos, but he did not care, read the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Steep turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of him there is a mirror full of countless patterns, as if there is another world behind it, the light of judgment is on it. Directly deflected in the past, almost hit Anasta himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the legendary advancement of the Seven Ring Magic "Spell Inversion", which can bounce five single spell damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this could not stop Melmos, the Holy Avengers eliminated the evil forces and smashed him from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
