			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night sky is dark and deep, and numerous stars are embellished. Lucien once again uses the star power of meditation to temper the spirit and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these stars, the star power line from the star of its own destiny is the clearest and the easiest to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit is a little bit of pure starlight, and spread to the soul, so that the soul seems to emit a faint glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of light slowly blends into the soul, and Lucien only feels that his soul is strong enough to be able to feel the speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a high-level magic apprentice, the growth and power of spiritual power and soul are so obvious, so the witch will only be used for a year, from the trainee magic Apprentices became high-ranking, and on this, Lucien was no slower than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the action of storm potions, Lucien’s mental power is stronger than usual, so the mastery of the stars and the stars used to temper themselves More than usual, soon, Lucien’s soul has a feeling of fullness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this feeling of fullness, there is also a force to expand outward, which makes Lucien see the opportunity, did not stop the meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul seems to swell and shrink, and the star power is compressed with itself. Finally, Lucien first discovered that the soul seems thick and solid. Illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of meditation, the illusion disappears, but Lucien feels that his mind is more sober than ever, knowing that he has finally become an official magic apprentice, the soul has others Unexplained a little variation, in the future can effectively weaken the control of the mind, chaos spirit, suppression of the will, the recovery speed is nearly doubled than before, and the mental power sensor is blurred by a very vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But such a breakthrough, the damage to the body is really not small, even if you insist on exercising, but if you can not become a formal magician in the future, use magic means to prolong life, I am really afraid that I will live less than sixty years old. The disappearance of the potential of the stormy drug overdraft has made Lucien a deep exhaustion and weakness, and once again checked into his own situation, he fell into deep sleep again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming an official magic apprentice, Lucien’s spirit will usher in a period of rapid growth until the high-order magic apprentice is a small obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, in the "original author" of Lucien With the help, Victor smoothly perfected the melody and details, and adapted it into a symphony. Then the band, through repeated practice, and the assistance of the excellent performer of the Rhine, finally played the music skillfully when Othello came to listen. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the Symphony of Destiny, Othello stood up in the empty auditorium and screamed for a long time: "Before the melody could not accurately judge this The value of the music, but now I am relieved, this must be a sensational music, once again, Victor, you have a good student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, Lucien, you are indeed an imaginary genius, but genius is always subject to criticism, especially if you can't even play the piano. If you can't keep it every two years, write it. With the rhythm of a great work, you are ready to face the overwhelming questions and criticisms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a good thing to be famous too early." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello is still a pity that Lucien did not put his musical talent into serious religious subjects, shook his head and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the back of Othello disappeared in the hall of the concert hall, Victor slyly said to Lucien: "The day I was hit by this piece of music." I am too excited and too impulsive, although no one will doubt your plagiarism, although genius does not need a reason, but I have not considered the pressure that will bring you too early to become famous."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, Mr. Victor, I have a tough heart, and pressure will only give me motivation." Although Lucien himself does not want to be too early, but since it has reached this point, it is better to be good. Use this reputation, at least you can start to contact the upper class, do not want to buy moonlight rose powder and no place to buy, perhaps rely on this reputation to earn Jintal, to create conditions for their magic learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking about this, Victor continued: "Two days later, you and Lott followed me to the backstage of the St. Hall, and as the creator of the music, if you want, you can invite some friends to the concert, but the number Not too much, staying below five people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Hall Concert is only for the upper class, and the ticket is equivalent to one civilian for one to two years. Savings, that is, a Jintal, but will leave a certain number of seats for musicians, conductors, performers, etc., so that their relatives and friends can participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? That's great." Thinking of Uncle Joel's wish, Lucien answered with pleasure, because he didn't know when he would leave St. I don’t know if I have a chance to hold a concert in the Hall of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien himself does not feel sorry, he will even breathe a sigh of relief, but if he can meet Joel’s wish now, Lucien will certainly be very Happy, "Uncle Joel, Eliza, John, Avon, plus Elena, just five people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s small living room, Lucien’s dinner time, brought things out: “Uncle Joel, Eliza, Evan, This is the case. My teacher, Mr. Victor, will hold a concert in the Shengli Hall on Saturday night, so I can invite some friends to participate. Are you willing to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Holy Hall? Is it really ok?" Eliza said with excitement. Listening to a concert in the Hall of the Holy Grail is the dream of every Aalto, expensive tickets and incognito discrimination. It is impossible for the poor people of Eliza and most of the civilians to enter the hall of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien nodding his head, Joel is pleased but puzzled: "Isn’t the only relatives and friends of musicians invited?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the musician’s student’s friends are also OK...” Eliza thought of reason for Lucien, and Ai Wen’s eyes glowed: “Go to the Holy Hall. Listening to the concert? I must be the most enviable child in the Adejan area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thinks that every guest who attends the concert will get a The music list, which will be labeled with the name of the track, the composer, the adaptor, etc., therefore did not conceal the answer: "I helped Mr. Victor complete a work, so I am qualified to invite my friends."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You? Help Mr. Victor complete a work?" Joel, as a bard, knows more about the difficulty of creating a piece of music than Alice and Ivan. The wooden fork fell on the table. "Little Evans, really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to say: "Little Evans, lying is not a good habit." But thinking of Lucien's performance all the time, it is not like people who lie about this kind of thing, so simply ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not explain, smiled and said: "Uncle Joel, you will know when you arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Joer shook his head and smiled: "Little Evans, you grew up, have your own secrets, although I still can't believe it, but maybe our little Evans is really a musical genius? We have to go Rent a few dresses, wait for the beginning of the concert, and wait for your performance to create a piece of music. I don't think you will let me down." Without hearing the music, Joel's surprise soon recovered, looking forward with a dubious attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s face was ruddy, as if she was young, and then a little worried: “We will tell John, but he doesn’t know if he can come, It would be a shame if you missed the performance of your first piece of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And for Lucian’s invitation, Elena, who has accepted him to create a great work, is very happy, nod hesitating and nodded, for her wishing to develop on the music road, the holy hall concert The meaning is even more significant, and it shows that Lucien is really treating himself as a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday, 8 pm, outside the hall, The carriage slowly came, and the carts were all powerful and powerful dragon scale horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
