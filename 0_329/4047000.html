			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wasteland, weeds grow, and there are many bones everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small business group, under the protection of more than a dozen mercenaries, traveled through this dangerous area and headed for the Kingdom of Buriana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wilderness is the junction of the Kingdom of Holm and the Kingdom of Burriana, surrounded by mountains, magical creatures are rampant, and there are rumors nearby It was the “Governor of the Greater Holm District” and the “Disaster King” Viken’s territory hundreds of years ago. He is not stationed in Rentat, like the previous governors, and is close to Arthur. The edge of the empire is conducting its own experiments. Therefore, there are many strange creatures on this wilderness. It is said to be the defective product of Viken's experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after Viken’s disappearance, the powerful magicians, including his disciples, did not find his “half-face entrance”. So no one knows why he is missing, and no one has his inheritance and magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many magicians are sighing, a magician who is said to be close to the legendary peak, a bloody researcher, his half-face There must be unimaginable wealth and knowledge, but it is annihilated in the long river of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are always a lot of similar stories, even today, the wilderness and the mountains are also wandering a lot of adventurers who want to get the Wicken treasure." Mercenary squad Hassan, the deputy captain, disdained and said to his subordinates. "They don't think about their ass. Even if the goddess of fortune is blessed, they really found the half-face entrance of Viken, and they have the strength to get the treasure from it. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicken's title is 'Disaster King', good at blood research and ** transformation. I dare to bet with this bag of wine, his half There are definitely mutant monsters in the face and magic tower that are close to the legendary strength. Hey, maybe the half-face of Viken has already been discovered, but those people have become the food of monsters."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His subordinates are gentle and handsome young people. After a faint change of expression, they smiled and said: "They are all flashed by the light of the treasure, swallowing wisdom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oliver, you always talk so intentionally Indeed the bard was born. "Hassan patted the boy's shoulder around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three or four months, he found Oliver to speak. Can do things. In addition to the fact that I like to mix with women, it is a rare good man, but then again, choose a man who is a mercenary. Who doesn't like to mix with women? of course. Except for the metamorphosis that favors males. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. Griegera, the captain of the mercenary squad, said coldly: "Don't discuss this kind of thing near the caravan in the future, be careful to be heard by the night watchman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We are only telling stories." Hassan replied angerfully, is this guarding the night guys? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory snorted: "I listened to the aristocrats of the caravan. Since this time, the night watchman is just like crazy, many mercenaries are Because of the willingness to discuss the legend of the magician, it was burned to death as an evil one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" Hassan was shocked, thinking next to him Oliver, who is thinking about his own affairs, is not convinced that the night watchman is mad and not fake, but when are they so crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will know when you try." Griega casually answered the question that Hassan didn't expect the answer, and then looked at Oliver meaningfully. The new member who joined the team for a few months is still alert. He must be hiding something. Maybe it is an important fugitive. If it is not certain that he has nothing to do with the magician, the most basic apprenticeship is not fluctuating. He I have already tied this guy to the referee, and I will be careful to live longer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain suspected me? Oliver narrowed his neck, lowered his mind, and secretly decided to leave the team before the end of the "journey." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the start of Rantart’s escape, he was caught in a dangerous and tense life, although he was only a normal murderer, he had nothing to do with the magician, and he could not enjoy being chased by the night watchman. The treatment, but various mercenaries, adventurers, sheriffs, or several times, he had to fight in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, after his hardships, he is no longer a rookie who doesn’t understand anything. He has learned a lot of combat skills and is smart. The strange powder, which got rid of the danger, fled to the edge of the Holm Kingdom and began to "re-do". He is a small murderer who is not eligible for the treatment of the whole area. When he arrives in a remote place, he naturally Gained security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, he still has not entered the meditation environment described. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not flustered and frustrated, because according to the staff, the talented person needs six months to two years to control Spirit, entering the blank and ethereal state, and I have just tried to meditate for more than four months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the four elements of geothermal feng shui? How do they make up so many things?" As a young man who is interested in drama, Oliver The mind has always diverged, so I walked around thinking about the inexplicable problems that arise after I learned the idea. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the captain Gregory looked around the environment, announced the camp, and arranged Oliver and others to watch the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is worth the summer, but the wind is still cold, so people think that they have entered the late autumn, and they are cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver sat by the fire and looked at the stars in the sky while thinking about his own thoughts: according to the records on the staff, the treasure’s position is nearby! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the obvious rock, the blood-red, like the rock of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fled in this direction all the way, definitely not without purpose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Hassan’s words made him feel like a storm, and he almost thought that he was looking for the half-face entrance of Viking’s “Disaster King”, but his mind was still Be awake, know the gap between legend and reality, and temporarily target the magician who once lived here - the magician who settled here in search of Viken's treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night was getting deeper and deeper, the wind was getting colder, and the other two mercenaries patrolling came back and kicked Oliver’s body: "Get up, "You guys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reached out to the fire and showed a cozy expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver shook his short sword and smiled at his companion: "Do I patrol this side first?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something to fight for..." The mercenary muttered and shook his head and turned to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After patrolling to the secluded place, Oliver’s smile disappeared, clenched the dagger, left the camp directly, and sneaked toward the rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The exchange patrol area is ten minutes, you must enter the place where the treasure is located before..." Oliver's spirit is highly concentrated and there is an unprecedented sobriety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three minutes later, he did not cause the night watchman mercenary to pay attention to the rock, and reached out to rub the gap between the stone and the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute passed, no discovery, another minute passed, still not found, Oliver’s forehead gradually oozes a lot of cold sweat, but the more nervous he is Awake, the action is not stiff and flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his face was happy, his movements accelerated, he dug up a lot of dirt in the cracks, and then pulled out the blue crystal staff. Extend it into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang, the stick seemed to be embedded in something metal, and then the faint blue light came out of the gap, and the nearby The grass is dyed very differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the silent, the wasteland behind the rock cracked a cave with dark gray stone bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took the staff and entered the cave in three steps and two steps, madly running towards the depths, because according to the record of the staff, there is An institution that closes the entrance also needs to be activated, and he must get it all before the mercenary finds it, so that he can pass the security safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the footsteps echoed in the passage, and Oliver saw the round hall in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several stone rooms around the round hall. The doors are wide open, and the inside is clear at a glance. Some are placed with strange plants that are going to be broken, and some are full. A few bookshelves, some piled up dazzling gems, light and shadow, beautiful, dreamlike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
