			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The morning is coming, are you ready? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked through the window of the dimly lit street, listening to Victor, Rhein and Lott to communicate with each other easily this season. landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, why don't you talk? Isn't you interested in the 'Bern' wine brewed by Felice's own home?" Lu Xien, next to the carriage window, asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice's "Bern" manor contains a very nice grape field, and most of the grapes harvested are used for wine making. After many years of hoarding and selection, the “Bern” manor wine has been well-known in Aalto, and it is considered a second-class wine. Only by the invitation of the Feili family dance party and banquet, can you taste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked for an excuse to cover up: "Mr. Rhein, I am actually worried about the ball that will be waiting for a while. I don't know what dance is, I am very embarrassed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need me to teach you? Although you are not a beautiful lady." Rheinland slyly said to Lucien, "Or you treat me as a beautiful lady." OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lucien had nothing to say, Victor told him with a smile: "Your situation, we all know, No one will deliberately ask you to dance. Of course, if Lucien wants to learn, I think the beautiful ladies will be happy to teach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this In a relaxed and casual atmosphere, Lucien's mood gradually calmed down. All the preparations were done, and then it was the specific implementation. Now I am worried and nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage came out of the city gate, crossed the Belém River, and headed for the manor between the northern edge of the Melzer Black Forest and the river,<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the pattern rocky stone field, the home of the Felice family is very rich, the main house is made of pale gold-patterned rock, luxurious and grand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy is wearing a red evening dress, with two rows of maids waiting at the door of the main house, two rows of six copper lamp holders burning bright yellow The flames will drive away the night of seven o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victor teacher, Mr. Rhein, Lucien, Lott, hello." Seeing the carriage stopped, the Philippe Ribbon stewards the stewards and came up because It was her dance party, and her father, Yu Erban and her mother, stayed in the city of Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every noble lady must exercise (read-force) the ability to host a ball, banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are beautiful tonight, Felice." Victor took a look at Felice and smiled with the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flaming evening gown with red long hair, ruby ​​eyes and fair skin, makes Felice much more beautiful than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice thanked her and greeted other guests. She invited more than just classmates and noble friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After greeting the singer with Felice, Lucien, wearing a black formal suit, walked into the main house hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground with the blue-patterned rock is gorgeous and heavy, and the hall has a living room plus a restaurant of five sizes, which can accommodate hundreds of people. get together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long table is placed in the corner of the hall, in addition to a lot of red wine, there are refreshing salads, flesh pies, jelly Waiting for hors d'oeuvres, grilled meat, stewed diced meat, sausages, noodles, fat goose, pheasant, grapes, white bread and other staple foods, fruits, and other weird things that Lucien can't recognize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invited band played a beautiful piece of music on the other corner, making the whole dance look soothing and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien came in, he took a plate at the table and put on barbecue, fat goose, sausage, white bread and salad, while quietly in the corner. Eat, waiting for Felice to announce the beginning of the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you coming to the party instead of the ball, Lucien?" After the dance and the teacher Victor jumped off the opening dance, they searched for Lucien and finally found him in the corner. At this time, the road Sean’s full plate of food has almost been eaten, which makes Felice laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stimulating blood power, Lucien’s appetite increased, and there were still difficult things to wait at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the plate, Lucien spread his hand: "I don't want to dance, Felice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want me to teach you, or Mr. Rhein to teach you, or Yvette?" Felice apparently knew from Victor's mouth that the former Rheinland Tunesan, and Yvette and a The aristocratic man danced happily, perhaps feeling Felice's gaze. She turned her head and looked at it, then smiled and threw a wink at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis turned to sincerely: "Lu Xien, you have to integrate into the upper class, dealing with the nobility, music, dance and hunting are indispensable, Ok, let me teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I prefer to work quietly." Lucien is not willing to behave at a critical juncture, so she has to learn Other men, made a gesture of invitation to Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice reached out with satisfaction: "Are you not doing very well? Don't worry about the ridicule of others, this is always the case for the first time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a hand on Feili's waist and one hand on her shoulder, Lucien listened to her guidance and began the dance practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Felice looked at Lucine with surprise: "Lu Xien, have you ever learned a lap dance? You jumped very well. It’s not like a novice at all, well, except that it’s very cautious and doesn’t dare to be close to my body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My Royal Highness taught me a little.” Lucy The reason why En learned so fast is because of super coordination ability and agility, and this kind of thing can't tell Felice, only Natasha knows to be a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis stunned: "It turns out that Princess Her Royal Highness is a great knight. She teaches you that the effect is definitely good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she suddenly laughed: "His Royal Highness is half a head higher than you, and is a strong five-level. When you dance with you, who is a woman? Lucy. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She obviously heard a bit of rumors, after all, Natasha herself did not hide it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Lucien didn't know what to say, and then he moved, pretending that his foot was slipping and he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice asked with concern: "Is your foot twisted in Lucien? Need a doctor?" There is a special family doctor in the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, just take a break, can you find someone to take me to the room?" Lucien shook his head and said it was not serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis was relieved that he called a male waiter and asked him to take the road to the third floor of the main house. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ............ <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; very clean, very tidy, warm light, soft velvet quilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sat by the bed, watching the male waiter close the door, then took out the stationery and wrote it with a feather pen:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ball of the scene has not been sent yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point it is nearly eight o'clock, the day is completely dark. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> After a full ten minutes before a line of black words on the envelope: "open the window." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly opened the window, in the background of the light music in the hall, a small black ball flew in, directly in the hands of Lucien<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not crush it, but saw a little blurred scene through the black smoke inside the "Ball of the Scene". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
