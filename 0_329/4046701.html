			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is behind the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of Angels" "Mecan Tron" standing on the other end of the immortal martyr also asks himself, the mystery of immortality, the attempts of countless generations What is touched, what will it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II, who is already "Mecan Tron", did not care about his current form. He used his surname to raise his eyes, majestic and restrained, and he said to himself. Dao: "When you know the secret of immortality, you will find the opportunity to kill Lucien Evans and Rhein Karendia. Here, Silver Moon should not come."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of immortality can only be owned by one person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for why not attack the two now, Rudolf II is not stupid, he is very happy to help others to eliminate danger in front, who knows "the door of immortality "What will be hidden afterwards!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is behind the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden Lord, hidden in the "immortal martyrdom", looks at Lucius and Rhein in front, looking at the nearby "King of Angels" ", quietly asked myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of the "Dead World" has always been hidden. Even in the age of mythology, I only realized that there is such a secret world, but I have never found an entrance. It was not until the "Silver Master" Tiffidis discovered this place by chance of similar surnames, but was sealed by the legendary magician such as Maskillin, and he really touched the realm of the dead, when the mysterious world was mysterious. The existence is nearing recovery, revealing the traces of immortality to his subordinates, the Lich King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I also knew the "immortal chamber" and knew some secrets of the truth, the plan of the millennium, the failure again and again, waiting for Now this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the door opens, the mystery of immortality will be revealed in your own eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although born to be a god, but the Lord of Hell believes that himself, Silver Moon, and the abyss should have their own consciousness at the beginning of the mythology, and I have not experienced the birth of the world, the process of the initial life, so it is not clear about the mysteries of creation and creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the premonition of his own level of God tells himself that even if hell is not destroyed, he will not be embarrassed, but one day, hell will decay and will follow The whole world is destroyed, there is no real eternal thing, so after learning the secret of immortality, you will be so keen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the mysterious existence of the Necromancer, the Lord of Hell judges that He should also be aware of the same period of time, but after creating many undead creatures, In order to gain access to the main material world and share the glory of the mythological era, it was discovered that it was "immortal martyrdom" in its "hometown" and fell into it. It took a long time to return, but unfortunately, it was pitted by itself and Yinyue. Putting it into a deep sleep again, I have to say that it is extremely tragic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The secret of immortality, only me, Lord of the Lord, Mardi Moss can master! I have now probably understood the mystery of **, just wait for it to be true Come down, before the reaction of Silver Moon, erase Rhein Karendia, Lucien Evans, and Mecan Tron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp By sacrificing the body of Gono, the Lord of Hell is sure to come true in the non-primary material world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is behind the door? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Lu Xien and Rhein continue to emerge, feeling that the soul is suffocating, why Tanos, Viken, monsters are difficult to disappoint, Will you see it differently? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand is hard, the gray stone slamming the small stone door seems to have the weight of the entire palace, and the power of the road to the West is so great that it pushes a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of this gap, Xiao Shimen suddenly lost weight and slammed open backwards. The scene in the immortal chamber was presented by Lucien et al. In the eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wall in the immortal chamber, no floor tiles, no material, and behind the small stone gate is a vast expanse of starry sky, exudes condescending, super-exclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien first glimpsed, his right hand subconsciously stretched out and passed through the starry sky image without any hindrance. It seemed to be here, but not here, unable to touch, unable to get close, like the soul fireplace, the gods and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems to have a sense of incomprehension with the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The galaxies in the stars are changing like a movie, from far and near, gradually magnifying until a familiar star appears in Lucien’s eyes, and It is more familiar to the blue planet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Lucien's pupil slammed and the strange familiarity emerged wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the earth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the earth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the universe before my crossing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the secret of immortality?" Lucien blurted out with a strong shock and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the secret of immortality?" The rhythm of the Rhine is obviously surprised, disappointed, and difficult to understand. There is a silver moon rising behind him. Sean’s left-handed silver moon breathed out of death and accepted the illumination of the silver moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien’s body, including the breath, is for the strange ghost state, these two groups are no exception, in the moonlight, quickly Growing up to the red-eyed Aitna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the projection is coming..." When I met the monster, Lucien once guessed that Aitna might use the strength of the Rhine to help him. Dealing with monsters, but there has been no movement in this regard, who knows that He is using the rhythm of the Rhine and the breath of his left hand, direct projection, rather than ordinary summoning power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original time left in the left hand to breathe is for later use, whether it is so "black"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitna is still innocent, looking at the starry sky in the immortal chamber, wrinkled with good-looking golden eyebrows, and said, "What about a big meal?" . . . Is this the secret of immortality?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is this the secret of immortality?” The “king of angels” in the “immortal martyrdom” was surprised and disappointed. Controlling himself and asking, the voice echoes in the ear of Lucien et al.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the secret of immortality?" "Lord of Hell" is always ridiculous The smile seemed to solidify on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch the stars, you can jump in space! What is this immortal secret? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not try to control himself, such a "secret of immortality" even let yourself sacrifice Gono this ** can not do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Lord of Hell, He has always been a standard merchant with a focus on interests, and he has never done a loss-making business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s a voice, Lucien wakes up, and behind it is followed by a “big bunch of” enemies, but there is a silver moon here, don’t worry. Life is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning around, looking at the stars again, watching the azure planet familiar with the bones, Lucien frowned and thought for a moment, the expression gradually stretched out: "This is immortal Secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you see?" asked Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really want to be the true God to see the secret of immortality as Tanos said? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien truthfully described: "A vast starry sky, countless sun-like planets, and non-illuminating planets."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the same, this is the secret of immortality?" Rhine laughed and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinyue Aitna regained his gaze, and the scarlet eyes looked at Lucien, no stranger: "I am bothering you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of angels, Rudolph II, is such a secret of immortality. The projections of the silver moon and the Lord of Hell are on the scene, and there is no thought of killing people. One voice: "The secret of immortality is just a scam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
