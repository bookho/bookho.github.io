			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of the light of El, has become a shining ball of light, put into the seventh layer of "Paradise Mountain", blending into the endless Rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha has been shaking her head, feeling helpless, like returning to the state of the little girl when her mother died, years of faith in front of such a scene It tends to collapse, and the result of Lucian’s subtle years of subtle influence is completely inferior to the shock and despair of this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is the most powerful critical weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was speculation that Lucien reluctantly suppressed the crazy cry in his mind, noticed Natasha’s expression, and raised a strange thought in his heart. Is it right to give a gift to Francis, thank him for his outstanding contribution to his happy life, of course, if he can escape with Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, although Lucien could not see his expression, he could imagine how wonderful it was, fearing that it was full of various emotions. Shocked, happy, stunned, fearful, fearful, and so on, all kinds of unspeakable emotions are emerging in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the fusion of El and the "God of Truth", the sacred emblem worn by Lucien suddenly trembled, and there was no source of magical power inside. The rebellious land became the "God of Truth". Until then, Lucien understood why Francis dared to accept the kind of spiritual surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, there is a subjective consciousness in the body of the dead in the body of the dead, will the god of truth be indigested? Will it be stolen by him?" Authority? Will it explode and destroy the world?” Lucien’s mind suddenly flashed an idea, suddenly looking at the paradise hill half-length, long time difficult to close, Francis knows whether El is mysterious Is there a possession? Casually messing up, it will kill people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea just emerged, the endless layer of the seventh layer, the hard-to-see light swelled up, as if to prove Lucian’s guess, which made him unable to express his face. Reluctantly turned into a bitter smile, a little closer to Natasha, and the blasted "God of Truth" killed, it seems to be a kind of "glory", the history of magic should be more such a record: "This is The only magician who once blasphemed God, although he also fell down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, a slight wind rang, and the light sputtered a faint The black and white ash fragments of the pole, the solid monotony of his body seems to be fragmented, fluttering in the distance, and the projection of the paradise mountain gradually becomes illusory and nearly disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I didn't integrate, or else I can try God's Fall!" Francis still looks so crazy and fanatically, it seems right This result is a little regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try God's Fall, with your strength, I am afraid that the body and soul will collapse on the spot, Lucien groaned, but the mood became more and more dignified, Francis I do know that El is hiding the mysterious existence of the mysterious existence of the dead spirit. He is more mysterious than he imagined. Can he have a good effect in the presence of Heaven Mountain projection? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha pointed at Francis and shouted: "No matter how you modify it, you can't hide the essence of you. Your sentence is awkward!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis slowly draws a cross on the chest that is short and long, left and right: "My piety to the Lord is no worse than you, but our view of the Lord, no matter what." Whether it is a theological or a popular one, there are great differences, but this cannot be used as evidence that I am a heresy. We only have a new understanding of the existence and form of the Lord on the guidance of a great prophet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Prophet..." Lucien repeats a questioningly, sounding like the head of this heretical organization lurking inside the northern church, a church in the north Saint? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the controversy between Francis and Natasha, Lucien is happy to see it. Delaying time is very helpful for regaining his mental strength, even if it can only be used. Under the high level of magic, with his own assistance, Natasha, who is seriously injured, is not unable to fight with Francis, who only has eight levels. What needs to be worried is the half-god lich who just walked the chaotic legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the piece of black and white ash that tried to escape stopped in the air, and a golden skull flashed in front of him, Congers expected than everyone else. The transmission distance is close, even came over in advance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-point needle-shaped red awning wind madly jumps like a flame, gradually turning into a gray color, the space around it is distorted, and the breath is rising rapidly. In a short moment, the half-god lich seems to break through the embarrassment of the past few hundred years, directly Raised a level, and it seems that he controls the mysterious existence of the dead, not the other way around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounced gray flames look at Lucien, Natasha, Francis, and the paradise mountain projections that are about to disappear, sullen and cold: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all going to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the magic tower opposite the sea, the storm dominated the information in front of him, his eyes sparkled, and the hurricane around him rose, and everything in the whole house was rolled up, except by Hathaway and Douglas sitting on the back chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congas..." Fernando snarled in a low voice, then jerked up and said to Douglas: "Let Begner cooperate with me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bergner is the name of the tower prophet, and he also entered this alien space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Douglas Cihe also showed a dignified expression: "Good. You and Hathaway rushed to save the road, I am responsible for watching Weisen. Special, don't let him play tricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has always been a temper, after the approval of Douglas, directly to the place where "the door of the outside world" Flying, Hathaway remained silent and followed his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "gate of the outer gate" is in the lobby, the prophet Begner, who was informed by Douglas, has been waiting there, the gray pointed hat is like a star tower The epitome of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded to the prophet, Fernando first entered the door of the alien and returned to Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hathaway and Bergner also appeared in the Magic Tower of the Parliamentary Headquarters, Fernando walked out while performing a spiritual connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you want to arrange a door to the outside of the mountains of the northern Eldodo?" Bergner wondered that Hathaway also followed Fernando. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sounds close to roaring: "Repositioning, re-establishing, takes a day, but from here to Heidel City, we only need tens of seconds, and Both Vicente and Congos are not there. In an hour, we can control the pale hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begner, predicting the Conggers The position of the fate, and the position of the door he used." Hathaway directly requested the local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begner is somewhat awkward: "Do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead, just What problems have been solved.” Fernando’s red eyes are a horrible and repressed storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demigod lord, congratulations on using the mystery of the dead world The main body fragment of existence rises to the second level of the legendary field. In the future, it is expected to be promoted to the field of the gods, to control the soul community, and to take charge of the death." Francis faced the threat of the legendary strongman, but smiled and talked unhurriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers stunned: "I know you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He won't think Surrender? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the experience of being beaten by Lucien in the past three times, Congos is no longer ready to swear, dead talent is the safest target! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis is slightly stunned, drawing the strange cross on his chest, short and short, long and left, his tone respects the earth: "The great prophet will lend my body. I hope that you can live alive and enjoy the beautiful future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers suddenly raised a bad feeling, the golden skull opened, dark and difficult The sound of the sound: "The soul is forbidden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent roar of the sound, the remnant of the paradise of the head of Francis’s head exploded with a holy light, trying to imprison the soul The countless illusions are all blocked, and at the same time cause the feeling of time and space to be distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
