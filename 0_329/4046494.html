			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the priests on the semi-high platform, or the followers who listened to the "theological debates", they suddenly felt that their heads were not enough, what a small world The world, the big world, the vast land, the number of sands in the Solna River, it’s unheard of, never seen, even if you have never imagined it, but such a world structure, such a huge number makes people feel grand and The hair is set off by the "resurrection, fertility and redemption god" El Supreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxis hiding in the corner looked at Lucien and Francis, muttering: "Is this great El? I, how do I I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis looked at Lucien with a smile and admiration, and he couldn’t help but laugh and hurt. Don't whisper your thumb, talent is really talent! Even if you can't be a real "disciple" in the future, and you don't understand musical instruments, the bard who is a rumor about storytelling will not bury the "prominent ability" in this respect, and will inevitably become an epic figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of Nob looked at the funny and ridiculous Lucien, a kind of imagination was crushed, bragging all the feelings of others, angry and angry The body is shaking, it seems that the brain will fall down at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although according to Lucian’s thoughts, it is possible to compile a small and infinite land, a land of infinite quantity, a vast and infinite place, and the god of the moon to the god of Els Above, there is no pressure at this time of "blowing" until next year, but even if the following uneducated believers can see that this is purely plagiarized by the "resurrection god", except for a small part of the death loyal willingness I believe that most people will think that Luna has no way. They can only rely on the other person's words to find a sense of existence. There is no doubt that they will lose the debate and even give people the impression that they are deceiving from beginning to end. The only hope after being expelled from the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar ideas have appeared in the hearts of the priests of the underworld, the god of thunder and lightning, the sun and the god of justice. They are frowning one by one, bitterly Zhang face, trying to find a concept above Liviathan's world view, but they all belong to the primitive religion, even the simple philosophy has not yet developed, the imagination is limited by itself and the times, what to continue to "brow"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the Mother Earth, the God of Wisdom, the God of Rain and the God of Love, who had lost the theological debate before, looked at the distorted gloating expression The rest of the priests were to be driven out of the valley, and they were expelled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said leisurely: "My Lord opened up infinite land, maintained the land of infiniteness, destroyed the land of infiniteness, and created from destruction." The new land of infiniteness, the function of creation, maintenance, and destruction, is for the sake of circulation and for the resurrection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can really exaggerate...Nobu, etc. The priest racked his brains but could not think of anything, only secretly groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Lord has created a new paradise that will never die and last forever in this infinitely recurring and revolving land. This is me. I just said that the brothers and sisters who truly believe in the Lord and sincere repentance are redeemed and enjoy the eternal happiness. My lord calls it..." Lucien wanted to use Heaven Mountain directly, but this is easy to see by Francis. Properly, then forced to change the mouth, "polar paradise, extreme music, or bliss pure land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following believers continue to make inspiratory sounds, exclamations, no I think that El God is so great that I will redeem myself and others, but this is consistent with Lucien’s previous description, echoing back and forth, making people faintly willing to believe that it seems that the paradise really exists, it seems that the devout faith is great. The "Resurrection, Fertility, and Redemption God" can really get rid of this painful and degenerate world after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the god of salvation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob and other priests were taken away, their faces were pale, and they wanted to refute and could not find a breakthrough. Nina also narrowed her eyes and thought like a deep thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Nob got up from the silver chair and took a step forward and asked aloud: "Leviathan, I ask you, in your so-called god Before the creation of the world, what was the original state of the infinite land? What state was the original paradise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not expect him to ask this The key question, a slight glimpse, immediately wakes up, because the back of Nina's lips is slightly creeping, others may not see it, but Lu Xien who can have the strength of the Cavaliers will not find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is nothingness, it is chaos, it is the origin of space and time." Lucien deliberately revealed flaws, too much performance would cause Francis to doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobuhaha smiled: "Then I ask you, where does nothing come from, where does chaos come from, nothing but nothing but chaos?" What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a sentence in his heart, it is a great moon god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers are also puzzled, yes, nothing comes, nothing before nothing, nothing outside nothingness, is it a greater existence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis had a slight radiance after hearing this question, and seemed to finally find his own rhythm. After he used his eyes to signal Lucian, he stood up and said: Beyond nothingness and chaos is not descriptive, that is, my Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unable to describe? What is that?" Nob and other priests laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis is very serious: "No matter whether nothingness, chaos, or time and space origin, it is a definition of human beings. The concept of human beings is within the imagination of human beings. But the existence of my Lord transcends all definitions, all meanings, all causes and effects, all concepts, all matter, all spirits, all languages, so they cannot be described and cannot be described."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;啊? This is more horrifying and incomprehensible than the world view of Leviathan. No matter the priests such as Nob, or Nina in the back, they are a dull appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis smiled: "I am from the kingdom of the eastern desert, where a famous wise man, Lucien Evans, has had a deep Explain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise of the wise? Evans... Lucien almost squirted out, but fortunately forcibly held back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina, Nob and other priests and believers suddenly thought that the greatness of the El God has enveloped the East? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that our observation of things is limited by our physical and spiritual conditions, and we can only get one-sided understanding, such as the light in front of us is actually Colorful, but we can't see anything. We can only find the original appearance of light through the help of water or bubbles. Therefore, our understanding is human and mortal. We define it, our logic, Our imagination is mortal, and the definition, meaning, and logic of mortals certainly cannot describe the true great existence, that is, my Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, I said that my Lord transcends all definitions, all meanings, all causes and effects, all concepts, all matter, all spirits, all languages, whether nothing or nothingness, is not the true, imaginable appearance that you can understand. Forcing the definition of God with the definition of mortal is 亵渎.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is that Nina, Nob and other priests seem to have been cleaned up. Originally from Previous knowledge of God is so shallow, is depicting the overriding presence of a mortal mind can often Vision, silver chaos, enjoyment of their own gods, as if in addition to power, does not meet the definition of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also stood up and smiled softly: "My Lord is both a existent and a non-existent. It is neither nothing nor nothing. It cannot be used as a surname. Concepts such as differences, shapes, time and space, limitations, subjectivity, causality, etc., he transcends them in essence, does not require faith, and does not require worship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we humans need faith and need redemption, so our understanding of the true master is expressed in the 'lower concept' as a great 'resurrection, abundance and redemption god'. He is the embodiment of the true Lord, He We are two in one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We only need to worship and believe in the 'resurrection, abundance and the god of redemption', and we can be redeemed with pious remorse. We The true Lord cannot be understood and described. The true Lord does not need our understanding and description. We cannot influence the true Lord. The true Lord will not attempt to influence the world."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis agrees to behead, Leviathan is able to root Himself in front of the simple expression construct "true Lord and the Lord in the material world and the spiritual incarnation" Both philosophically this one, theology is really outstanding talent, but still too complex and not easy to preach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, will he be otherwise weird?" Francis looked slightly in a flickering way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
