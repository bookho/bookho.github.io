			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lich King" and "Ghost Lord" hiding near the soul fireplace closely monitor the "world of the door" and are ready to attack the serious injuries that escaped inside. By. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, they saw the "death servant" turned into a cloud of smoke, wrapped in a dragon lich flying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the killing successful?" "The Lich King" is highlighted from the void, although I know that the servant of death can not kill Douglas and others, but still can not help Ask this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death servant" put down the "Dragon Lich" that was hit hard by the Rhine. The smog condensed two red needles, and the tone was plain and plain: "No success." But can't stay any longer, otherwise it will be killed by the monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s secretly gnashing his teeth, once thought it was to chase others, the result is Inside, I found that every one is fierce to the extreme. Even the two young "gentles" who look very weak can kill themselves by equipment. If they don't see the machine fast, I am afraid that they have completely fallen into the inside, not being reversed. The pursuit of killing depends on the "Lord". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have done our duty, the Lord will not blame us." "Lich King" Bai Sensen's teeth open and close, comforting the "death servant" ", also comfort yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being wrapped up in two forces that could not coexist, Lucy I only felt that my soul, body, spirit, clothes, rings, badges, pocket watches, all fell into a wonderful state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of high-altitude that once fell on the heights of Aitna’s embarrassment, letting Lucien carry out an unimaginable transformation in this respect, as if he himself The material world, separated from the spiritual world, looks at itself from a very high perspective in a state of coexistence between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unspeakable scene, because your soul is in the magical array, the body is in the magical array, the mental power is in the magical array, and the consciousness is in the magical array. Inside, it is impossible to see itself from the outside world, but this feeling is such a real thing. When the feedback world gets feedback, the vast starry sky is very similar to the feeling of watching yourself. The only difference is this time. His own perspective shifted to the condescending "person" in the vast starry sky, watching him indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strange and unimaginable changes in their souls and flesh, sometimes like clouds in the air, everywhere, and sometimes concentrated into substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Amazingly looking at his own Lucien vaguely grasped what it is, what is the true power of this magical array, and the soul fireplace What is the relationship... I am afraid this is not clear to the sun king "Tanos" who arranged this magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of transformation is in contrast to the feeling of silver moon coming. It can be found that the two sides are very different in a certain degree of similarity, and they are still missing some key things. , so it’s just a kind of god? So, Aitna can’t have a way to pass the immortal martyrdom?” In this world, no one has more experience than Lucien in this area, and there is a theoretical conjecture to let him go and verify. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repeated use, the pattern of the magic array is faintly cracked. It seems that once or twice it will be completely broken. To re-arrange, only the original owner Sun King "Tanos" can be done, others must spend a long time cracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the body and the soul seem to have merged together, creating a great suction, watching the "Lake" in the "high altitude" indifferently Pull it down and drill into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The super-external perspective was suddenly lost. Lucien’s mind was revived after a brief chaos, and his eyes opened, just in contact with the eyes of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you are already 'dead'." The monster's sulky face showed a smile on his face. "Actually, I have been worried that you can't be this magical array." Transforming, because there are so many things in your soul and memory that I can't sense things that I can't explore in depth, and there seems to be a mystery hidden in your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is another thing." Lucien smiled and stood up and found that he was a strange ghost state, ready to be dispersed, ready to be aggregated, the strength still kept the legendary first-order, and the items were still on his body. There is also an intact "replacement puppet". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the gods be so easy? The reason why I am a god is because I am two sides with Viking. It is a different form of the same kind of god. It is also a hidden danger brought by this road. The same is true for Tanos. Adventure wants to promote the true God, and Heaven Mountain is just a fusion of the power of the world and the power of faith. There is no layer of power. Until it is integrated into the subject consciousness of Tanos, it has a certain true surname." The monster did not say too much. In detail, it seems that in the face of "dead people," He is also subject to restrictions that cannot reveal the secrets of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not ask, afraid of triggering restrictions, was killed by the monster, but probably can guess the situation at the time, Viken should have been before entering the spirit world The strength of the legendary peak is exploring the path of becoming a god-like, and the things left in the Tanos laboratory gave him a complete method. Later, when refining the monster, he separated some souls and integrated them with virtual personality. The monster, turn it into its own avatar, while letting the monster deal with Maskillin and others, while taking advantage of this opportunity to use the Sun King relics to attack the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, there should be something wrong, the monster has some self-awareness, and Viken also used this to get rid of other hidden dangers, leaving only this One problem is to become a more perfect kind of god than Bitanos. Otherwise, it cannot explain why Tanos has a big problem at any time, but Viken can develop with the god of truth for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know that Viken is going further than Tanos in his own research, so he took the opportunity to separate the 'monsters' in advance to eliminate most of the hidden dangers. Or is it an accidental coincidence?" For this old monster, Lucien is more inclined to the former speculation. He should have never thought that after he was promoted to a god, the monster became a god, and the dream of reintegration was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster may have been smashed for too long, some things can’t be said, some things can be stunned: “To become a god of this road, first You have to have an unusually heterogeneous space or a post-door world, and then you have to have a huge amount of faith, then you have to find a way to fuse them together, and finally you can rely on the power of the previous condensed emotions and both. Conversion, the failure rate is very high, the hidden danger is very large, the power may be more than the natural god, but it is actually a little worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but we are all I can use 'God Drop', and Mardi Moss and Etna have been squatting a few times, but they dare not come in. Only the abyss that has no brain can break in directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression is condensed, can he also use “God Drop”? From the point where Thrard can rely on the mysterious fragments to use the "God Drop", this is not impossible, so whispered: "Mr. Monster, you and Wicken are not easy to use 'God Drop' should not be worried. Will cause self-depravity, but care for each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of a god is in some sense not dead, what is the soul and body being countered? So Lucien guessed that the more ‘God Drops’ are used, the weaker the soul is, and the easier it is to be swallowed up by “self”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case, then Viken, the Pope, is more horrible than he imagined. In the case of Platinum Scepter, the strength may be stable. The first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster smiled, did not answer, did not know whether he was scrupulous, or was restricted: "So, it is best not to promote this kind of god by this method You don't want to fight yourself all day long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I have my own direction, it won't be wrong to go this one. The road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his decision so wrong, his own research has not yet reached this point, just by the words of Silver Moon Aitna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien combines his knowledge of the Arcane, the information of the Soul Library, the feelings of the past, and the vague feeling that both Tanos and Viking will Help is the key, ignoring the key place to truly become a god, just as the Lord of Hell ridiculed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look very confident, then I don't project it in your body, help you use 'God Drop', this will make your soul be I am infested, well, this state transition can last for ten minutes, and when you get back, it is not a broken creature, I will not kill you again, but you should not touch other things, otherwise it is easy to let the restrictions It’s time to play, and you’re in trouble.” The monster groaned. For him, Lucien knew Vikken’s secret and lived out to be successful. He was not Sarder. He had a magical parliament behind him, and he was also a future. Bright arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not find Douglas and others because they were too strong, easy to produce greed, and they were very confident about the human heart and monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
