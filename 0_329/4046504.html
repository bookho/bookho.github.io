			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver moon sprinkled on the river bank, clear and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Francis’s proposal, Ramiro groaned and then deliberately showed a greedy look: “The treasure of the underworld? Can I go together?” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Husum city, when he heard that the underworld dominated the real fall, Ramiro was shocked. It was a nine-ring ban, not a death. May kill the underworld master directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the devil’s count was sealed by the shackles for a whole thousand years without dying, and later passed through many generations before the magical effect of the shackles slowly disappeared. The devil's efforts to get rid of the difficulties, so he seriously doubts that the nine-ring Master is arrogant, the situation is chaotic, the magical array is arranged, the underworld is dominated, and the spike is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was interested in investigating this matter but was prevented from knowing the specific position where the underworld dominated the seal, and did not know where his gods were, plus the discovery of Anthony With the clue to trace the incident of the god of the moon, I temporarily put it down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after knowing from the mouth of Francis that Leviathan discovered the divine domain dominated by the underworld, he desperately wanted to explore one or two and see if the underworld master had ever discovered it. What, what happened, this was targeted by the Nine Rings Archmage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fall of the dominance of the underworld, Ramiro’s only suspicion of "Leviathan" disappeared completely - he saw Leviathan Jumping into the water, and one of the places where the shackles can be cast is probably in the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the two agreed locations, their location with Husum City, and the compactness of several time points, it is clear that Leviathan is not enough Time to go back and forth, but also to survive Francis, even if he is a nine-ring Master, can not do it, unless it is a legendary strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in that case, it is entirely possible to swept the Eldo Peninsula. There is no need to hide and hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The treasure of a false god must be very rich, I don't mind giving you a friendship in exchange for An Hughes." Francis smiled, his main The purpose is also to investigate the fact that the underworld dominates the imprisonment. "And one more person has more strength, so that we can finish the search in the fastest time without disturbing the Lord of War."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When he said this, he still smiled and looked at Lucien casually: "Leviathan, you don't want to go? You were very yearning before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If it is mine, I am sure I will not go. Who knows what monsters are in the gods dominated by the underworld, but now with Francis and Ampers, I certainly don't want to let go of those 'cute' treasures." Lucien said with a "fanatic", the inexplicable gaze of passing through the gods and the idea that the underworld masters suddenly moved the gods to the bottom of the Solna River and explored the investigation. Now it is just that Francis is a shield, and even if they check Less than anything, can still be dominated by the underworld Curry find the right material body repair magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiro suddenly frowned: "Then we should as soon as possible, after the fall of the underworld, his gods will slowly collapse, and then find something later. It’s not enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the underworld to dominate the Divine and look for the “treasure” separately, you have a better chance to kill Leviathan and pretend to be him. By then, pushing things out of the quirks of the gods is much better than other excuses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leviathan, lead the way." Francis said without hesitation, the underworld rule is only imprisoned, and there is an incarnation, how can the Divine domain dissipate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Francis are the same mind, but they have not shown it. After all, in the eyes of the devout Elshen believers, the underworld master is sure to be sure to be killed by him. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stone bracelet, Lucien first jumped into the Solna River, Francis followed, and Ramiro changed his blood. , simulating a kind of underwater breathing and action-like magicalism, silently following in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After swimming for a while, after blocking the less rigorous watergate, Lucien took Francis and Ramiro to the gods dominated by the underworld. That strange gaze was once again flashing away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing through a cluster of strange gray water plants, Francis suddenly slammed into a seemingly ordinary river stone, and then the river changed rapidly, becoming a dark and heavy stone door with a strong death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stone door is quite broken, the dark color is peeled off a little, and the material inside is slowly decaying into mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The master of the underworld is really fallen!" Francis casually smiles like a smile, blurted out, isn't it a ban? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian and Ramiro looked at him strangely: "When did you have the illusion that the underworld dominated without degeneration?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two seem to have the same expression, but Ramiro has a mockery, but Lucien is clenched with both hands, and his strength seems to be puncturing his palm, because it is not so hard to Control yourself as horrified as Francis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the shackles to seal the underworld dominates Lucian, no one knows the specific situation better than him, but the underworld masters are really degraded! Things are getting more amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it was affected by the strong death atmosphere here." Francis converges and surprises, and he answers home. He has never been in Leviathan, Anthony, etc. In front of him, he concealed his uniqueness and strength, and he did not worry about suspicion. Strength is the root of everything, and he has "absorbed" the name of the spiritual family. El is very reassured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro didn’t say much, turned his eyes to the Dark Stone Gate and studied how to open it. Anyway, if he had the chance, he wouldn’t mind getting Francis together. But it is a great credit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the doctrines of the underworld and the myths that have been circulated, there are seven gates outside His Temple, and each door must be exchanged with a funeral to open. Otherwise, it will always suffer between the two doors, until the soul completely disappears and merges with nature.” Francis simply said, “Now because the gods are broken, the underworld guards return to sleep, the door begins to decay, we just need to just You can open it with something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he picked up a cobblestone and gently placed it in the huge keyhole on the stone door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, there was a brilliance of brilliance on the dark stone door, which opened silently and silently, and there was painful mourning in it, blowing the cold and chilly wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis didn’t delay, when he first entered, Lucien stepped behind him, and the two entered the darkness of the darkness of the fingers for a minute before waiting for the pull. Miro came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have performed several kinds of magical techniques outside to prevent being attacked by death forces." Ramiro preemptively explained, his godland dominated by the underworld. Be full of vigilance, who knows if the Nine-Circle Archmage has left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis did not say anything, gently sighed, and walked to the next door on the only green phosphorescent road that could be seen in the darkness, suddenly, There were a pale and distorted faces around them. They were male and female, old and young, floating in the air, and they rushed toward the three with painful and painful emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark fog emerged from Francis and shrouded the surroundings. These "soul faces" disappeared silently as soon as they came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meditation is broken, the dead spirits are beginning to be unconstrained." Francis reminded him, then took out a silver coin and opened the next stone door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the three met the undead creatures such as demons, ghosts, low-level mummies, but there are Francis, the knight who has shown great strength, and the customs are very Smooth, occasionally missing the net, was also killed by the "fourth-level Knight" Leviathan and the "fourth-level priest" Anxius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth stone door opens, the door is no longer dark, but it is like a fog in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, there are many people falling to the ground, the breath is weak, it seems to be starving to death; there are many altars, many people who are afraid of crying are numb On the altar; there are beast monsters stalking, screaming and biting and swallowing humans; there are priests, gods fighting, ordinary people who are inexplicably affected by death; there are gods anger, picking up floods and flooding the scenes of the city; there are frequent wars, bones everywhere Scenes; hardships, repeated whipping, even going to fight with wild beasts to please the aristocratic slaves...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
