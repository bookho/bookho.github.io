			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the legendary powerhouses such as Stanislas, the Lord of the Eyes, and the "Six-armed Judge" did not feel desperate, since the high-end combat power is the same, only the number is poor. In the second half, there is not even a chance to escape. In particular, the "King of the Nightmare" is a legendary magician with a variety of means of life-saving. After all, everyone is in the same order, and it is absolutely inferior to be an enemy. It is impossible to die quickly, and if it is not quickly ruined, there is an opportunity to use its own life-saving ability to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is far from the depth of the battle for the dark world powerhouses, and they are far from the level of despair and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "dream of the mist" of "The King of Nightmare", their thinking quickly exchanged similar views with their extraordinary ability, intending to concentrate on breaking through the encirclement. At this time, their emotions are also mixed with the "hate" of Lucian and the resentment of this, the damn "disaster demon", "the incarnation of the god of doom", which brought death and disaster, but Fortunately, there is him, otherwise the two legendary peaks of Danisos and Dracula join the battle group, and there will never be more than one legend that can survive and escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Staniss’s thoughts of abandoning the eyes of the demon Lord, the Void Demon, etc., alone, he has blessed a legend similar to “reunion”. The spell, as long as it fires, can return to its own "nightmare world", but he finally chose to stay temporarily, whether it is "the king of the dark side" Ogg, or "Ice Queen" Fitia, are familiar with the legendary magic The men who escaped their skills, they could not prevent this, and they might not be able to escape, but they might fall into a desperate situation. Find a better chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he used the "dream fog" to influence Taigulong, the blood king, etc., and turned into a real "night of dreams", shuttled in their thinking waves. Create illusions and "unreal scenes" that reflect reality, while secretly prophetic spells. Determining how to escape is the safest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he is also concerned about the situation of Lucien, although Lucien is in the "time and shining dragon" Danisco's time cone Under the sneak attack of time and space, Dracula seems to be overwhelmed, but Stanis believes that he has repeatedly created miracles and weakened him. It is impossible to be vigilant and alert to unexpected situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the black clouds that are constantly slamming under the red lightning are falling down at the height of this magic tower. Then the pale white mist was dyed with a layer of darkness, which caused the chaotic "dream" to lose some of its psychological mapping, and the chaos was even more illogical, a good-looking novel:! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Miles and other six Taikoo dragons also gave up the human form, and they showed their original shape, which can give them 100% strength!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hundred meters of red dragons rise around the flames. The horrible heat is spreading. In the blazing flame, the ruby-like scales are fierce; the ice-cone-like breath with a deep cold and deep paralysis spits out from a beautiful dragon mouth, which makes the dream fog condense into ice and block it. The whirlwind blade of the "six-armed judge"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of Taikoo dragon unfolds his body, the shortest is also nearly 100 meters, the magic tower of Natravos Although the first floor is very tall and wide, it does not accommodate these giants, but things are beyond the expectations of the legendary strongman such as the Werewolf Prince Sonic. The ruined top-level magic tower seems to be connected with the surrounding "Devil's Jungle". It became a piece, deep and wide. I couldn't see the end of the space. Even though the seven Taikoo dragons twirled with impunity, they didn't seem to be cramped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" This kind of abnormality made Stamnis and other powerful people who knew the legendary magician's knowledge smell a little wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To play the superimposed effect of the magic tower and the half-plane, either the magic tower itself is not damaged seriously, under the control of Taling, or the magic tower is close Destruction, but still retains some effects, actively calling the power of the semi-planet under the control of the master, but now, the towering spirit of this magic tower is obviously degraded in the storm of destruction, who is manipulating? Who is calling the power of the "Devil's Jungle"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the "abortic lord" Natravos not fall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also an ally of Danisos and Dracula? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Nattraworth’s life and death can be concealed to make the legendary peak Lucian Evans unable to get a definitive conclusion, but absolutely no way His astrological falsification results, so the "Abyss Lord" has definitely fallen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were in a state of suspicion, and a smirk came out of the dark clouds outside the window: "I am still waiting for someone to escape with a transmission spell. The biggest ability of the chaotic 'Devil's Jungle' is to confuse the effects of the transmission spells." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds are scattered, and under the lightning of the blood, a handsome man with long hair and dark skin is coming, he is wearing a black tuxedo and elegant. And chic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gornheim!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different names are determining the identity of the coming, the new devil prince, Gonheim! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary powerhouses such as Stanislas, Sony and the Lord of the Eyes suddenly have a clear understanding, this time the terror conspiracy that grasps the mind is absolutely the devil The prince is the leader! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like the devil of the devil in hell, known for his deceit and conspiracy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how can he easily come to the main material world? How can you control the half-face of the "Abyss Lord" Natravos? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they knew their doubts, they also seemed to create desperate emotions. "The Dark Lord" Gonheim smiled: "Actually, you can now call it." I'm the lord of the abyss, Natravos, he has become a part of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about his body, his body is illusory, it seems to exist Many people's hearts, and his face is also ugly by the beauty, three white eyes, high cheekbones, collapsed nose, convex lips, suddenly "Netravos"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing the "King of the Nightmare", the king of the nightmare, sinks into the heart, and the "Dark Lord" takes the "Abyss Lord" Natravos as a container. The state has changed, and by using his half plane and body, you can steadily descend to the main material world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Staniss’s darkness fell into the darkness is not only this, but also the fact that there is suddenly a legendary enemy at the scene, which was not desperate. The situation immediately fell to the abyss, and the legendary peak in the battle of its own plane, the strength is close to the gods - even if this is only the legendary second-order "demon jungle", it can make the "dark master" play a percent One hundred and thirty strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a news of death for himself. It is impossible for him to stop the "Dark Lord" attack. Fighting to escape, good-looking novels:! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the demon Lord, the Werewolf Prince, the Dark Knight, regardless of knowing the mystery of state transition, are secretly concealed: "damn Natravo S, nothing to play with painful self-abuse! Let’s play with yourself now? But don’t drag us when you die!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it’s time-consuming The impact, the change is slightly behind the other side, and new situations have emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "night dominates" Dracula's right hand with white gloves passes through the "time and space" of solidification, such as the cage, it is stable, accurate and fast. Lucien chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole layer of defense of Lucien’s body was disintegrated under the dragon magic spell of Danishos before, and was unable to block Dracula’s attack. His reaction seems to be slower, and Dracula is directly caught! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the humiliation that caused me, I want to come back ten times and hundreds of times today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of De Gula’s heart has just risen, and the right hand wrapped in a layer of black shadow has an empty feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula's deep red pupil suddenly shrank, and saw that the whole person of Lu Xien became illusory, seemingly permeated in the air, without any substance, so he This blow without special exceptional ability is completely lost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He completed the state conversion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not looking down on the ancient devil state transition method ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
