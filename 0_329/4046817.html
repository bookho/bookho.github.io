			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Grand Bright Hall is immersed in an unspeakable silence and silence, and the quiet atmosphere is like a solidification, whether or not it participates in this action of capturing the artificial planet, all cardinals The members of the regiment have lowered their noble heads and are ready to meet the anger of His Majesty the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action is too frustrating. It has been doomed from the beginning, making the adventure of His Majesty the Pope meaningless, and certainly someone has to take responsibility for it. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the legendary magicians of the Magic Council, the Church’s Holy Spirit priests and holy knights are less detached, and their own status and authority will limit them. The extent of strength growth, the higher the status, the greater the right to master, the closer to the Lord, the faster the strength is upgraded, and the dependence on the essential surname, so the punishment is not a symbol of insignificance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, before they did not master the mystery of the faith, the previous popes also had the "death penalty", the "God-given means", the used Holy Spirit pastor will be cut off The connection with Heaven Mountain can only use its own "belief heart" and can't be supplemented. It will soon become a legend with no layer and no power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the status of the legendary magicians is entirely from their own strength, even if they lose the identity of the members of the highest panel, they will not affect anything, they are against the Magic Council. The reliance lies in the environment of resource integration, arcane and magical research, so it must be a lot of detachment, and it will not hurt if it is punished. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why the internal factions of the parliament are numerous and the internal contradictions cannot be eliminated. The legendary people have advantages and disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most embarrassing member of the Cardinal Mission is Philip. This plan was completed by him. Benedict III gave him the biggest **, even himself. Became a part of his plan, but he messed things up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce sound of the artificial planet's self-explosion is like the magical parliament's ridiculous and malicious laughter, always echoing in the heart of Philip, so that he can not be relieved for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he is a new pastor of the Holy Spirit, has the potential and hope to become a "young man" of the saints, the hard-core pope has to consider how to assume the pope Throw your anger and think about how to avoid "loss" to the greatest extent possible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although after Pope Wicken’s use of believers’ emotional state and how to use the power of faith to unite and stabilize the “people’s heart” within the church, They have all had initial gains, they can steal the power of faith on their own, their strength has grown substantially, and they are no longer afraid of “exceptional punishment”, but it also means that their dependence on the church organization has increased! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many times they are happy than the strong ones who need to sneak through the painstaking efforts to collect emotions and spread their beliefs, Every day, you can steal the power of faith from the parish that you control. You don't have to do more things. If you are punished, you will be transferred to a remote parish. It will be a very serious loss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Benedict III wears a sacred crown on his head, holding a platinum scepter in his hand, and his eyes staring indifferently at the Cardinal members for five minutes. Did not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His kind of god power is not distributed, but the invisible pressure makes the whole hall as quiet, so that every cardinal member does not dare to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he sighed softly: "This time has nothing to do with you, not your fault, the plan is actually close to perfection, the success will be the Arcanist Turned away and held up, the blame blame magicians are too embarrassed, actually placed on the artificial planet this strange self-explosive device."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His peaceful tone and the destiny of the event allowed the atmosphere of solidification to melt away, and Philip’s heart sighed with relief and expressed sincere gratitude. The Pope’s majesty was broad-minded and far-sighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Majesty, what do we do now? Plan a similar action again?" 腓力 deliberately asked himself to know the answer to the question, so as to transfer arguments The focus is no longer entangled in past failures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing III seems to be unaware of his careful thoughts, his voice is not high and not low: "Before you understand the surprise of the blasting device, all similar plans are There is no possibility of success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
