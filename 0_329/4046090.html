			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a tall black fir near the Ranger’s cabin, and it’s densely dark green and dark in the canopy. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the message was placed in the "Larnaca Canyon", Lucien came here, quietly and cautiously waiting for the collision between the church and the Silver Point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien’s own strength, he did not dare to approach the forester’s cabin, fearing that it would be discovered directly by the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien wore a black robe and a hood to cover the entire face in the darkness, with a layer of frosty moonlight on his hands. On the branches, let the body sway with the leaves, and the eyes in the shadow of the hood focus on the direction of the forester's hut. When the light signal rushes into the air, but is swallowed by the ripples, Lucien slightly calculates the angle. Then I figured out the real hiding place of the "Silver White Horn". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The look of the forester's cabin is ninety meters northwest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light being Interception, the Black Forest, one kilometer away, began to illuminate all kinds of light from time to time, with pure light, hot flames, black shadows, and cold white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien maintains the calmness of the caster and looks at these "fireworks" without expression. When they are more and more concentrated, they nod their heads. : "Beginning to gather, the four weeks left me the space to sneak in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While judging, Lucien looked at the other direction: "This kind of movement She should have already discovered it. After all, the distance is not too far, and there is no mountain cover in the middle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............" The Holy Scriptures kept turning, "flame strikes", "killing techniques", "severe injuries", "five-level angel summoning" and so on, almost razing the Black Forest within a radius of 500 meters, several dark knights Without any resistance, he died under his magical powers, and all the arrays of investigations, traps, etc. arranged in this range were also destroyed, so that the high priests in the "underground palace" could no longer control the situation nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-level bishop, close to the high-ranking caster, fully demonstrates the destructive power of his own horror, and even more frightening is that in the "Holy Code" In the flipping, the direct application of the singer, often a holy light, a night watchman who was still in a state of serious injury immediately resumed as before, killing his own enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pastor who masters the healing theology is the gospel of all companions, and the nightmare of all opponents. After all, when he finally kills the enemy, he suddenly Get rid of the injury, restore the full combat power in the state full of blood, then no matter who it is, it will definitely be more and more guilty, and there are six of the 18 left watchmen who are pastors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So more than 20 dark knights and strange creatures can kill nearly ten vigils by sneak attack and assassination, and wait until the other party reacts. After starting to gather, they can only kill three, and their losses are two or three times in the other party, and they are quickly reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, a darkness shrouded over, and there was a squeaky squeaking sound, like a tiny bug that was hidden. These are really bugs, and they are like a black cloud-like black insect swarm In it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several pastors want to continue to perform the magic, but the whole body is itchy, unable to maintain the concentration of spells, and suddenly the magic fails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their Shield of Light was actually bitten by these worms, and a black, tiny bug crawled and bitten on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors and several other night watchers began to feel weak and their foreheads became hot. Only Minsk’s defense and physique were vigils that restrained the black insects. Talent is barely okay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Minsk is a bit overwhelmed: "The bites of these bugs are equivalent to magical weapons, magical weapons!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fifth-order sorcerer (the genius) of the five cult priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various sorcerers such as "frozen cold tentacles", "desperate curse", and "extremely cold shadows" are directly attacked or assisted, and the advantage that the night watchman can hardly achieve is once again suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holder" relies on the "Sacred Code" and its own abilities, and constantly uses "recovery", "treatment of diseases" and other magical techniques with "black" The anti-magic power of the Gloves restores the combat power of the priests, while several night watchmen in silver armor are tacitly blocked in the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the successive restoration of the priests, "God's grace", "God's power", "morality such as rainbow", "prayer" and other auxiliary magical techniques, aura of magic One by one, the four silver armor watchers were blessed, and their strength, physical fitness, agility, and will were greatly improved. The rest of the night watchmen, such as clowns and Minsk, worked hard to stop them from cult priests and priests. The attack of the Dark Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blessing of the gods, the four night watchmen held both hands at the same time, shouting loudly and attacking neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their black gloves illuminate a layer of darkness, the body is unspeakable calm and deep, and the giant sword that is cut out looks very ordinary, but But he was dyed with a faint black light by himself and his black gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several dark knights are blocking in front of them, there are "black dragon" blood, "rock giant" blood, "grey spirit" blood, but it seems like a landslide Under the heavy sword of the ground crack, the black dragon breath was dissipated, and a layer of mud halo on the rock giant was scattered. The weak aura of the "grey elf" was scattered, and they themselves were involuntarily repelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four silver knights in full armor continue to move forward and go to the priests and priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evil Shield" disappears under the Great Sword, "The Wall of Darkness" disappears under the Great Sword, "The Wall of Fire" is under the Great Sword Disappeared, the four priests and the sorcerer's defense around a priest disappeared, and they were smashed into two halves by the great sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their blood power is actually 'eliminate'!" In the underground palace, the big priest with numerous strange symbols on his head was slightly surprised, "Aalto The church has come from a total of four knights who have 'eliminated' blood, and one of them is a five-level knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eliminating" blood, Let all supernatural forces that do not belong to the true God disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, whether it can be eliminated is related to the strength gap between the two sides, and this true God can be appointed by itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is the purest and most orthodox blood of the original "Hunter" such as the Devil Hunter and the Wizard Hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other high priest shrouded in a silver robe to the bald priest: "Angra, you go to help a bunch of them, though only rely on them, still The ability to defeat the night watchman, but the loss will be great. The great silver-white Lord is just hopeful on the earth, and every power should be cherished and cannot be squandered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Angra priest smiled and smiled. The whole old man was on the verge of death: "The tribulation is the test of God. This coincidence also seems to be that this group of vigils entered this place in order to hunt down a magician. Near the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After such a long wait, there has been no abnormality. The judgment of the Angra priest should be a bitter coincidence, both on his own side. It’s the same as the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But still can't relax the vigilance, I will pay attention to the surroundings of the temple." The high priest of the silver robes replied that the arrays, traps, etc. arranged outside have been heated. The battle is destroyed, he can only rely on the sorcerer to monitor, and the focus is naturally near the temple with the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a formal priest, cult priest, the growth of spiritual power becomes a thing of faith, no longer as a preliminary exploration around the spirit of the magician Ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchers rushed on by the four "elimination of the blood" Paladin's charge and the "holding", "clown", Minsk and others. Surrounded by cultists. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they prepare to escape into the Black Forest separately, to stimulate the rescue signal, so that the cultists can not block, a black shadow from the ground, From the trees, from the sky, the dense horror shadows will surround the night watchers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
