			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Heidi’s angry expression, hehe smiled: “There is nothing to be angry about, so many elements are the Arcanists and I have the same opinion. Why should I waste time writing a paper that doesn't have much value? This kind of guess that directly uses the result as a premise can only be used as a reference for mathematics and ideas before it can be confirmed by experiments. Which big Arcanist wrote the paper to refute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick turned over the "Arcane" and "Magic" in his hand and shook his head: "Five The Great Arcanist did not submit the paper, and the Speaker of the House and the Lord of the Storm discussed the application of the system of transformation equations in the Douglas system under different reference systems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Did the Speaker have a thesis?" Because it was not his own review, Lucien first heard today that he had read Annick's "Arcane". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is clearly concerned about Oliver’s paper last month, but not as much as the middle and high level arcanes, because it merely suggests an explanation And the transformation formula associated with this, and no experimental results and phenomena can confirm this possibility, thus interpreting the speed of light experiment. On the contrary, Douglas is more interested in the transformation equations. The past transformation formula has not been much after the establishment of the Bruker electromagnetic system. Signs of adaptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Douglas’s thesis, Lucien gently beheaded, this is the most ideal development, and the Speaker’s in-depth study of the core of this paper, with him The basics of arcane and the understanding of the electromagnetic system, I believe that will soon see what, there is a preliminary idea and ideas, then will not be prepared without any psychological and knowledge to face the special theory of relativity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lu Xien watching the papers don’t talk, Heidi is still reluctant to whisper: "I know the teacher, you are the same as the Arcanist, not willing Reducing identity discussion is only a speculative paper, but the Arcane divisions that support the volatility theory such as the electromagnetic system, the light and dark system, and the Necromancer do not think so. They think that the teacher has been hit by this paper and realized that he has The bias, this silence and retreat, there is no written rebuttal, which indicates that the volatility theory began to recover the past 'territory'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "territory" here refers to It is the problem of the existence of "ether", that is, the medium of wave conduction in vacuum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several students who are excited about the rhetoric that the supporters slandered the teacher and seem to be intolerable than insulting themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what do they think about the photoelectric effect, the Brooke scattering experiment?" Lucien held the "Arcane" and "Magic", it is obvious Some of the arcane masters they know and come into contact with are unlikely to have a similar discussion of surnames published in these two journals. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the light quantum hypothesis explodes a brain and gets the Silvermoon Medal, those who rely on classic experiments to insist on the volatility of the arcane masters Far from it, he can only rely on the journal to understand the progress in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint snorted: "They tried to construct a more complex wave model to explain the photoelectric effect and the scattering experiment, but they all discussed the content of the last name. There is no real value, and even the arcane review is almost impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what are you angry with? Can you say that particle theory can explain classic experimental images?" En smiled, and the supporters of the wave of supporters still quite agree, but without theoretical guidance, they are doomed to be in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi’s attitude towards the teacher’s carelessness is very puzzled: “But they are destroying you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When they come up with specific experimental results, they can really hit my face." Lucien looked at the two journals and found that after the proposal of his own light quantum hypothesis, confirmed by Brooke's experiment, the parliamentary particles The supporters of the arguments are on a rising trend, and many arcians have changed their minds, thinking that light is likely to be a strange particle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because classical experiments still cannot be explained from the perspective of particles, the traditional fluctuations of electromagnetic system, light-dark system, and necromantic system say that the supporters’ sites have undergone the initial intense After the shake, it gradually stabilized. In this issue of "Arcane" and "Magic", high-level arcane masters such as Akin, Pesor, and Tina Dimos expressed a certain degree to Oliver's thesis. I agree, but they are also more cautious. They think that they need to design experiments based on this theory and seek confirmation. Before that, they can't be too convinced that this is a good sequel to the repeated subversion of the paper by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher's attitude made Heidi quiet, and she curiously asked: "What kind of paper did you complete this month? I seem to see that you are writing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A small essay on tensor analysis, published in the journal Nature, you have time to look at it." Lucian answered without raising his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Katrina and other students are all bitter, "Nature" journal has more than three years of history, and gradually "the most ugly in history" The title of the journal, even the towering towers who are good at mathematics, often sees dizziness, do not know what the above paper is talking about, especially the Evans geometric analysis method that the teacher and Mr. Levski cooperate. A series of papers such as research is the best tool for hypnosis at night for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw that they didn’t talk, looked up and smiled at them like a smile: “The mathematical foundation is well done, and the research of arcane and magic can be relatively easy in the future. Do you need me to increase my guidance in this regard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, teacher, I suddenly remembered that I still have an experiment that I didn't do, go first, you are slow Looking at the paper slowly, I went to Ophelia." Heidi was full of smiles and said that he would step back outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia was assigned as her assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Heidi as an example, excuses such as arcane experiments, magic analysis, and construction emerged from several students in less than ten seconds. Time, there is only one person in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Annick strangely: "Do you need to experiment? Or do you really want to strengthen the training in mathematics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick scratched his head and his voice was very small: "Teacher, my arrangement is to read the journal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Sean looked down, he discovered that two journals of Annick were in their own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Iron Golem sent his journal from the Audit Committee, Lucien just carefully read and learned, found this issue, due to Oliver's thesis Dazzling, flooding is basically a discussion about this aspect, and a few are the results of other fields or the improvement of magic. The discussion of the electromagnetic cyclotron proposed by Annick and Sprint is inconsistent with the theory. People pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not enough, Lucien thought about it, took out the paper, raised the feather pen, and wrote: "There are problems in the practical application of the electromagnetic cyclotron. Think a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Destruction Theater", there are illusory stars that collapse and annihilate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the end of this horrible dark universe, a little light and soft but firmly revealed, seems to be the last symbol of civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get close, you can see that this light is a towering and artistic light-colored magic tower, each window has bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study room, Oliver became a loose pajamas, Oliver smoking a pipe, holding a feather pen in his face, and it took a long time to write a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes have the common fanaticism of the artist. It seems that all the inner feelings are ignited and emanating, and they are devoted to the creation of this long love poem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the sound of Taling’s singing sounded: "Master, the Speaker of the House of Representatives came to visit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Oliver frowned and put down the feather pen. The "poet" and "playwright" who were interrupted by the creative passion were always a bit violent. He pushed the paper with love poems rudely onto another pile of paper on the desk and swept out. A blank, then took a deep breath twice, restored the calm of the surface, and then got up and went to the magic tower door to meet Douglas, whether it is generations or prestige, Douglas deserves such respect. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Oliver led Douglas back to the study, and frowned: "His Speaker, something to find me? I am not in a good mood during this time." Ok, there are some urgent things to do, and I will not leave Aringe for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
