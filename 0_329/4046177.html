			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Mr. Evans’s serious look, Annick, Reyia and Heidi all nodded in ignorance. The learning and casting of apprentice-level magic requires repeated analysis and practice. They have personal experience. Now it seems that the basics of arcane learning are the same, but why is there a bad feeling in the heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, the first time you contact these arcane books, we will not bother you to learn. When you understand something, let us ask you again. Annick stood up and was very polite. "We just meditation and learning magic at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien now teaches them that there is no The problem is that a magician who has never touched an arcane can only read the basic books of arcane and magic to reach the level of guiding others. It is really incredible, even if the legendary arcanist can't do it. Therefore, cautiously, Lucien laughed and said: "I will guide you at this time of tomorrow." And I have prepared a special gift for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow? Mr. Evans, do you think these arcane books are simple?" Reyaliya asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien considered the language: "I will teach you what I understand today. This is the case in the future. I will learn while guiding. Oh, this way It can also give me the pressure to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will thank you Mr. Evans." Heidi replied cheerfully, anyway, she read the books herself. It was very difficult, so I was not worried that Mr. Evans would delay her arcane learning and thanked Annick and Lei Yiya for their own thanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the three apprentices returning to their rooms for meditation, and other apprentices were divided into two small groups to discuss, Lucien finally felt that the surrounding environment was peaceful and there was a good The learning atmosphere was so relaxed, so I leaned back on the back of the sofa and took out an arcane book left by Heidi:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The Philosophy of Magic Mathematical Principles, hey, and the name of Sir Newton’s work is very similar.” Lucien’s eyes lit up, just patronizing and quickly reading, ignoring the book, “Oh, and from the catalogue, it’s also about 'force’. It is also a calculus, a bold assumption, and rigorous proof. However, the examples given above seem to be combined with the need of magic, such as the problem of the magic of the stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the catalogue, Lucien went back to look at the preface: "...all magical research, in the end, will eventually come down to the answer to some abstract questions, such as: What is 'I'? What is' How does the world '?' the world appear? What is the beautiful 'system' that we observe? What is the relationship between 'I' and 'World'? So I added the word philosophy to the name of the book."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...We explore the world, strive to sum up the laws from phenomena, and then use these laws to deduct other phenomena and explain, construct, and create magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend Douglas"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally the work of the great Arcanist Mr. Douglas. Hey, the preface and the content of Sir Newton It’s not the same.” Lucien’s appearance of calculus is not surprising, not to mention the previous “Arcane” journal that was seen at the Aalto Magic Party, which is the beginning of the middle level, within the spell model. The large number of irregular lines, faces, etc., means that there will be mathematical methods for the pioneers to seek accurate calculations, especially after the magic principle is named Arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seriously began to look at this arcane book, a feather pen on the round table flew up, unattended on white paper Write and draw, verify the inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mathematical method of "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" seems to be more systematic, more systematic, and more symbolic than the book with similar names on Earth. The definitions of the various concepts are fairly clear and accurate, making it easy for Lucien to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flies past, until the light coming in from the window becomes dim, Lucien finds himself forgetting to eat even lunch, because this arcane masterpiece It also bridges the link between the laws of the world, mathematical methods and magic, and allows Lucian's knowledge to finally be linked to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not the strength of the soul, wait a few days to read this book and the "Movement of Magic Principles to the Model Construction Process" "Signal Meaning of Construction Graphics", I was able to start to analyze and construct the second ring, or even the magical model of the three-ring magic. I really hope to get a better idea from Felipe's mouth, which was used by high-level magicians!" Lucien is not sorry. I thought about it, then I stretched out without a picture and stood up from the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien fired the flames and burned the parsed manuscript paper. He nodded: "Where is the dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first floor restaurant." Catry Na replied with respect, Mr. Evans has been learning for almost a day, and using so many white papers to calculate, just such hard work and serious attitude is worthy of respect. You must be as diligent and hard as he is, and become a formal magician as soon as possible, so that you can help your parents get rid of the troubled situation for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............in the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, I heard about your seriousness and hard work. It’s no wonder that learning ancient magic can also become a formal magician before the age of twenty. If you become a middle After the magician, there is a good level in the shadows and light. I will consider asking you to be one of my assistants.” Astar expressed the praise of the elders on the magic road. As for the latter sentence, it is only a compliment. Form is not a real promise. Not to mention the difficulty of becoming a mid-level magician, the study of shadows and light can make him feel that a good middle-level magician can count clearly in one hand in the entire magic parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him, Mercedes stood tall and squatted on the table, with a white napkin under the fluffy neck, with a The fried fish is doing a fierce battle, screaming from time to time, and licking Astar with the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Thank you Mr. Astar for your compliments, just getting in touch with arcane, I can only use diligence and hard work to make up for the lack of time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your attitude is really satisfying, but," Astar’s words turned, "Evans, you don’t want to study blindly," Magic Philosophy The Mathematical Principles and Calculus This mathematical method is what the formal magician needs to learn. Oh, I mean the official magician with the Arcane level. You need to look at other basic books of Arcane and Magic now. Then add a copy of "Magic Creatures"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have learned most of the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" today... Lucien answered silently, then nodded. "At night, I started to read "The Foundation of Magical Geometry" and "Common Algebra Problems.") Also guide the three apprentices to "prepare" tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Soul Library, these two pages are turned on one page, Lucian probably looked at it, plus the previous impression, it is determined to contain European The books of geometry, analytic geometry and equations are not undoubtedly thought in the heart. "European geometry is called high tower geometry here. The fifth article causes the derivation of non-European geometric content to be exactly the same. It really has the feeling of being on earth. But there are also many different places, such as souls, such as spiritual power, such as stars that cannot be found, such as different 'Tai' elements. Is it different between the micro level and the macro level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest issue of the "Arcane" journal Lu Xien has of course been included in the soul library, most of the 30 articles are the application of complex functions in various fields, such as the mental power The sphere is intercepted into a study of planar fields. A small number of articles are new elements found in spectral analysis. It can be seen that they are the latest research hotspots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of problem involving the deepest mysteries in the world, can not be explored at the level of Lucien, can only be temporarily suppressed, asked to Astal: "Mr. Astar, I don't know if you can teach me in advance what the council will surely give me the idea of ​​meditation?" I can become a second-ring magician one day before I can learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just a parliamentary plan to prevent you from not guiding the magic apprentices. A magic contract will be signed at that time." Astar smiled. "But yes. For high-level magicians, there is no problem with proper violations. However, you need to demonstrate the potential that is worth investing in. Oh, staying in Sterk for a long time, a little used to using their business language."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is very used to this negotiation: "Mr. Astar, what potential do you need to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You have become a formal magician not long after you become an adult. I am very satisfied with my spiritual talent. If you show good potential in your own arcane learning or teaching these few days, I will give you the idea of ​​Brooke in advance. "Astall put down the knife and fork and kept a gentle smile. Brooke seems to be a great arcian. Lucien smiled and replied with a smile: "Looking at the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" in the afternoon, I feel that I am still Very talented for arcane talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hope so." Astar nodded gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
