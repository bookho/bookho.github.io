			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a black forest at the junction of Charlotteville and Lentate, the pale mist shrouded the vast surrounding area, allowing the magician’s spiritual field and knights Intuition and so on are suppressed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient civilizations ruled by the elves, because of the "conspiracy" of the "abyss of the abyss", there were many space cracks on the earth, some of which were very small and useless. How long it took to disappear on its own, and some did not break open, connected with the layers of the abyss, forming a channel for the devil's invasion. Later, with the help of the elf tree, the elves sealed most of the similar cracks, but in a few places remained With the effect of space disorder, this black forest is such a situation, so it has become a good choice for magicians to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hidden valley deep in the forest, the rich mist entangles a "invisible" magic tower - here is the "Destroyer Tower" The important base, thanks to the nearby environment and its own direct transfer characteristics, even if the church has always known that this forest contains many magicians, even cardinals and epic knights have searched and found it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is why the church did not go all out. When they did not want to search and planned to wipe this black forest directly, the Western War broke out, mainly The power was taken away from the Aalto front and the plan had to be put on hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Big lysis', with your 'time stop' can quickly resolve the battle." On the edge of the valley, a flaming magic robe of Plyhill Give Douglas a scroll, then turn to look at Ann Ardold, like a smile, "even if it is me, making this scroll is very difficult, cost a lot, old fox, after the battle, the spoils have to be picked first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she paused: "And, I contributed the 'Destroyer Tower', if the plan failed, let it be churched." Destroy, oh..." She looked like "you know." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower that can run invisible is the source of the name of the Tower of the Destroyer, but because their headquarters has changed to a better place, I can't use it for a while, but I put it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Plyhill’s name for Annod, Fernando’s heart is 10,000, and so far he still didn’t want to understand President Anord. Why do you believe that Sharp will not sell, just to gamble, in exchange for future beliefs? Really old fox! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold smiled and said: "Although you have been a Master for two or three hundred years, I still look at the elders you grew up with. Courtesy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He evaded the light answer and made Plyhill dissatisfied, and snorted heavily: "Elderly, who was originally asked to marry me was rejected? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H, Fernando suddenly heard the black history of the president, suddenly burst into laughter, he knew that Plyhill had a husband, but died in the church. On the hand, I can't think of a paragraph like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annode’s old face was reddish, and he smiled and said: “At that time, I was a strong man, what is like now, hey, old, really old... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plyhill himself also prepared a way to escape his life, so not too entangled with the problem, the expression looked slightly dignified next to Annode The Necromancer servant, curiously asked: "Is this? I feel that he is very strong, but it is a bit wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My corporal servant, quite The extraordinary creatures of the ninth order..." Anord repeated the explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be a servant of the dead, no wonder to give me the feeling of being dead." Plyhill nodded, and Congas, who was next to him, was hoarse. Road: "Old fox, wait for this action to be successful, your necromance servant has to borrow me to study for a while, I found that it is different from normal, perhaps hiding a little mystery of death."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beginning of Plyhill, everyone unified the name of Anord as the old fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also found out, but I still haven’t figured out why." Annold spread his hand and refused to accept Congers’ request, nor did he readily promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus two-pointed red awns flashed a bit, and when he was about to continue to ask for it, the fat and bloated Nelson opened his mouth coldly: "Maybe Alfonso immediately Just looking for it, do you still have free chat? Is the magician of Sirvanas so unreliable? Then I have to reconsider the danger of cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plyhill looked at the Amandata quietly in the shadows and gently daggered: "The news came from the south, and Ketonia is still chasing Rigg, so we each act according to the plan."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned and flew back to the "Tower of the Destroyer". After all, if there is no magician inside, it is easy for Alfonso to see a problem and get rid of it in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nielsen and Congers each flew to different directions, far beyond the scope of Alfonso’s ability to search and pay attention, and beyond The first time to support the scope of the "Destroyer Tower." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amanatha in the shadows has long since disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, you first arrange the magic array, let it be in a heavy rain, it is best to last for two hours." Anord with Douglas, Fernando Hidden in a nearby grave, and then cast strange spells, completely integrated into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speculates that Alfonso will arrive here in an hour, because the traitors get a bit of misplaced information that would mislead their choice of road without hindering their discovery. Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Fernando's arrangement, a flash of lightning cut through the sky, squatting on a big tree, letting its branches burnt and burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, the dark clouds condense, the heavy rains, the water and the mist, make this place like the end, the senses are more malfunctioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoude is not afraid of Alfonso’s discovery of the storm as a trace of maneuvering. After all, it is an important base for the “Tower of the Destroyer”, with similar interference. And the hidden array is just normal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the "Destroyer Tower" in torrential rain and darkness is more and more like a monster waiting to swallow the world, Anord and Douglas is under the influence of "mechanized mind" and other spells, and maintains an absolutely calm state. Fernando, who does not need to join the attack, looks at the dark forest with a slight nervousness. If something goes wrong, the big hall The magic organization in the area will be more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goal is coming..." A gust of wind blew through, bringing the Amanata tablet without the undulating cold sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Douglas, at this time can not help but straighten his back, holding the "big cracking" reel firmly in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, a beam of light entwined with flames descended from the sky, exposing the fog, illuminating the darkness, and slamming into the tower of the Destroyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The translucent magic tower illuminates a symbol and pattern, forming one defensive magic array, blocking the light column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an old man in a red cardinal robe appeared in the air, his white eyebrows were white, his wrinkles were deep, his face was sly, Hate and pleasure, and around him, several cardinals and paladins provide protection and coordination in accordance with the battle formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nearby forest, a bishop, a priest, and a night watchman with black gloves emerged, blocking the route and stranging the hidden magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoud and Douglas did not attack immediately, but waited for feedback from several other Masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Discover hidden gold-level paladins..." In the storm, Congers' voice first came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nielsen also quickly responded: "There are several high-ranking vigils who secretly set up the divine array, ready to start at a critical moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are enemies in the shadow..." The words of Amanata are simple and straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alfonso is more careful, bringing more people than we think, and wanting to ambush in the event of an accident." The connection said to Douglas, "Hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Congas, wearing a gorgeous black robe, suddenly flew out of the ground, Whiteson’s skull in lightning Underneath is a gloomy icy luster, two rows of teeth open, making a silent howl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
