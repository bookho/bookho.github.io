			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the darkness of the fingers disappeared, the forest seemed to be in an extremely quiet state, and even the bugs crawling under the decaying leaves did not make any noise. . . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien? Evans..." It seems that a bit of a low-pitched voice is coming from the black clouds and the diffuse fog in the air, which is rich in flavor. Not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Dracula, Lucien represents a period of memory that is absolutely not pleasant, as a bloody family who has lived for many thousand years. Prince, the whole world, including the gods, can be ranked in the top ten strong, actually deceived by a reptile design that has just been promoted to the six rings, suffered a most asymmetrical failure, clearly that it is a threat And the breath can crush him, but he can only look at it in vain and watch him summon the ancestor and be wounded by a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I think about this, Dracula feels a burning pain in his face, and his inner humiliation is irritating. He wants to find a chance to chase Lucien, the other side. However, he is deeply succinct and concentrates on arcane research. When he goes out, he can't lock his whereabouts through the starry sky. And Dracula is always a bloody prince who values ​​his face. He can't do things for a long time near Alinge—even if you don't face It may not be able to get over the guardian of Aringe, so things are delayed until today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for the long-lived blood family, this is not a delay, especially the legend of Prince Dracula, which can illusion a bustling city in a dream. If you are a strong peak, you may be a long-lived species for hundreds of years. The time of ten years or so is really like a dinner time. There is no delay. But who knows, this is less than a decade, Lucien actually The Sixth Ring Master has grown into a legendary peak, standing on the same level as himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a miracle he has never encountered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that his "boss" is in a bad mood, his mood is unstable, just like every time he "woke up", Fitia snorted helplessly. Courtesy and polite: "Mr. Evans, the Valley of the Flamestone is the headquarters of our Dark Council, and an important meeting will be held soon, so unless invited, outsiders will not be close. Do you want to be an enemy of the entire Dark Council?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to her is justified and well-founded. . Lucien smiled and said: "I just came to visit Mr. Rhein and can wait for him nearby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, even if someone invites. Lucien is also reluctant to enter the Valley of the Flamestone, which has a strong lock, and has a legendary peak that is hostile to himself. In addition, the ancient time Dragon Denis is not good for human beings, and rushing in is equivalent to entering the Holy Land. City Lans, let life be in the hands of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Dubnaar’s voice stood up again: "If Mr. Evans has an invitation? We Werewolf invites him to attend the meeting and witness the meeting. Fair and fair, other book friends are watching:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasdall was shocked, and the former Prince of Wales who had struggled with Lucien Evans How could you suddenly invite the legendary magician of the Magic Council? Did Silvermoon rise from the west? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment. He felt that his brain was like a paste, and he couldn't understand his thoughts. He had to feel that although he was clever, he was still like a clown compared with the profound wisdom of his prince. There is no way to understand his inscrutable plan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Du Bernal, do you understand what you are doing? You are an ugly monster with a wolf hair in your brain." Hidden in the darkness of the sky Dracula said proudly and sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, Prince Dracula is still a very ceremonial gentleman, but opposite is an ugly stupid werewolf, a sinister and sneaky reptile. No politeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal laughed: "This is the right of our werewolf family and the right to be recognized by all members of Parliament..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say I want to attend the meeting." Lucien interrupted his words in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ka, Dubnaar’s smile is stiff on his face, and he is shocked and annoyed: “What are you doing?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not listen to the meeting, destroy the plots of Danissos and Dracula, what are you doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you don't say it early!" Dubnaar's roaring voice stunned a strange bird in the forest. Isn't this an excuse? Excuse, don't you understand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already said..." Lucien couldn't help but lick his forehead. What have you been thinking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the dialogue between the two, Dracula at high altitude fell into silence, Nasdell felt more and more that his brain could not keep up with the rhythm, Fitia The green eyes like a cat's eye flashed a bit, and the corner of the mouth couldn't help but twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, Mr. Evans, you can listen to this meeting." Fatia couldn't bear to let the conversation continue, the voice said softly, while She waved at the white-clawed black cat who was moving in the direction of Dubnaar. "Sco, come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fitia, you What do you want to do?” Dracula was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fythia completely ignored his "boss" and said from his own self: "Because the content of the meeting was leaked in advance, the strong demand of most members Next, the meeting will be held outside the Valley of the Flamestone to prevent some ambitious homes from strangling the opponents with the help of the shackles, so there is no danger of attending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tia!" Dracula's voice had already brought a hint of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little black cat "Sco" raised his claws, ignoring the call of his "master" and marching toward Nasdall. It likes to play with the big dog. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Lucien snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fythia laughed and said: "Stannis will come and listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s also very curious what the results of this meeting can be.” Hearing the “King of Nightmare” will also come and participate in the Valley of the Flamestone. Lucien is willing to go and listen, first know the direction of the matter, and maybe Can also play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Lucien was willing to participate, Du Bernal laughed and laughed. It was an excuse. I have seen you through it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasdall is more admired than it is, and I feel that the Prince is really farsighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the sky is a lot lighter. It seems that Dracula has left, and Fatia gestures: "Mr. Evans, I will take you to the Valley of the Flames." Outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she blinked and smiled shallowly: "It is a wonderful thing to find the sun, a good-looking novel: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since her appearance, there has always been a faint melancholy and feeling in the smile. It seems that the whole world is emotionally complex, but this time, her smile Pure and bright, like a snowy flower blooming on the northern ice sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attitude made Lucine think back to the information she had seen, Fythia, not the legendary magician of the Northern Shahran Empire. "Ice Queen"? The legendary third-order powerhouse that disappeared during the Twilight War! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ice Queen"? Lucien asked this legendary title in confusion, how did she become a vampire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fythia smiled: "This is a long and boring story. In short, because of my own problems and my soul, I can only rely on transforming into blood. To continue life, yes, don't discuss too much arcane with me, I am afraid that I will burst my head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a bad name?" "Lu Xien humorously laughed at himself, walked into the forest with Fitia, and secretly said that she knew many ancient mysterious rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current majority of legendary magicians have nothing to do with the ancient magical empire, a small number such as Douglas and others at the end of the ancient magical empire is only a high-level or sorcerer The standard is far from the core of the empire, so the legendary magicians who truly understand the ancient singular rituals only have a few of the Dark Mountain Ranges and Pope Viking, and the former’s status at that time is far less than that of Fitia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——At the end of the ancient magical empire, there were only two legendary peaks in the three empires, except for them, which belonged to Fythia Ten legendary third-order magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
