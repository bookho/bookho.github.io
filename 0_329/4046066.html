			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————A terrible earthquake, Wenchuan’s feelings, well, a quieter opportunity to update a chapter directly, the evening update to see the aftershocks set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Ya'an's friends are safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello’s serious old voice came from the office: “Who?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am, Victor. Othello, I have something to discuss with you." Victor converges on the smile and regains a gentle and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello’s voice was silent for a few seconds, no doubts: "Oh, Victor, are you worried about your Royal Highness’s evaluation of your music? Come in, the door is not locked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mood seems to be very good, even a rare laugh, it is likely to be praised by Princess Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him who has not motivated the blood to become a knight, in order to maintain his aristocratic status and the security of the territory, the best choice is of course to get the Grand Duke or have inherited Princess Natasha of the Earl of Violet, and Princess Natasha is very passionate about music. As a director of the Music Association, Othello has a great advantage in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker twisted the brass handle, slowly opened the door and walked in with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello is sitting behind the red wooden desk, the black dress is straight and neat, there is no trace of rain, the serious expression is relieved, the face is ruddy and full of spirit. Holding a quill in his hand, writing on a piece of paper, rustling on a piece of paper, after hearing the voice of Victor, he looked up and said: "Victor, the princess of the princess is very familiar with the piano concerto you have written in the last year. Interested, I am very curious about the brand new instrument 'Piano' and I am looking forward to the concert next Saturday night. Don't let her down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well?" After seeing Victor, Othello naturally saw Lucien, who was behind him and closed the door with a light hand, but he kept the aristocratic etiquette, did not ask directly, but waited Victor's introduction may be because Lucy's clothes are neat and elegant, the appearance is handsome and calm, and it is easy to make people feel good. Othello is not unpleasant, just a little strange, "Victor brings a stranger. Young people come to what I do "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He has obviously forgotten what they have seen wearing linen blouse Lucien side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is happy, although it is certainly difficult to know the negotiation, but he is full of fighting spirit and psychological preparations for frustration: "I am very happy to have the appreciation of His Royal Highness Princess." I am full of confidence in the concert. Othello, this is my student Lucien, Lucien Evans, he wrote a great piece of music, I want to ask you to comment, you are serious The subject matter of the music has a recognized authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a musician with a surname, it does not mean that Victor is not good at communicating with people, not knowing how The autistic person who deals with people does not directly say that he wants to change the track. Instead, he compliments the Othello director slightly, so that he can watch Lucien's music without any prejudice and resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello is not surprised. If Lucien is Victor’s true disciple in music, he introduces and recommends to other musicians. It is normal for the performer and the critics to use it. The reason for the use is often to evaluate the student's music or performance. Therefore, Osero's serious face is in a good mood with a polite smile: "Victor, when did you receive this? Student? You have been preparing for the concert in the last year. I have not heard of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without explanation, Victor just smiled and handed the score to Othello, I plan to wait until he finishes watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello took the score, the expression became serious again, and the score was carefully watched, and the melody naturally appeared in his mind, and soon he was brief and powerful at the beginning. The lingering notes left a deep impression. He frowned slightly and started the whole movement with such notes. He could foresee the fierceness behind him. This is his music career has never met in the past few decades. However, it seems that I can smell a taste that I don’t like, that is, the music trend that Aalto started in recent years with his own emotions and other things as the theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, behind the intense melody, but Osero seems to have the feeling that his heart will stop beating, until the first movement has been slowed down, then he found that his palm is all sweat, the paper on the edge of the score Getting wet and wrinkled is like experiencing a thrilling fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rejection of this theme music, let Othello recall the first movement, can't wait to tear the whole music, let it spread, not let Others are infected with this music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you hate it again, hate it again, Othello gave a very high evaluation of the melody of the first movement, and the two emotions wrestled inside him, let him The wrinkled eyebrows have not stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I watched all the movements, Othello was silent because I didn’t know how to evaluate it. In recent years, Music Review, Symphony Guide, on this theme music. It is a welcome attitude, and Aalto's music mainstream is also under the leadership of Princess Natasha, so it is impossible to comment from this aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this prestigious aristocratic musician does not lose his identity to the details of his music for a young man who has just begun to compose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for praising his melody, Othello will not go against his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet makes time seem to be slow, Othello finally puts down the score, and speaks slowly and slowly: "I have a very good day to see a piece of music." The young people are happy, but Lucien, music is the voice of the world to praise the Lord, is a sacred and broad religious tribute, I hope that you can put your talents and minds more on this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your evaluation, Othello's governor." Lucien did not respond politely to his heart, and praised the Lord himself. It was the biggest joke at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Othello did not mention a word for the music, but Victor is very satisfied, so that he can not criticize the music itself is an attitude, so he will be true The intention is: "I can get your praise, I am happy for Lucien, I believe that Othello should have seen the value of this piece of music, I want to show it to everyone at my concert." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Othello did not think, directly vetoed Victor's proposal, staring at Victor, long-term ruthlessness as a nobility and director. Show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor also looked at Othello without hesitation: "Othello, why not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Othello was slightly surprised by Victor’s tough attitude, but he immediately thought that he “understood” Victor’s idea, that is to use this music to further his reputation and status: “The track has been given to the Princess’s Highness. After that, changing the track temporarily will leave her with an unreliable impression of the association. Victor, do you want to use the development of the association in exchange for your own reputation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Victor laughed, full of fighting spirit: "If there is better music and not to show down to the Grand Duke, the Princess, then it will make their impression of the association worse, Othello, if you disagree, I will Go to Ms. Silvia and ask her to pass the score to the Princess, I will not give up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Your own majesty was challenged. Othello stood up like a lion and looked angry. Hector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor showed his own tough attitude and began to softly persuade: "The Grand Duke, Princess Her Royal High is not prejudiced for the theme music, and even can be said to be more like, I believe that Othello's director can imagine how they react after hearing this piece of music. Why not make them more satisfied and happier? This is also good for the Othello director."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no big names on the top of the nobility, and the theme music that expresses inner feelings will not form a trend within a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger on Othello’s face began to fade, and he was old, and neither his son nor his grandson had the power to stimulate blood. They must be paved for them. The road, let the glory of the family pass down with the title, and look at Victor's attitude, even if he does not agree, he will try other methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief thought, Othello looked at Victor seriously: "Two days before the concert, I will listen to your practice once. If there is no problem, I will temporarily Change the track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
