			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purple elegance, tranquility and relaxation, a family crest is also engraved on the carriage, with a powerful metal armor arm in the middle, holding a silver The shield is surrounded by a bright, elegant and bright violet around the arm, and the outer part of the violet is a wall of coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the coat of arms of the Waurit family. In addition to the name of the Violet, this family also has the title of "Shield of Truth". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped in front of the red long carpet in the Hall of the Holy Sepulchre, the guards stood on both sides, the aristocrats who had just entered the Hall of the Holy Sepulchre, and left the seat again, at the Earl of Hain Under the leadership of the Count of Lafayette, waiting in the foyer to welcome the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, while musicians and musicians such as Victor, Rhein and Lucien were far away in the small foyer on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage door behind the carriage opened, a tall, elegant evening dress, tall woman walked down, she had a bright purple long hair, The eyebrows thicker than ordinary ladies fly obliquely into the corners, and the dreamy deep purple pupils do not look rough, but have an atmosphere, bright feeling, coupled with a firm and straight clean nose, not thick, not just right The pale red lips are really a beautiful woman. Compared with Silvia, like a lily, she is like an angry violet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the Countess of Violet, Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious and middle-aged woman Lu Xien once saw, always staying with Princess Natasha, not leaving her half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is a five-level knight who is half taller than most men, and his legs are long and strong and go to the front of the carriage. Open the door for his father, Waliotte, and help him to walk down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waurit also has a long purple hair, but because he is over 60 years old, he has experienced the death of his wife and eldest son. Unlike Natasha, who has an unparalleled knight talent, it is now only the strength of the second-level knight, and it is basically forced by the secret agents of the church and the family. Therefore, the purple is white and the old is elegant. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is similar to Natasha, even if it is already this age, it is a gentleman who makes young girls scream, even younger than others. There is more mature taste, but he is both a devout believer and a woman who has devoted all his feelings to his wife. In the past ten years, there has never been an rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the year was the Earl of Violet, the love story of Grand Duke of Vaorrit was a classic that was rumored by many bards, and he came out of the Hall opposite the Stormy Strait. The kingdom of the king, the result fell in love with the princess of the king, the only daughter at first sight, and then overcome the numerous evil blocks, and finally became an enviable companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Natasha, the Grand Duke of Ouoliit slowly walked from the carriage to the red carpet, watching how much since he had memories. Changing the sacred and solemn hall of the holy shrine, thinking of his own life, thinking about it, he looked at his daughter sideways. Now his only troubles and worries are her. She is both proud and has nothing to do. Accepting, laughing and laughing, the surname is stronger than the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foyer is in front of you, and the grandfather of Vaoliet converges on his thoughts and maintains a dignified and sly smile, equating with the Earl of Hain and the Count of Lafayette. Natasha greeted the nobles of her own family, and Natasha always smiled with a smile, both as if she was comfortable with this kind of social etiquette, and seemed to be alienated from the whole communication until she saw the west in the small entrance hall. Ervia, the perfect smile, and the man's etiquette with his right hand to care for the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien suddenly felt a little weird, with his own insights into the "group books", just between Natasha and Silvia. The performance, seems, probably, maybe: "This is too wasteful..." Although I didn't think I would have trouble with them, Lucien was sorry for other men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Hein’s loyal lord finished the ritual of the knight and smiled: “Oh, let’s go in, or else we have these old guys. Young people can’t relax themselves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His son, Harrington’s Viscount, as if a handsome man like a fire, is working with Princess Natasha Conversation, the concert at the St. John's Hall is important for the aristocrats who like music, but the communication before the concert begins is equally important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short blond hair, the head of Lafayette with the headgear, and other people became quiet. The church was the host of the Principality of Vaolirit, the bishop of the Cardinal, the priest of the Holy Spirit, Sir Saul, who had lived a semi-hidden life. Cardinal, will also come to the concert? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the matter is really so serious? Isn't it a small mess of low-level magicians, black knights, and cultists? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they haven’t asked for an exit, a simple and simple carriage, only the carriage of truth in the carriage, is wearing two silver armor but not The cumbersome knight drove down and slowly drove to the door of the Shengli Hall. Then, with the help of the knight etiquette, an old man wearing a white robes, a white bonnet and a white hair came out. He looked ordinary. Tong, kindness and chaos are like the next grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the steady pace of Cardinal’s cardinal, the nobles have a thought: “The cardinal can’t see that it’s two hundred The strongman of many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the small hall, with the appearance of Thrad, Lucien was imprisoned by the anti-magic squad in the body Suddenly I felt a warmth, like the light of the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His soul has reached such a terrible level?!" Lucien was slightly surprised, knowing that he was placed in the hall of the Holy Ghost, before he came, The Ice and Snow Avengers were hidden in the laboratory and have been converging their spirits. They passed the inspection of the guards and experienced the horror of the anti-magic squad. It was the feeling that their mental power could not be detected at all and could not be cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Sarde, because he is rarely known in Aalto, Lucien also heard that he is a Holy Spirit priest. It is the strongman in the so-called legendary world of this world, the group of people standing at the peak of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many such characters in the Church of Truth. It is said that there are only a dozen of the Cardinals in the Cardinal, even if they are part of the Knights of the Church. The head of the regiment, the giant of the referee, the leader of the monk, and so on, according to the rumors heard by Lucien, should not exceed thirty. You must know that this is the most powerful force in the whole world, including the alien space. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien felt the power of Cardinal Sald, the hands of his side were tightly attached to his body, his eyes twitching slightly, seemingly afraid Burned by the invisible light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s performance is very clear when he was suspected of having problems with Lucien. When Lucien was ready to take his eyes back, Rheinland It feels like a sense, the head is turning, and the gaze is in contact with Lucien’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not panic, but the generous and the Rhine, the Rhine mouth tilted up, revealing a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two naturally regained their gaze and looked at Cardinal Sald, who had already reached the foyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Ouerit took a step forward and took up Thrad’s right hand, slightly bent his knees, and kissed the knight’s etiquette: “The Truth Forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a pleasing to Sarder, but a tribute to theocracy in this case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde helped the Grand Duke of Vaolirit: "Oh, you are very happy to see that you are still so healthy, and very happy to see our lovely little Na Tasha is getting more and more knightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two supported each other and walked into the hall of the holy shrine, Natasha was a little behind, Supporting the other side of Thrall's arm, while other nobles walked behind in strict order according to their respective titles and their respective lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nobles walked into the hall, Victor smiled at the Rhine Road: "We should go to the background to prepare, Lucian, you are waiting for you here. Friends, take them to the small stands in the west of the hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lotus, Herodotus's friends are mostly nobles, they are not willing to go to that The small grandstand, the opportunity to lose communication, as far as Felice is concerned, her uncle, her cousin are noble, powerful, and powerful characters, and are the objects that are sought after and surrounded by such communicative occasions. . Looking at their backs, Felice sighed slightly and walked in with Victor and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the small hall, only the housekeeper Ace and Lucien stood here, one is waiting for Victor's relatives, and the other is waiting for his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
