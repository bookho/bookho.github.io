			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sonar River that crossed the city after half a lap was fierce in the rainy season, and the waves rolled and roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the riverside descended a temple, Nob took the beautiful scepter made of laurel, and his face was waiting for Francis. He didn’t have anything. I think that the priest of "the resurrection, the god of fertility and redemption" will suddenly ask for a duel with himself. Why does he not wait for one more day? By the end of the night, you don't have to fight with extremely dangerous and unknown opponents, because it is impossible for the dead to make a duel invitation. Not long after the morning of the theological meeting, Nob got the god of war that Nina conveyed, asking the moon god to kill with the underworld tonight. Vitan and Francis, to lead out the El, who made the gods uneasy. Therefore, he quickly got in touch with the Luna, which was hidden in the nearby forests, by special means. At noon, he discussed the evening plan together in the temple. How to raid, how the priests cooperate, how to guard against the betrayal of other sects, how to use the support of the war master to draw together several factions, suppress several factions, how to kill Liviathan, to provoke the greatest resurrection, fertility and redemption God, let him not control his own shots. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as Nobu discussed with the moon god Asin, he thought that victory was in sight, and the hateful opponent was about to fall, the formal duel "invitation" was sent. In front of him, this made him vigilant. What scares him even more is that he sees the great moon god showing a hint of fear, the daring and unscrupulous fear of the priests of the El God, against them. The fear behind him, so he also had a strong uneasiness. In the past, no one had ever heard of the "Resurrection, the rich and the god of redemption." No one knows how far He has reached, only through the "theological debate." That transcends the description of the imagination to speculate one or two, how strong will his high priest be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob originally wanted to delay the duel until the next day, but Francis did not give in, and this duel, initiated in the name of the glory of the gods, was in the theocracy community. It is a thing that cannot be refused. If anyone escapes from concession, then the god he and his representative will be discredited and abandoned by the believers. The duet proponent will have the right to attack whenever and wherever, regardless of the occasion, so Nobu can only Bold the scalp and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, there is a great possibility of being a false god, a liar!" Nob looked at the crowd gathered and whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sonar Valley is rich and prosperous. Before the control of the iron fist of the war, the sects were less confusing, and the duels between the priests often occurred, so Hu Su People in M ​​City have experience with similar things, knowing that even if they want to watch the fun, they have to hide far away. For example, on the other side of the Sonar River, the duel between the gods is not like ordinary people fighting. It is so dull, sound and brilliance can be transmitted far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of resurrection, fertility, and redemption is so powerful, and his priests are certainly not weak. I see the high priest of the moon god returning to the embrace of the moonlight this time. On the bank of the sound of the waves, a young man said excitedly that he was a shallow believer who dominated the underworld and now has a tendency to change his letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not necessarily. It was just a theological debate. It's awesome to wait until the real battle." A Luna devotee retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, Ramiro held his hands together and listened quietly to the discussion around him, wondering: "I collected before I entered the Eldo Peninsula." The details here, how can there be no 'resurrection, abundance and the god of redemption'? The goal is to point to the god of the moon, Axin, is it the silver moon Aitna impersonation? Is his position falling to this extent? Or other forces Man is pretending to be a god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face has become the standard of the Baler, standing in the crowd like a drop of water falling into the sea, let people Undetectable and distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two young men dressed in simple plain white robes set foot on the steps in front of the Temple of the Moon, and the noisy sounds on the banks of the river calmed down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same way, with a big sword, Lucien stopped at the place more than ten meters in front of Nob, closer to the Sol flowing through below. Nahe, solemnly said: "Today, we are fighting for the glory of the Lord, and we will not die. Nob priest, are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't die, these two guys are too confident, right? When I heard this, Nob’s fear of fear also caused a strong anger: “Leviathan, are you, or Francis?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pseudo-God priest, good, good! I want everyone to know who is the pseudo-god!" Nob's madness to "Leviathan" is angry, and even heard the great luna in the back temple. The roar, "When I kill Francis, I will challenge you, this duel does not allow you to refuse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: " Nob priest, you have to remember that the dead can't challenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Wait!" Nob took a deep breath and would be angry. Emotional depression, the most important thing now is to face Francis, can not be teased by Leviathan this demon to lose reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis has not spoken, slowly pulling out the giant swords from behind, then slowly moving forward, eyes staring at Nobu: "I judge you on behalf of my Lord." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I represent you the great moon god to discipline you." Nob's duel made Lu Sian's eyelid jump and almost laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Temple priest Shen Sheng announced next: "The duel begins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis hands The sword, the right foot slammed into the front of Nob, and the giant sword slammed out, letting the wind stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble’s silvery white moon “lights up”, and there are layers of light and dark illusions in front of him, just like the darkness of the moon at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the phantom in the Great Sword, it seems to be lost in the fog and temporarily lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nob seized the opportunity, the laurels of the sacred scepter, the surrounding temperature suddenly dropped rapidly, and the sharp horror of the ice condensed out, densely like a ball , wrapped in Francis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was relieved to see Francis as a priest of strength and melee. This type of spell may not be able to seriously damage his body, but he can He freezes and limits his actions, so the balance of victory tilts to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the hockey puck, Francis’s mouth showed a smile, and the giant sword swayed and screamed, screaming, kneeling, behind, behind, On the left and right sides, suddenly two identical "persons" emerged, and with the same smile, the same giant sword slammed like a nine-person force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these nine figures are different on the giant sword, some are electro-optic entanglement, some are green acid splashing, some are flames, some are dry and rot Some are colorful, some are crystal cold, not like a phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice ribs hit Francis, who did not dodge, and condensed a solid layer of ice, and with the impact of Francis, the ice layer burst into numerous gaps. , turned into beautiful pieces, and he had no wounds on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine figures were shot down, and they had no time to pass the caster buffer, nor did they have time to avoid Nobu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble's body is broken like glass in different light bursts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the distance, Nob suddenly drilled out, but the whole person looked very embarrassed, and one class of magical throws, but Francis was completely un The effect, with eight "virtual shadows" hard to live in front of him, hand up the sword, it is necessary to kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning, acid, flame, wither, toxins, ice, death, mental shock... strong resistance to magic and magic... this is true It is the ability of the Hydra..." Onlooker Lucien focused on analyzing the blood and strength of Francis. "Only showing the ability of the seven-day knight, but he certainly has reservations, the initial estimate is eight... ... Eight-level Hydra blood knight, the aristocrats of all countries can be ruled out, the Knights of the Beidou and the fallen knights of the Dark Mountains can also be ruled out. It seems to be the secret power of the North and South Church vigils or other pseudo-god churches." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-level Knight of the Day said that there are a lot less, but there are not many sayings, this kind of character can’t come out for no reason, except for the night watchman team. The part of the incognito and the members of the pseudo-god church are similar to those of the night watchman organization. The information of other eight-level knights, the magic parliament is more or less, even if it is not detailed, the specific blood is still recorded, so Lucien goes through Contrast, did not find compliance with Fran Personnel strength and blood characteristics of Sri Lanka. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
