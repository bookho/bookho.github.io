			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto, in a room at the bottom of the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a darkness here, and there is no movement other than the sound it makes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha sitting in the room seems to have adapted to it, and the glowing blood of his hands and face has faded a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dark vision, she looked at a thick stack of letters in her hand, singing the melody silently from time to time, even if there was no sound, it was light and lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the last page of the envelope, Natasha suddenly smiled and slaps her right hand: "Hey, blessing in advance? Lucien, you must be learning me." I am waiting for the "Music Review" on July 30th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really good to have a friend, otherwise I’ll be mad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The cool breeze on the sea blows away the sweltering heat of October, and the waves hit the long embankment from time to time, splashing countless white foam. In the distance, the sky is wide, the birds are flying, the boat is passing near, and the arch bridge is seated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Pearl of the Sea" Stuart is similar to the ones that Lucien saw in the film from the last life, with more than a hundred gathered islands at sea. The foundation was established, and numerous canals were densely covered like spider webs. Only a long seawall was connected to the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the special boat of Stewart, Lucien looked at the buildings on both sides of the canal and slowly moved back. There was a kind of shopping. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, distinguished guests, in fact, every canal of Stourke is equivalent to the streets of other cities." See the semi-old boatman with a pointed boat Lucien has been constantly watching and watching, knowing that he was a traveller to Stuart, and therefore enthusiastically introduced: "There is St. Mayor's Church, where is the Sturk Holy Spirit Monastery, where the Truth Clock Tower , there is a prayer minaret..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien leisurely blowing the sea breeze, very satisfied with the introduction of the boatman: "This should be the temple area of ​​Stourke ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in every city, town, church, regardless of size, there is a church. But there will always be an area where church buildings are concentrated, such as the area around the Golden Cathedral on the east side of the Aalto Noble area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so it’s not crowded. When you enter the business district, you will see countless boats and merchants from different countries, travel The boatman replied with a smile and drove the canoe through a magnificent stone arch bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the surrounding environment becomes noisy, with a boat or docked next to a building, or directly into a large building with a waterway entrance. The bottom of the object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lingua francs of different accents echo in the air, "Bronze Fair", "Silnar", "Kintal", "Bank", "Loan ", "10 grams", "squid", "sea bream", "orange fish", "steel", "wood", "slave", "delivery" and other words from time to time into the road to the ear, a scene The trading scene of the bargaining price is in sight, and it is many times more lively than the market area of ​​Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole city is beating its vitality, and it seems that even the sea breeze that has been blown has a taste of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s more prosperous and more commercial than I thought Stewart.” Lucien boasted sincerely, from the modern city of the earth, It seems that I like this kind of warm scene, and I seem to enjoy the quietness of the setting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boatman with a strong pride said: "We are on the edge of the Stormy Strait, communicating with the north and south, and there is a natural deep-water port, so The best transit point for countless goods is the most ideal free city, and our Stewart people are born with business acumen, the first goldsmiths association, the first bank, the first voucher transaction was born here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Communicating things?" Lucien heard something wrong with the boatman's introduction. In Sterk's mention of the East, it obviously refers to the Holm and other countries opposite the Stormwind Strait. Can you communicate directly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boatman who often deals with travelers and merchants and wonders about Lucian’s doubts, and talks: “Guests you should have heard of the Holm Kingdom’ Nightingale's yarn, unique jewellery, 'Golden' porcelain from the Kingdom of Camelot, various spices from the Principality of Calais, the top tobacco bar in the Kingdom of Buriana?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The boatman got a response from Lucien and talked about the surname: "These four countries are across the strait, but because these goods are very profitable, they are monopolized by the church. Only the nine aristocratic businessmen authorized by the church can Organize the fleet to go. Hey, so the wealth of their nine families can be bought together to buy Sterk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are the nine? Lucien asked curiously, whether it was one of the nine, and that it would be able to use the trade as an excuse to send magicians to the opposite side of the Stormwind Strait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Viscounts of Wright, Baron Captain, Baron Monkach..." The boatmen counted one by one, but unfortunately there was no name for Granny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi's interest disappeared and smiled: "Is it better to continue to introduce me to the two sides of the building?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, that's Bank of Wright, it's Monkach-Hawthorne Bank." The boatman pointed to the magnificent architectural road on the left. "That's the 'Epic Gallery', that's the Mitchell Sculpture Gallery. ', that is the 'Canjin' bank..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien always looked at the direction of the boatman, and saw that the appearance was like gold foil Shiny three-story building. Many sharp boats come and go at their doorsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So close to Granny’s bank, Lucien did not ask a word, quietly watching the crowds and buildings near it, let The boat that took the ride passed by the building with the three-character sign of "Can Golden Bank". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien This is a cautious approach. Since you already know the identity of the Stewart City Contact, there is no need to take the time to take risks. It is best to observe first. Granny and his bank watched the situation of other magicians looking for the door, preventing him from being seen by the church and catching people through his fishing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the three months of travel, through the meditation of the official magician, the soul and mental strength have obviously become stronger, in the soul Constructed seven magics of "frightening", "silent phantom", "burning hand", "mage armor", "steel lungs", "tolerate elemental damage", "out of control circle", and are preparing to build "foot sole wipe" "The oil" escapes magic, so don't worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lucien found that even if there is a formal meditation, with his own spiritual talent, it is estimated that it will take a year to advance to the second ring, even if he is early You can analyze the second ring magic, as you want to become a middle class, at least ten years! This made Lucien more eager for the Magic Council, especially the efficient ideas that Felipe mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boatman’s chattering, the boat sailed away from the business district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After more than half a month, Stewart was famous for his seafood restaurant "Shark". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sat down at the table with a white table cloth under the guidance of the waiter, while ordering the food and looking at the brown hair, squatting The obese man with the black and thick cigarettes, under the personal protection of several guards and the personal welcome of the restaurant manager, slowly walked up the stairs and walked to the small restaurant on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the goal of Lucien's goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long period of secret observation, Lucien basically determined that he was not exposed, and the only problem now is how to contact him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grunny is always with the guards, maybe even the existence of the Dark Knight, his strength seems to be very strong, and his character will certainly guard against the church The night watchman pretends to be a magician to test himself. The guy who is full of secrets like Lucien really has a headache and how to win the trust. It is impossible to use the professor's identity anymore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I accidentally heard that Glennoff was going to entertain guests on the second floor of the "Shark" restaurant tonight, and Lun’s heart was moving, waiting in advance to see if No chances are found. Because the big rich and underground giants like Granny, the best and most convenient way to entertain guests is always in his villa hall. Even if guests like seafood, they can return the chef of the "Shark" restaurant. It is necessary to come directly here. This made Lucien smell a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the stairs, the sound of screaming under Granny’s heavy body, Lucien saw the waiter in the restaurant take a stack of newspapers. Come over: "Respected guests, this is today's "Sturker newspaper" and past newspapers such as "Music Review" and other famous newspapers. Next our pianist will play the famous musician Lucien Evans "Moonlight Sonata" and "D Major Cannon", I wish you a wonderful enjoyment before the start of dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
