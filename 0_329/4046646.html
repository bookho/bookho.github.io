			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, the basic courses in the current magic school can give apprentices a good foundation to attack the official magician level, but low The arcane and magic knowledge required by the magician to the middle and high level is huge and complicated. It is difficult for them to master it by self-study. This is also the number of middle-level magicians under the development of the Arctic in the past decade. There is no reason for rapid growth, but the high-level magician has increased a lot." Brooke nodded in agreement with Douglas's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the new arcane theory and results have not reduced the difficulty of lower-level promotion to the middle, or the same. Oliver is slightly worried about the authenticity: "Graduate apprentices and low-level magicians are the foundation of the parliament. If they all go to high school, the whole council will inevitably fall into the trap."瘫痪.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-level magicians, archmage, legendary magicians, although superior in strength, diverse in magic, but can not spend their minds to do small things, the entire parliament The usual operation is based on the form of “release task”, and a large number of graduate apprentices and low-level magicians bear 80% of the small tasks inside, which makes the various aspects of the parliament orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So for the time being, we only set up a high-level school with a scale of several hundred people. We will select excellent talents through certain selection methods. After observing the effect, we can promote it appropriately, but not It will affect the operation of the parliament. After all, the middle and high level arcane masters themselves must learn magic, study arcane, explore the world, go out for adventure. If there are too many high schools, they must contradict their number and free time." Douglas said himself The plan, for this matter, he fully evaluated the number of teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A certain selection method? Apprentice assessment?" Fernando is more concerned about this issue, and Helen has started his own research, but the focus has become the wave of electrons. Grain two elephants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said with a funny smile: "Universal entrance exam for higher magic schools? Is it divided into mathematics, language, magic analysis, eleven faction theory and magic practical test? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was purely reminded of the "before" experience, which made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High School of Magic Unified School Entrance Examination? This method is the most fair, at least better than the recommendation of the middle and high-level magicians and the school to choose their own fairness." Douglas agrees The form of the exam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the supervision of magic, the situation of cheating is inevitable, and the fairness and justice can be guaranteed to the greatest extent, although there are selfishness and desires in some places, supervision examinations The magician is likely to be bought, but this can be avoided by various means such as patrols, and by recommendation and self-selection, it is difficult for high-level magicians and school administrators to be inclined to appreciate and appreciate. Related, arcane and magical abilities are often ranked last. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Douglas nodded: "This is called the Unified School of Advanced School entrance exams. The specific knowledge and practical application skills are assigned to the Panel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his right hand and rubbed his brow, and closed his eyes by the way, my heart was dark, I was just joking, but this way, "Ivan Scodian, "Evans Problem Set", "Evans 9+3 Theory Detailed Explanation", "Three Years Preparing for Two Years to Simulate a Year's Sprint", etc. may start to be popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't it necessary for everyone to test the eleven big factions?" Vicente raised the question, "mathematics, different magical languages, magical analytical skills, primary Alchemy ability, soul and body foundation understanding, actual arcane research ability, magic practical ability to use must be tested, and then let the outstanding graduate apprentices, low-level magicians choose their own three factions, after all, everyone has their own good direction And the field that you want to go deeper in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s voice retorted loudly: “When the trend is now, the major factions are getting closer and closer, electronic The volatility surname and the particle name of the light make the electromagnetic and the elements integrated into the microscopic field. If you want to study it in depth later, it is impossible to have a broad enough faction base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can be considered after admission, anyway, when they do not learn well, they will be expelled from school, which will give them enough 'power' to make up their own foundation." Oliver smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is contrary to the original purpose of holding a high school. If they are self-study, they will not have a high-level magic school." Hathaway said gently. The vibration has just disappeared. Anyway, the electrons have already shown a fluctuating surname, and the real world has not collapsed, so there must be an internal reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And the courses of senior schools can no longer be like apprenticeship schools. They become classes in a unified class, but give them a certain degree of freedom. For example, integrating the previously mentioned knowledge into different courses, which are different by different middle and high-level magicians. Time rotation for teaching, then students choose the teachers they want to listen to according to their own progress and foundation, choose the time that suits their own schedule, choose the courses they need, and have rich time and ability, they can also take other unrelated courses. To expand the knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This does not limit them to their previous choices, but also their subjective surviving surnames. After all, they are not children. It is an excellent apprentice who graduated. It is a low-level magician. Our goal is to let talented people learn in a short time, so that talented but diligent people can learn slowly and make laziness for a long time. The willing people will finally have the opportunity to initiate a sprint by selecting and arranging the course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien did not say that they were assessed by senior magic School education can be promoted in order magician, arcanist is the best answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Lucien found that all the members of the highest panel were watching themselves, and subconsciously asked, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect Lucien to be so interested in teaching students, no wonder that Katrina, Reyia, Annick are so good, middle-aged arcades of 234 years old. The teacher and the magician did not come out casually." Douglas laughed. Fernando also snorted: "When he was a teacher at Douglas Magic School, he was known for his novel style and unique style, but he was wearing a hat that violated tradition." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all major magic schools are popular in the lecture mode of Lucien, after all, he is already a great arcian, a nine-ring magician, imitating success It is a culture that no society lacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded. "This kind of autonomous arrangement is very good, and it also makes the publishing task less complicated. The middle and high level arcanes can choose the class that suits them." Time and curriculum, Lucien, why not be the principal of the School of Advanced Magic? I hope to establish a successful new teaching model."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at everyone Seeing that I avoided all my gaze, Lucien understood that they didn't want to take on this matter at all, so they kept silent when they talked, and nodded: "I am only responsible for establishing the model and operating abnormally. It's best to pick a high-level arcane master to host, which is actually easier than the members of the Arcane Review Board. The specific things can be done by a middle-level arcane master like the Wizards Management Department."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Lucien was silently licking himself, the director of the Institute of Atomic Research, the director of Sky Radio, the president of Magic University... his part-time job is really unspeakable, it seems Both teach and teach Hung No. ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? That magic school senior what to do with the name" Douglas looked at Oliver et al. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien once again interjected: "To distinguish it from ordinary magic schools, why not name it by college?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Holt College." Oliver likes to take the name, "Holt" is the "mystery" of the ancient Asovan pronunciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have no interest in naming, and Lucian is too lazy to write the name to throw "Holworth" and other names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the name was confirmed, the issue was transferred to the follow-up, and the meeting ended soon because there was no big justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is the Evans experiment announced?" Helen finally woke up from indulging, and asked directly whether he had discussed it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas dignified: "I think that the "Arcane" journal should be published in the name of the last name article to discuss the pre-conference debate, Lu Xi'an Explain very well, help them accept the wonders of the micro-world, plus the volatility surnames under the special conditions of the particles that Shanghai Servi insisted on. There should be no large-scale cognition of the world collapse. After all, the discovery of electrons is only a few years, but the world view Being subverted and stunned should be spread across the parliament. The extreme people inside will even have insurmountable suspicions and unconfident attitudes toward microscopic particles, arcane and magic, which will also make them stagnant."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is also the night, the particles are also waves, such things will make people doubt that the world is unreal and exploration will never be effective, the world is dominated by mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
