			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword is ordinary, exudes a soft but firm color, with the silvery purple in Natasha's eyes, the crystal clear, the sword front emerges Two illusory gaps that seemed to split the world, and in just one second, they reached the head of Congus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the Lich is no longer the heart and neck, only the head of the soul can effectively reinvent them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monotonous black and white ash appeared under the "pale justice" with an illusory and transparent crack, revealing that two red needles have not yet emerged from the solidification The half-god lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the sword is like a piece of rotten wood, Congers' "Spell trigger", "Spell order", "Spell" Sequencer and other "stress-type magic effects" can not function properly under the influence of the mysterious existence of the dead spirit world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" A shrill scream screamed and Natasha flew straight out, eyes, nose, mouth, and blood in the temple. overflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the "half of the demon sorcerer", but the impact of the mental turbulence under Congers' extreme anger, so even if there is "pale justice" "Resist, Natasha was also hit hard, and Lucien was even more uncomfortable, dizzy, blurred in front of her eyes, and all the nose was full of blood." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very good, very good!" Congers made a squeaky gnashing voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lucien and Natasha both surprised, so that they can’t destroy him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Congers' dark cloak was separated from it, and the white skeleton slammed all over the floor, quickly decaying and turning yellow, making a stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the skull, two deep cracks appeared, and the sacred gentle light shimmered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the skull is split, and the golden gimmicks inside have the same unrealistic imaginary wounds, as if they have broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the protection and protection of magic, Congos suffered almost the same damage from the last time he was shot by Silver Moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pale justice", the evil nemesis, this moment, it is a legendary weapon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of Silver Moon converges, firmly suppressing the black and white gray solidified on the left hand, lest it spread, affecting Lucien and Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be back! I hope you can come up with a better little trick!" Congus issued a declaration of hatred, the golden skull slammed into three Half, falling to the ground, it sounded like a metal, and his soul slowly faded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This didn't kill him completely! Lich, no, the magician is really a headache!" Natasha is half-relaxed and half-joking Complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was lying on the ground and couldn’t move. The severe pain made him feel a lot of energy, but he was very happy, no matter what, himself and Natasha. The two rely on the existing resources and the ingenious reaction at hand, actually killing the demigod lich once, even if he is stuck in the legendary level for hundreds of years, it is still a true legendary strong! No matter what you look at, you can crush yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all magic, cough, magician, the most deadly, the most difficult to kill, and we are facing a half god Lich!" The breath was not smooth, the pain went into the brain, and Lunian spoke intermittently, but as he took out the "Song of Water" pharmacy, he finally stabilized the injury, "and he retired in the world." The means was consumed last time. From the situation just now, he must be born again from the talisman of the main material world. Once and for all, plus the time to reshape the body, we have more than one day of absolute Safe time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stood up and carefully took Lucien’s left arm back to him: “More than a day, we Can make some arrangements, then as long as there is more delay for more than a day, or the fragments of the dead spirit can not be out of control like today, Hathaway mother and your teacher should be able to come, and the longer the time dragged, half The god lich may not dare to continue chasing, oh, can your hand be connected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a cold hand touched Lucien’s face, healed his pain and passed a firm will. Natasha frowned slightly but deliberately made a joke to distract Lu Xi’an’s attention: “You finally know The pain that my abdomen was pierced by? The healing power of the great knight is both a good and a torment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of cold sweat slipped from Lucien’s forehead and was Natasha wiped it clean. After a few minutes, Lucien just smiled and said: "At the time, I couldn't see it at all. You smiled and talked about how to grill your internal organs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you want to bake a piece for you now? Must you pick it up? How is it healed?" Natasha saw that the long torture suffered by Lucien was finally over, so she asked Doubt in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "Aitna just let go of the control, let the debris of the mysterious existence of the dead spirit get a breath, if not rely on my blood power And the increase in mental strength, he may not be able to control it. At that time, whether we can escape to 300 meters in time is still unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly moved the left arm Lu Xien evaluates: "Raise your hand and do some simple movements, but more complicated movements are difficult to complete. Needless to say, more elaborate gestures can only be used later to cooperate with the Necrotic The limb regeneration magic and rituals are completely restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sequelae of no permanent surname, Natasha is a little relieved, with a smug smile on her face, slanting Raise "Pale Justice" and make a gesture of celebrating victory: "Haha, although I have not been able to completely kill the demigod Lich Congers, I am definitely the first to kill one in a positive confrontation with seven strengths. The legendary knight! It’s great! Great!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is excited to walk back and forth, her cheeks are slightly red, and she is more beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the adventure life I imagined. The tacit companions, the powerful enemies, the desperate situation, the more dangerous the more bloody battles, if you go back alive, I think this is a memory collection that I can't erase for a lifetime! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the same for me. Lucien looked at Natasha's lips and said seriously. "But don't pursue this dangerous battle, or you will fall sooner or later." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if it weren't for you, I would return directly to the area controlled by Lord Valen Hill if the battle of the Temple of War was over. Natasha has always been the conscious of the superiors. This time, she left the team and came to the Eldo Peninsula because she got a message from Hathaway before she entered the world. She knew that Lucien’s whereabouts were unknown, so she used the teacher to be the cardinal. The duties of the members of the bishops received the task of patrolling everywhere, helping Hathaway and the storm master to find Lucien in the inconvenient church control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two months of inspecting, she did not get any clues in the main area, so she came to the remote Eldo Peninsula.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Natasha again Excited: "I have to record this in the history of the Violet family. Later, people will say, look, this is a real knight, a brave and determined knight, hey, and her magician partner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she looked at Lucien with a smile: "It’s still necessary to record that she not only defeated a half-god lich, but also took it away." The first kiss of a great arcian, well, you can be a great arcian. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She expresses her belief in Lucien's future achievements. At this time, thinking about a bright future, she can meet the danger after a day with a firmer attitude. I hope to arm myself and not be desperate to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and then cautiously asked: "You don't feel like me, hehe, Kissing men with disgusting? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Moss licked his chin and was a little puzzled: "I thought it would be disgusting, but not as bad as I thought, it feels weird." This may be related to whether you are my best friend, or because you have never taken a kiss, is it cleaner? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her lips and seemed to relive the feeling just now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True "female man" "Ah, Lucien sighed silently, but she was very happy. At least she didn't feel sick, didn't think it was bad, and the progress was better than she thought: "Well, let's leave here and go to the Death Valley to see. I can think of other ways to drag the time that day. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
