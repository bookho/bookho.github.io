			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich black gas rises from the hall full of funeral coffins, from every place in the mausoleum, like the monsters of countless teeth and claws toward the top of the tower The door is rolling over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the "grave guards" in all directions worship in the direction of the spire, usually fierce and reckless, they are like a little sheep, close to the ground I can't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gas engulfed them, a little bit of the sun shining brightly on them, blocking the horrible death force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mausoleum, the horrible bodies hanging on the wall slammed into the roar of the fierce surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the weird hall, a lid with a black coffin was slammed open, reaching out of a dense bandaged hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White bandages present a disgusting yellow brown under the erosion of corpse oil and decay of time, and the unconscious evil voices echo with the roaring surroundings, making the mausoleum It’s terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien" and Ink lifted the trenches, aligning them with black air, separating them from the waves, letting them pass by themselves, pouring into the holy The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas is coming and going, and it’s going fast. After just a dozen seconds, they disappear, and the roar of evil is left. An illusory echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the "Sacred Door" has returned to normal, Ink sighs to the next "Askar": "It is finally over."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't talk to a lot of people." "Aska" replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Ink turned his head and looked like he was going to eat "Askar" alive, even though he was alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aska" snorted and no longer answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ink is angry and difficult, but he does not dare to fight in front of the high priest. He can only close his mouth and look forward to the wrong, never wanting again. Speak to the hateful Aska! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest noticed the movement here, but he was not too concerned, because the source of the contradiction between the two people is very clear, as long as it does not violate the law, Don't worry about this little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the high priest bowed his head and continued his "pray" to seek strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-ring illusion "resident phantom" can create a near-substantial phantom with sound, body temperature, odor, and action, and can also be preset Conditions, let the phantom face a simple situation to make a basic response, such as lifting the trenches when the black air comes in, such as Ink tries to answer the first answer "do not talk to the kind of person", then cold silence For example, when the high priest came over, bow down and say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After the gates of the Holy One, the black air surging, but silent, full of strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stock of whirlpool gas converges and condenses Lucien’s figure, he has changed back to his original appearance, black hood will face cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a feeling of the dead world." Lucian looked around and found that a little gray was filled with black air, making it solid and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a circular palace surrounded by patterns of sunflowers. I don’t know what the ground of the material is engraved with golden rays like the sun. Follow the trend of gradually rising to the center of the half-high altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the altar is a gold-carved dragonfly with a silver-white special material inlaid with a silver moon pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the entire hall is full of tumbling black air, bringing out strong death volatility and shielding the outside world, Lucien is no longer worried that the magic will be discovered. , superimposed one after another defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the "曰之冕" is a kind of magical thing that has a close relationship with the Necromancer. Lucien is still afraid to take it out, lest it be like a shark. A drop of blood dripped in the sea that often swims, causing crazy changes, thus attracting priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
