			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "atomic universe", the starry sky is boundless, the stars have their own colors, and they are merged into a strange and colorful scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Lucien and Natasha slowly emerged, cutting off the time and space connection with the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After finally, I will go to 'Silent Hell, find that special star." Natasha saw Lucien holding it in her hand. The black slate is quite popular with the beautiful but complicated patterns. They are highlighted one by one, and they are constantly lit up, just like the second hand ticking away. Moreover, each pattern is still full of dreamy water waves. It means that not only a woman, but also the male of Lucien, who feels that "spatial slate" is like a beautiful piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If it’s not the Dark Lord, and the King of Angels, the conspiracy wants to harm me, in it becomes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;'The demon prince, after this, the time-space slate, it should become its collection, and it will be many times more difficult to get it than now." Lucien extended his right hand and stroked it on the "space-time slate". Feel the illusory hooliganism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Desperate World" after the fusion of "Frozen Fortress" and "Abyss Stomach Bag", Gonheim is close to the existence of a god, if it is absolutely Some of the power stayed here, and even though Lucien asked Douglas, Fernando, and Hathaway to shoot together, it could only suppress it and it was difficult to break its fortress. In that case, Lucien would rather find someone to help "silent hell." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also curiously stretched out her right hand and fumbled for the surface of the "space-time slate", quite enjoying this strange feeling, and at the same time, the expression was slightly authentic: "Sure enough, there is a legendary peak that is eyeing you, or two..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to think that Lucien even did not rob, Ken's path to the gods, his arc of mathematics and the enhancement of magical power will also call for hostility and calculations. Now, this "prophecy" has become true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no fear or fear in her expression, only a little concern and worry. Full of strong fighting desires and high morale, this is because she She is very confident in Lucien, and on the other hand, she believes that this is an incentive and temper for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tweeted his fingers and tapped on the "space-time slate". But no sound was produced, only the dull roads spread out: " In this era, any strong person who wants to go further can't escape the whirlpool, unless he wants to completely abandon the times and hide far from the endless ocean or hidden space, but in this case, maybe one legend When you want to change the form, the first one will think of him, and the single person is the easiest to get an idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as the parliament continues to develop like this, I believe that the final victory will inevitably fall into our hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I am ready to meet challenges and malices from all sides."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s remarks are plain, but there is a strong will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smirked: "Even if you didn't become a magician, you should have great achievements on the road of the Cavaliers, right, 'The king of angels, completely fallen? Your<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Yang electronic cannon is really a world-class magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien for a long time, her language is quite trendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When other antimatter research is done and produced, the magician who is more than three or more legendary masters will no longer be a dream, just a bang." Lucien is half-jokingly jokingly. The power of the "Yang Electronic Gun" can be greatly improved, depending on its own magical strength or the preparation of the casting materials, and such advance preparation is comparable to the "eternal yang" horror. More, only a small amount of antimatter is needed, and the destruction of the world and the comet can be easily accomplished. Of course, the anti-matter synthesis requirements cannot be completed in the laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying, Lucien took out the morning crystal ball and read the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mirror of Destiny!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These "destiny light spots" gathered to form a misty mirror full of mystery. With the flying of the crystal ball of Lu Xien's left hand, the mirror began to sway, like a smooth water surface was thrown a huge The stones swayed in layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;涟漪 gradually subsided, the feeling of fog subsided, and there was a sly angel with thirty-six wings behind, suddenly, endless light in the mirror Presented, then flooded like a flood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Natasha on the side of the reaction first reacted, pulling a road that was slightly sluggish by this force and slammed into the "atomic universe." "In another direction, then I saw that the "mirror of fate" was swallowed up by a purely clean ray of light, and the surrounding stars were swallowed up, leaving a lifeless emptiness until the "cosmos" oscillated and the surrounding forces came in. It slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the power of the god of truth..." Natasha eloquently said to herself, this is the true God of worship in the past. Moreover, even if the name of the faith has retreated to the spiritual realm in her heart, it is still the "God of Truth", so when she confronts the "spirit" who has no wisdom and only pure power and rules, she will inevitably rise up and say no. Some unclear feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien eased the "Mirror of Destiny" and was shocked by the "Death of Truth" power, and gently rubbed his chin: " If you master the rules of 'Heavenly Mountain, and 'God of Truth,' the key moment can you use its power, and why does its power have such a degree? Is it an intrinsic transcendence or a cumulative change?·· ····”!-Sha looks at Lu Xi’an, the corner of his mouth is slightly tilted, the coldness of the silver-purple eyes is soft, the water waves are faint, and the words are smiling: “The Arcanist, you are always at any time. Research can be carried out anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha, professional habits, professional habits..." Lucien returned and replied humorously, "it seems plum Cantron is not completely degraded. I don’t know if he has not come to the relationship of all powers, or because he is involved with the special god of truth, the god of truth, he will not die, he will not Resurrection on the seventh floor of Paradise Hill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road Sean guessed why Mecanthon was not completely degraded. Although the "positive electronic gun" did not have the ability to trace the ontology like the "Sword of Truth", but under the purest destruction, Lucien believed that if Mecan Tron It is the arrival of all power, no matter what resurrection means he has, it is impossible to react and will be annihilated together by the "yang electronic gun"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it’s the latter one that might want to deal with you, the great arcane master who has mastered two or three legendary peak spells. Weaken and restrain the 'Heavenly Mountain, fighting in the abyss of power,' the king of angels, if not all power, almost no success, he should not make such a contemptuous mistake." Natasha fumbled his chin with his right hand Say your own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mecan Tron under normal circumstances is of course the strongest in the legendary peaks. When he is near Paradise Hill, he is very close to the class. God's strength can be found in the abyss, even if he is completely down, and the strength of the abyss is affected and suppressed. The strength is only the level of the worst legendary peak. If you don't go all out, it will probably only come to most of the power. It is equivalent to the strongest level of the legendary third-order, and is on the same level as Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, there are many magicians, and the magicians with different methods are much stronger. They can adapt to almost all combat environments and will not be weakened to a large extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also, 'the guardianship of God is as powerful as he was at Rentent at the time." Lucien recalled carefully, "but whether it is or not Because of his resurrection for Tanos, it is the embodiment of the god of truth. He is now only a new angel. To restore the power of legendary level, it takes at least five years to re-enter the legendary peak. Can't estimate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mirror of destiny" can only determine the life and death of Mekantron, can not clearly predict his state, but Lucian can according to various Signs make vague judgments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucian’s speculation, Natasha suddenly snorted and pointed to the iron planet that stood tall in the distance: " I think we will go home and discuss it again. Don't you think that the cold and dark universe is not as warm and warm as the living room? There are black tea and music, and we are not far from the door..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not leave the house?·························································································· ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
