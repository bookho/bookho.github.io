			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the half-height platform in front of the Temple of War, all the priests, including Nena, fell into a state of inactivity after the "spiritual storm" and appeared. Unspeakable silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien draped in a simple white robe, smiled and looked around for a circle, peacefully speaking to Nina: "Respected high priest, don't know if it can Declaring the results of the theological debate? I see Nob priests and they seem to have no further discussion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina’s body trembled and looked coldly Lucien glanced at him and then said to Nob and other priests: "Do you agree with the advice of the Leviathan priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob is subconsciously opposed, but mind It was empty and empty, and a rebuttable rhetoric could not be found. Instead, there was a description of indescribability, supremacy, and transcendence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between his eyes, his mouth violated his "willingness": "No, no opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have it." The priests of the gods of love and wisdom who lost in the first round of debates replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the priests struggled to hesitate for a moment, and also gave up their opposition to Lucien’s suggestion. Finally, there were three gods who could stay in the Solna Valley, even if they were removed from the resurrection. The god of fertility and redemption, the gods that others and others believe in are not hopeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nena’s eyes are half-shouldered, covering the mood, and the voice is faint: “According to the god of the supreme warlord, the winner of this theological debate will have three Position, their sect can get the right to preach in the Solna Valley, the three sects that won this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, she will be "supreme The description is used by the Lord of War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob, Bolkan and other priests held their breath, waiting intently for Nena to announce the winner, the stage and the stage, the atmosphere was extremely depressed, it seems Take a breather and the good results will be blown away by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is the sect of the resurrection, abundance, and the god of redemption." Nina's tone is calm and waveless, and the surrounding priests and the believers in the audience are not surprised. There is no inhalation, and it still suppresses dignity, because this is an unexpected result. Instead, "Leviathan" and Francis around him are as calm as usual, making people faintly believe in Els. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literacy of a sect priest and missionary and the reaction to the matter can indeed shed light on whether the deity of this sect is sacred and great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the sect of the moon god." Nina only spit out the word moon, Nob was excited to kneel down on the ground, his forehead sticking to the wood, the mouth whispered Praying and grateful to himself, "and the sects of the underworld."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest Bolkan, who dominated the underworld, shouted loudly, praising the underworld, thanking The lord of war, and the priests of the gods of thunder and lightning, gods of wind and rain, and other gods became pale, and the body seemed to have no strength, and the wind swayed as soon as the wind blew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nena said coldly and cruelly: "Before the sun sets, the temples and shrines outside the three sects must all leave the Solna Valley and believe in them." The people must change their faith, otherwise they will be driven out of the valley!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This!" The priests and believers of the rest of the gods stunned and looked at Nina, they I thought that expelling the river valley was the basis for slowly weakening the respective gods, but it was not so intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solna Valley is rich and fertile, and most of the middle and lower-level civilians here can fill their stomachs as long as they work hard, but once they leave, they are warned again. The other rich places of the main control refused, and you must fight with the beast, Warcraft, and the "monster" every day to get a little food. Therefore, all the priests understand that no one is willing to follow their own sects as long as they are not mad believers. After migrating, it is definitely a change of faith after struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the priests, there is no way to choose this way. Only one road can go to the end. Once you try to change your faith, the kind of spiritual surname will be swallowed up. Lose the soul and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nena is fearless of the eyes of many frightened hatreds, his right hand is lifted up, and the soldiers suddenly raise their swords and make a crisp sound. The dense black iron forest radiates a cool, sharp light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina did not look at them, and said to Lucien, Nob and Borkan: "Your mission in the Solna Valley must follow the laws promulgated by the Temple of War, otherwise it will be expelled from the valley." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, there was no celebration ceremony and no “encourage words”, she turned directly to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Nina’s back, Francis secretly preached to Lucien, saying in a relaxed tone: “It seems that the high priest of the war’s lord already has Killing our intentions, or saying that the Lord of War has the intention to kill us, otherwise it will not be so sloppy, hey, our description just raised the great El God too high..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of such a serious matter, he seems to care too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien “Trying to maintain” to live in peace, revealing a little horror in line with identity, experience, and surname: “What should I do?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, things are going to change." Francis told Lucian to go to the hotel to meet with El, Jacob, and Anthony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded solemnly, in the heart of the dark, is to wait for the god of lightning, the god of rain, the god of wisdom, the god of love, the earth god, the sun God's priest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the semi-high platform, the surrounding believers gathered up, the expression was full of desire, as if looking forward to redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all believers of the "Flame and Destruction God" Afando, and there is no contradiction to the "two-in-one" El God. After the "mouth cannon" of Sean and Francis, it was found that more than the horrible and bloody Afando, the heart is more willing to believe in the great "resurrection, abundance and redemption god", and enter the paradise of everlasting joy after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing their expressions, Francis smiled and didn't speak, observing Lucine's response without any disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice is mild and authentic: “The great El God is merciful. He did not give up the fallen world filled with pain, willing to use himself as a bridge to redeem you. Out of the sea of ​​bitterness, the great El God is also supreme. He is everywhere. You can feel and listen to it by making a sincere remorse in your heart and making a good deed in your life that meets the requirements of the El God." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great El God is not in other places, just in your heart. In this respect, I am not nobler than you, but you feel the El God in the first step. The forerunner of the teachings, I will be your mentor, teaching you how to 'see' to Els in your heart, how to get the redemption of the soul. I am not a priest, but a preacher."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has always been the person who has his own bottom line. He can't do anything to deceive others to believe in the devotion of the family. When they pretend to be deceiving the dwarves, they also exchanged them with "technical workers". So, now face When believers are more willing to seek a peaceful mind, witness the "real me" to describe teach them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Francis is right next to him, Ann Hughes is watching, Lucian is very interested to talk to them about super, self, self. concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, just tell me the truth, just talk about peace of mind, will it develop something similar to Buddhism?" Lucien is a little smirk . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucian’s words, these believers suddenly felt that their hearts were warm and peaceful, their eyes were slightly moist, and no priest of a god was willing to use this equality and embarrassment. The attitude is to talk to them, even when they are preaching, they are mostly threatened and intimidated, and they are assisted by magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Francis shook his head with a funny smile, it’s really a young man who just entered the “secret prayer” and has his own ideas, but if such a young person They don't have a set of ideas of their own. Instead, they will doubt that the performance of "Leviathan" was different before, and that talentedness will have corresponding performance and characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected evangelists, how can we pray, how can we see the great El God in our hearts?" A believer asked with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiles warmly, appease the people: "The specific prayer, the ambassador Ann Hughes will tell you, and before you pray, you must learn to let go, The emotions of distress, joy, excitement and pain in the soul are all put down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
