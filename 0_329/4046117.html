			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucine’s fall of the baton, the music did not sound as people imagined, but instead saw Lucien’s body squatting, both hands and arms clearly The ground quickly oscillates up and down, which makes everyone feel an eager and warm feeling, and the body seems to have accumulated a lot of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are puzzled and strange emotions have not yet come up. After Lucien’s hands swiftly swing, the batons forcefully pick up, suddenly, G The strings of the serenade serenade, the short, vivid and impressive notes burst out, just igniting the accumulated strength and eager emotions in their bodies, and they invested in the joyful and clear atmosphere brought by the serenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien with a pleasant smile, the baton danced rhythmically, regardless of emotions, expressions or physical movements, clearly showing a cheerful feeling. This allows the audience evoked by music to be infected by his performance and more integrated into the atmosphere of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His command is special!" Grand Duke Ouette was snoring as he swayed slightly with the serenade of the serenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher and Natasha did not go to the band rehearsal before, and they enjoyed similar ideas while enjoying the music: "Lu Xien seems to be trying completely Different from the previous command style?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limitations of past music trends, the symphony does not have a complete theme that contains the musician’s own thoughts and emotions, so the command It’s just a simple beat, no need to grasp and express the connotations and feelings that the original author wants to show, even if Victor and Christopher commanded Fortune and Twilight War, they were very excited and very Crazy, but only limited to the right hand baton and face expression, never and did not try to use their own conductor performance to drive the band's passion, to provoke the audience's emotions, to explain the meaning of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when music develops to a certain stage, the style of command will change, and Lussien, who leads classicism to the peak of maturity and develops to romanticism, The concert began to show the charm of the conductor, which is the art of command that matches the current music trend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no video material in the Soul Library, Lucien can only learn the performance of great conductors such as Toscanini and Karajan by introducing the article of the surname. And formed a set of their own command style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the direction of Lucien, the band’s each group performed very well, thoroughly illuminating the first movement with a crisp, fresh and happy atmosphere. After the outing, the audience who had heard the serenade in the Municipal Square was immersed in the music. The body swayed slightly with the flow of the melody, and seemed to want to start dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard in the pub, the street performer on the street, and the orchestra that can play in the Hall of the Holy Ghost have no way to compare, and still stand in front of the band. A talented musician, he is commanding in a unique, own style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reveals an intoxicating expression, and the command movement becomes gentle. With such a command, the second movement of the G major string serenade is gentle and pleasant. The sweet melody is melodious in the hall of the holy shrine, and it is melodious in the municipal square and the administrative district, and it is melodious in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at such a road, listening to such music, nobles and musicians seem to have created an object of love and beauty in the suburbs. And riding on the quiet and romantic illusion of the horse slowly moving forward, and the civilians feel that in the sunny weather, the boat is swam with the happy girl, and it is easy and rippling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody of arrogance becomes bright and powerful with the appearance of Lucian’s command movements, body language and emotions, and sometimes lyrical and smooth, bringing out the extravagance of the small step dance The style, if it is not a concert, I am afraid that many men will get up and invite the ladies and girls to dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fourth movement, Lucien became energetic again, driving the band to show the crystal clear, youthful and beautiful Rondo. The audience also indulged in the sensational and sultry music, until Lucien turned to pay tribute, and when they entered the first long break, they reacted and burst into enthusiasm and violent applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the serenade to produce such an effect!" Piola asked his companions in amazement and doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this kind of banquet’s surnamed serenade was not eligible for the elegant stage of the concert, and even if it was boarded, it would not be so Warm and sincere treatment, only today, Lucien? The concert of Evans created a little miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the previous events, this little band is full of good feelings for Lucien, can not be arrogant, without any ridiculously and honestly and sincerely exchange music with himself and others, Lucien? Evans is definitely a musician whose character, morality and music are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what really impressed me the most was not the music melody, but the strange and violent hands swinging when Mr. Evans began to command." I laughed and said, "I have never seen such a command. I don't think I can forget that scene for many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also, and That swing seems to affect our mood," Piola and Sharon said at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, Christopher laughed at the Grand Duke of Vaolirit and Bishop Sald: "It seems that Lucien really brought us Surprise, the command can still be like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, his command seems to make music better, let us be more infected." Waou Ritter’s grandmother recalled the music and nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha said with confidence in Lucien, and it’s true, but before the concert is successful, it’s always awkward. But now she is completely relieved, smiling and listening to them, thinking: "What new ideas are there in the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Victor, Felice and John also sighed with relief. At least this serenade was very perfect and very beautiful. Lucien would not be criticized for this, but his command was very different from what he had seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first concert of Lucien, starting with the G major string serenade, mobilized the atmosphere, and now everyone is looking forward to it. The next piece of music and his strange way of commanding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............With the physical strength of the Lucien Knight, I didn’t consume anything, so I went back to the stage after a short break and did not let the mobilized atmosphere cool down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your previous command method seems to have a good response." After the band, Rhein whispered softly, "But this is a brisk serenade, etc." Destiny 'They will be even more surprised.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned to him with a smile, walked to the front of the band, bowed slightly, closed his eyes, raised his hands, The expression is quiet, like a still oil painting, and it is like a stone carved statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere seems to have solidified with the preparations of Lucien, making people breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music without emotional resonance is pale and powerless. After Lucien closed his eyes, he seemed to be in another world in a completely quiet atmosphere, remembering In the past, ordinary but warm life, and parents who may never see again, when they are around them, they don’t know how to cherish, they squander the goodness at random, and now, when they miss it, there is always a heartbreaking body. The pain of hollowing out, it comes from the irreparable regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The play of destiny makes you fall into the world, farewell to family and friends, the sternness of fate makes yourself and the friends around you face the danger of death several times, making you think The desire to learn magic quietly cannot be satisfied. Whether it is a gangster, or a night watchman or a cult believer, they all seem to lick a face, screaming and intimidating themselves: "Accept, don't resist, this is the fate of the arrangement!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to accept such a fate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon the resistance to the so-called fate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon your efforts, struggle and persistence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! Never accept! never give up! As long as you are alive, never give up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression was stunned and he swayed his arms and swung down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful and large swing of the arm gave Lucien the whole person to tremble, and then Lucien himself consciously shook the whole body up and down with the rapid rhythm. It seems to be twitching in general! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
