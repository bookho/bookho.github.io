			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being Felipe’s eyes staring, Lucien’s heart glimpsed and thought of one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is Viscount Kareldia or Felipe, they are sure that they are destroying the "Pale Hand", and if they do nothing Quietly watching and ending, I am afraid that it will cause Felipe's great doubt. If he can't help but venture into temptation, he will die, and maybe he will be made into a strange undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he does not tempted but stalks quietly, he does not have the ability to get rid of him, things will become extremely troublesome. After all, the knights who follow their own feelings and traces can't compare with the same level of magicians and pastors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic and magical skills, even if they do not necessarily have the same level of blood power attack and defense, can be far superior in mysterious, such as "Astrology and The Book of Elements has a lot of magic to track and detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I have to take the risk of 'destroying'?" Lucien had no idea of ​​waiting for the silence to end. "But the degree of destruction must be mastered. If you completely angered Felipe, it is your own death, and the method of destroying the method is too simple and too superficial. It will also cause suspicion. Only Felipe will be difficult to resolve his 'destruction', and the hard-won winner will end the death feast. It is the best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do, how do I grasp the degree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is getting more and more self-contained feelings. After getting used to the benefits of adventure, he finally gets into a very troublesome scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the experience and lessons to be summarized if you are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lucian’s thought of the “destruction” method, when he had no time to take care of Felipe’s eyes, he could not be the strongest magician in the original Wilfrid territory. Don't bite the scalp and continue to ask Felipe: "Mr. Felipe, because of the contract that the task can't push, go to the Magic Council headquarters, I think it depends on everyone's own wishes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he saw Tess, Sidney and Quentin and other necromancers nod their approval, and Felipe’s mouth showed a sneer, so he quickly added: "Of course, I personally I am willing to follow you to the Magic Council headquarters and join the Pale Hand. But before that, I would like to ask, is it possible to collect the bodies in the country near the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe smiled with satisfaction at the first agree with Sethi: "Mr. Sethi, according to the agreement reached by the Parliament and several kingdoms, you cannot directly destroy the cemetery or kill Get rid of ordinary people to get corpses, you can only rely on money Temptation and other agreements with them to arbitrarily dispose of the body after death. Of course, the bodies you have acquired to kill enemies, magical creatures, beasts, etc. are also your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In this case, our experiment will probably become difficult unless the 'Pale Hand' can provide enough corpses." Sethi frowned and said that the presence of high-level magicians and other places that can go to the alien space is naturally not local. "Human resources", but his mid-level magician who is interested in becoming a big man is very dependent on various rituals to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tess, Quentin and others looked at the magicians and apprentices below, and they all felt similar emotions with their peers. There are no corpses, no dead humans and powerful magical creatures. Those who inherit ancient magic can't see a trace of advancement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing all Necromancers and apprentices become hesitant, seeing Lucien still keep mysterious silence, Felipe is a little annoyed, a little frantically loud道:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can never imagine how the arcane and magic have progressed over the centuries! Just as you can't imagine humans without death, no How to get a pure death and the power of life, how to get the strength of growth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me tell you, since the 'death soul dominates' Vicente? After mulling the mystery of some souls, Lord Miranda has found a way to purify ordinary death and the power of life, no longer need to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the collision of 'spiritual fluctuations' and 'spiritual particle theory' for hundreds of years, one more efficient high-order meditation idea appears one after another, and quickly reduces the requirements. The meditations recorded in your magic book Most of them are out of date!"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet shock of the hall, Felipe continued to speak loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can imagine the thoughts that a high-level magician could learn a hundred years ago. Can the formal magician learn now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you imagine that new magic is born every month?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you imagine a 20-year-old middle-level magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can imagine a 30-year-old high-level "Magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you imagine the 50-year-old Master, the 80-year-old legendary magician?!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only to the mainland Magic Council Headquarters, can you know to what extent the arcane and magic have developed, how vigorous and vital!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe when you spend nearly a hundred years here as a high-level magician, your companion at the Magic Council headquarters is already a Master." The hope is no less than that of being a high-ranking magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Felipe’s almost roaring question, Lucien’s idea of ​​going to the mainland Magic Council headquarters Although I have a lot of knowledge, but there is no channel to transform into power, and in this new era of magical development, no progress means backwardness! Only the fertile soil can grow a towering tree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s eyes madly looked at Lucien with a little provocative look: “You don’t have to worry about being discriminated against at the mainland Magic Council headquarters. Necromancer is currently in addition to The most popular and sought-after magic outside the force field and the electromagnetic system, because it is the magic of studying the mystery of life, the magical transformation between graduate students, and studying various life-extending ways! In comparison, elemental magic is much worse. Although the human body is also composed of elements, but there is no vitality to integrate, only elements can not be practiced (cheng-ren) in any body, whether it is blood, muscle, or all kinds of impurities. Therefore, trying to rely solely on alchemy and elemental magic All studies on life extension have failed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Body refining, life extension, this is the world's source only to open the door to our necromantic magic, no any The magic of the faction can be comparable!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiring the surname’s speech, the Necromancer and the apprentices nodded in the presence, and a strong sense of pride and yearning . According to their knowledge, the human body can only be rectified by human flesh or other living things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Felipe’s words, Lucian suddenly developed an idea. Isn’t the elemental magic here yet in the stage of synthetic organic matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is normal, there is the magic of the dead, human life mechanics must have more powerful, more persuasive results and public opinion atmosphere than the earth, so suppress In this aspect of elemental magic research, but according to Lucien's current understanding, the human body and the soul, vitality are not exactly the same, but in a way that they can not understand. It is certainly impossible to directly refine the living, but it is still possible to refine the material of the group (cheng-ren). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you can try it out from this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the road to the brain, the brain is rapidly turning At the time, Felipe raised his hands and said loudly: "In such a magical era, you can reach the unimaginable wealth of knowledge by joining the pale hands, and the pale hands will also have more arcanes and more due to your participation. The result of magic research. This is a good thing for both parties to benefit from cooperation. Therefore, I propose that everyone sign a magic contract with me, and then I will bring the magician to the headquarters of the parliament. I will leave materials, books and guide for a period of time. Apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and the voice suddenly became slightly mad:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My proposal, who agrees? Who is against?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, the smile of the Necromancer is a kind young man Quentin thought, standing Come out: "Mr. Felipe, I still prefer a free life, not want to be influenced by the organization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is also a gentleman from the Magic Council who may be able to get the way to the Parliament Headquarters from the "Professor" at other affordable prices. And methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
