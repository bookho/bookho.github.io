			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lolta, the capital of the Kingdom of Holm, the six-pointed star platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 7:30 in the morning, Lucien, wearing a formal black bow tie at the neck of a thick white shirt, bragging the cold wind, his hands in a black double-breasted long dress. In the pocket, slowly walk down the magic steam train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the invitation last night, he only had time to verify the elemental will and the correctness of the Holm Royal Magic Court’s magical sign to the school’s management. Busy on the first train to reach Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step out of the magic platform, Lucien waved to stop a carriage, then stepped into the warm carriage and told the coachman to go to Swan Lake Rose Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the driver drives the horses and the wheels roll forward, Lucien calms down and thinks about what he was invited to participate in the "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they value my periodic table of papers, the invitation and treatment should be more grand, after all, it will be an important milestone in the development of elemental magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you don't pay attention, why do they send me an invitation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexplained At 8:30, the carriage stopped in front of the Rose Manor. On the left was a swan lake with a thin layer of ice. It was covered with snow, and the sky was dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gates are guarded at the gate of the manor, and they exude a majestic knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien understands that they are not real knights, but rely on magical potions to have the power of the quasi-knight level, and therefore willingly be a member of the will of the element— - In magic pharmacy, elements, alchemy and necromancers have an absolute advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Arcane Master, can you show me your invitation and arcane badge?" one of the knights asked politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded lightly and handed him the invitation and the arcane badge. The knight verified the Lucy with a mirror-like magic item. After imprinting the name on the Enorm badge and comparing it with the invitation, he warmly returned the badge and invitation to him: "Welcome to you, Mr. Lucien Evans, the arcane masters are almost there. They are in the hall of the main manor house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knight turned and opened the door, and politely reached out and asked Lucien to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No situation occurred, Lucian’s doubts were eliminated a lot, and the roads on the grounds were not rushed to the semi-open manor house. In front of the door, gently push it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low and low voices come from the face, no music, no noisy, no jealousy, the Arcanists gathered in the unusually wide halls in twos and threes. Discussing the recent arcane research, magical trends, and problems encountered in their own research, full of the atmosphere of seeking knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 211 arcane divisions, most of them are middle-level arcans, and a small amount is because of the deep research on an elemental problem. And get a positive low-level arcane master. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a table and a high-backed chair in the hall, and in the center are a half-height metal table with enlarged sound and exposed scenes. The magical array, as well as a semi-human high podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Lucien only caught the attention of a small number of Arcans, but they found that they did not know Lucien and continued to explore each other. Only a pair of cold eyes followed him carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard in the corner responsible for the "Elements and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference" chores, seeing the meeting is about to begin, finally sighed, but suddenly saw himself The famous Lu Xien appeared in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resisted the urge to say hello, his right hand pressed the left side dress without buckle, politely walked through the middle of the arcanes, headed for Lucien go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, how are you here?" Lazar whispered, his expression full of surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien looked at all the strangers, and his heart was a little embarrassed. After seeing the familiar friend of Lazar, he completely settled his heart and shook his invitation: "I don't know why, inexplicably I arrived at this invitation. Lazar, do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invitation?" Lazar was surprised to pick it up, carefully I looked over it and checked the magic signs of the two organizations. Then I looked at Lucien with a monster-like look. "What have you done recently, can you get an invitation? Is it because you wrote it for me? In the letter, I asked me to retest the atomic weight of some of the elements? I measured it with several new methods and found that it was really wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien just answered My own guess, then there was a male voice near the gate asking a female surnamed low-level magician: "Evans, Lucien Evans is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Larry, I have verified it, Mr. Evans was a few minutes ago. Da." The sweet female voice was a little lucky to answer. Fortunately, I checked the arcane division once every five minutes, so that I could answer Mr. Larry’s question in time. Then she turned to the inside of the hall and the sound was enlarged: "Evans Mr. Lucien Evans, please come over, Mr. Larry is looking for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice stops all discussion, Arcanist Looking left and right, I was curious to know this Lucien? Who is Evans and what is the relationship with Mr. Larry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebecca, Mr. Evans is here." Lazar heard his companion looking for his friend, and he felt loudly and replied with a face, then pulled Lu Xien went to the gate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists have let go, and with a little curious look to Lucien, the younger invited Arcane Master? Not like the decadent guy who used magical rituals or potions to extend his life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three men and one woman standing at the door, the green eyes of the woman are bright and bright, wearing a red light dress, delicate and generous, just the brow of her light brown sea Vaguely, I can see a little embarrassment. It seems that this time is very exhausting in preparation for the "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking with her is a round face of a 30-year-old fat man with a yellow rough beard and a pair of deep blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Larry, Mr. Evans is here." Lazar was courteous to the fat man, who had seen the genius of the element. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was about to smile and the opposite Larry was stunned, then blurted out: "Who are you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is loud, even if it is not deliberately loud, it is spread throughout the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Lucien looked at him puzzledly, and Lazar and Rebecca stayed at the same time, and the arcaneists in the hall were strange. I looked over and didn't understand what was going on here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry’s hands pressed: “Sorry, this gentleman, I mean I don’t know you, I’m looking for my student Lucien. Evans, hey, K? Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien probably understands the reason for the matter, and only feels ridiculous in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mr. Larry, only Mr. Evans." Silence for a few seconds, Rebecca is still uneasy and puzzled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry looked at her sideways: "Only this Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the two men who saw the whole thing behind Larry screamed to Rebecca: "Rebecca, the invitation letter is responsible for you to fill out, I let you invite the road because the atomic price paper has been widely praised. Mr. Sean Evans, a disciple of Mr. Larry, is not this, hey, level 1 Arcanist Lucien Evans! What did you do?” He turned his head and glanced at Lucien’s chest. After the arcane and magic badges, the sound is more severe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair is black and wrinkled, the age is not small, the badge of the third-level Arcanist and the three-ring magician on the chest seems to accumulate by time. Arcane level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After relegating Rebecca, he apologized to the side of the white-haired old man with a slightly curved nose and suit, and continued to glare at Rebecca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Leandre, because Douglas Magic School has two roads, Sean Evans, so they may have made a mistake." All eyes stunned, Lazar's face turned slightly red, but could not help but defend Rebecca. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandre is even more angry: "In this case, don't you mark K on the invitation letter or the level of the Arcane, the level of magic? He is only one level. ! Like you!" He pointed to Lucien's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but Mr. Leandre, I checked all the people at Douglas Magic School, only one Mr. Lucien Evans." Rebecca Tears turn straight, if there is the same name with the same name, she will definitely mark the difference between the letters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calmly explained: "Mr. Leandre, K left before you sent out the invitation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning is that the person who made the mistake is the person who told Rebecca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandre’s anger is unstoppable: “But even so, she’s not marked with a high level of arcaneism! It’s a big mistake! And why don’t you measure whether you are eligible to participate? 'Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference', you can't think about it with the brain, is this an invitation for you?" Because of Lucien's low level, he is like a blame for his subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, no, it’s my fault." Larry raised his hands. "I let K leave, but I can temporarily decide to invite K. Forgot to explain this to Mr. Leandro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Larry, why don't you invite K yourself?" The old man with white hair was slightly darker. Weird eyes look at Larry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry smiled bitterly: "Teacher, I didn't expect K to finish leaving so quickly, thinking that he should stay in school for the next few days. The result didn't know where to go, and couldn't find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black suit, the pupil with a bit strange look is actually the teacher of Larry. The director of the elemental will, the member of the Arcane Review Committee, the seventh-level arcane master, and the seven-ring magician Gaston. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before and after explaining a contrast, the arcane masters in the hall basically understood what was going on, and they whispered and thought it was a rare and interesting thing. From time to time, someone makes a low laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gaston, we are not rigorous and cause trouble for you." Rean Drew apologized to Gasthon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdong's gentle jaw: "Everyone has a mistake, you don't have to be too harsh on this little girl."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandro looked up and sternly said to Rebecca: "Since Mr. Gaston said this, I will not submit the mistake you made this time, and you can't commit it again later."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he turned his head and said to Lucien: "There is nothing with you here, you can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Such an attitude, even if Lucian is so good at keeping calm and rational magicians will inevitably raise a strong sense of shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gaston raised his hand to stop Leandro from speaking: "Evans, do you have the arcane in the field of elemental learning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Gaston." Lucien didn't understand what he meant, but saw his attitude and embarrassment, so he nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon smiled and said: "Then you stay here to listen. Since you are here, don't miss it. This is the meeting of the latest research in the field of elements. Maybe you can't understand too much, but the help for you will be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Lu Xien silently hesitating, hehe said: "Young people, Don't be shy, wait until you become a famous arcane master. Today's event is a beautiful talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing is the latest research result, so I am eager to learn Lucian slowly nodded and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold eyes watched this scene, but Gaston and Larry didn’t say anything more, and they quickly passed by Lucien. Go to the center of the hall. So he quickly opened his eyes and was afraid of being seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
