			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of Calais, Cox, within the House of Nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These promises will be included in the Code, and it is clearly stated that I and the future kings and queens will abide by it, no different from the general aristocracy! Supervised realization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Natasha’s passionate and infectious words, all the nobles were not calm, but suddenly, bang With a loud bang, there is only the noisy current sound of Zizz in the "live broadcast" alchemy items, and there is no signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Neksee Palace destroyed by the aftermath of the legendary battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it church or parliament?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Song of Dusk" Youssner is looking northwest in amazement, that is the location of Rentart City, the instinct of the epic knight makes him There was a phantom, and there seemed to be a round of incandescent sea that radiated endless light, and then a mushroom with a big neck and a small neck rose, indicating its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the president of the Silver Moon League, the sorcerer Joaquin appeared at the door, his face was an uncontrollable joy, and announced: "Electromagnetic signal is disordered, which means that our 'eternal blazing yang' succeeded in blasting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing yang?" Youssner confided to himself In a sentence, this power of legendary magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that under the current situation, if Akin can't know more, all the communication from Rantart should have been interrupted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Akinxin’s self-confident attitude infects the nobility, and then recalls Natasha’s speech before, all of them are in awe-inspiring mood, as if there is a flame burning Their eyes were divided into two directions, some looking at the Grand Duke of Calais, and some praying to see Youssner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yousnar gave a sigh of relief, no longer hesitating, and went to the front of the Grand Paley to kneel on one knee:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old era is over, the new era is over, the new era is coming, please order the expulsion of the radical Southern Church, and only retain the moderate sect as the state religion!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the leader, all the nobles left, one knee::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grand Duke, please order, welcome the new The times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds merged into one, echoing in the hall of the House, as if the wave of rolling forward, who would dare to block who will be completely submerged, become old The burial of the times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Calais collected a bitter smile. When the shackles of the old times were broken, all the order of the past will be reorganized. At this time, the trend of the times will continue. It is the king, the Grand Duke, who violates the will of all nobles. It will be the running dog of the collusion and must be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All rights are based on strong power and strict order, and their family has no epic knights. When this old order is washed, the only thing All I have to do is stand up and announce loudly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, the contemporary Grand Duke of Calais, ordered the expulsion of the Southern Church, retaining the moderate sect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear to the Lord of Hell with soul and destiny, and will return the rights to everyone like Holm Kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Yousnar and all the nobles smiled:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear to follow the Grand Duke!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of Buriana, Salivar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hammer of the Void" Bedrenka and the "Knight of the Disaster" Bassol took a member of the House of All Aristocrats in front of the King of Burriana Your Majesty:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Colette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life Reaper" is a "brown" with a light brown hair, often with a warm and cheerful smile on his face, but at this time, his smile converges With the nobles, kneel in front of King Colette: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King, the coming of the new era is unstoppable, we must be ready to meet it, please You will be ordered to assist the Magic Council as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Coastal Corridor, City The capital of the Union, Keswick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Burning Lady" herself is the lord of Ksvik, but she is equally excited about Natasha’s final speech, because it gave her inspiration and let her find With the idea of ​​bringing the loose city alliance closer together, plus the information returned from Burriana, Colette, and Calais, she rose up like a red rose and announced to other nobles in the House:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have smelled the new era, so I will assist the Magic Council and transform the form of the City Alliance. Are you against it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles smiled inexplicably: "Everything obeys the instructions of the lord of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would dare to oppose this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the order of the Grand Duke of Calais, the "Song of Dusk" immediately rose. The "Transformation Master" Elika and "Wisdom Angel" Terence, who fought against the heights outside the city, flew away and planned to cast a stern to build a feat for the new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he has not yet flown to the vicinity, "Wisdom Angel" Terence has just evaded the "Rainbow Dragon" spit, exerting magic to get rid of the lock The chaos is sent away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did he know that I was coming to kill him, not to help him?" Youssner was a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika changed back to human form, see Yousnar did not do it, suddenly understood his decision, smiled and said: "I also want to run, this kind of Any closeness in the situation must be vigilant, and it is the same to return after confirming the position after hiding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is not worried about being attacked by the "Song of Dusk", she is sure Entangled with Terence for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yousnar is awakening, for Terence, whether you are a friend or an enemy, escape is the best choice, and you can’t wait for yourself and Ai Rika fought and he touched back and attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time to act, I will guard Calais, not to destroy Terence, and you will jump to Rantat." Youssner Erica said that although he personally went to Rantat to be more symbolic, the Magic Council will certainly have doubts, fearing that he is a swindler for the church, secretly distracting himself, but reducing his combat power, but Elika only needs to return. Appeared in front of the legendary magician and the cardinal, they immediately understood their decision. After all, the transmission array of the Cox to the holy city of Lance was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika did not hesitate to guard the U.S. sneak attack "space jump" to leave, under the energy storm, directly return to Alin through the transmission array It is not safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the coastal corridor of the North, the cardinal also slipped away quickly, and Enlight of Colette was unlucky. "The soul of the dead", even if the "life reaper" appeared, Vicente distracted and allowed him to escape in a short time, was attacked by two legends, and finally had to take the opportunity to escape with the cost of serious injuries, but In this way, the legendary second-order he permanently reduced to the first-order, and it is more difficult to upgrade again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dazzling to the eye-catching light flashed, Oliver, Helen, Hathaway did not hesitate to fly away from the central area, to the speed of the legendary field to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the magical blockade of space jumps, chaotic transmissions, etc., they didn’t need to be so embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other legendary magicians did not entangle the thoughts of the members of the cardinal group in front of them. Although they all have the means of life-saving, but they want to recover, how can it take a few hours, if all are the same, the pope, the king of angels, the church follow-up The members of the Cardinal Mission, the coming blazing angels, etc., can calmly entangle Douglas and Brooke, sweep out Allinge, destroy the resurrection means reserved by them, and the members of the Cardinal Mission in the center of the explosion are very large. It may be just a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sun that lifts the color of everyone’s eyes rises, and then a strange mushroom grows slowly, and the head is terrible and makes people feel guilty. It is full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Light Ocean violently oscillated, and it was swept away in a short time. The "land of heaven" began to collapse, broken like glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of his own as the fulcrum to open the "land of heaven" Mecan Tron, thirty-six wings immediately dim, spurting a thick golden blood, in Energy storms and horror swayed like leaves in high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity for Douglas to distract from the power of the "eternal blaze" explosion, Mecantelon finally found the opportunity, hands crossed, squatting, whispering Read:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where you are named, you are not harmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not belong to this The ripples and blurring colors of the world quickly emerged from Mekantron, targeting the super-large transmission array below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the heavens on the earth are completely split, and the power of "eternal blaze" rolls over to various places in Rentat, and turtles appear on the periphery of the super large transmission array. The crack on the back is completely destroyed, but it is blocked by the "guardian of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Mecan Tron was also uncomfortable, and once again spewed out the golden blood, the strength and breath were significantly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual energy storm after breaking the "land of heaven" continues to wreak havoc, and the enchantment of the complete opening of Lucien is also fragmented, crumbling, and finally slowing down. Slowly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west of Rantat is almost not damaged, but the aristocratic area that covers a very large area in the east is almost flattened. Escape, or go to the west of the city, or go to Nexel Palace, I am afraid there will be serious casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the core defensive layer, Nexel Palace finally blocked the aftermath of the "eternal blaze", a nobleman looked out The scene is painful, villas, treasures, collections, all gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the core of the explosion is scattered, the "Sacred Avengers" Melmos looks like a wolf, and the legendary armor on his body is only embedded in the debris. On the body, half of the body is vaporized, and the breath is steeply dropped. Fortunately, the long sword in the right hand is only seriously damaged and not destroyed. The strength is seriously injured, leaving only the level of the legendary peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still good, the two people behind him are hurt even more, Anasta and Maria seize the time to treat themselves, their The power of faith seems to have a feeling of exhaustion, and the strength has regressed a step, but fortunately, Melmos blocked the front, not permanently reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Melmos is a little farther away, Anthony and Augusta, who are far worse than Anasta, have evaporated from the world. Even a trace of the remaining remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two Saints!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos sees such a result, The eyes are red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt, looked up at the sky, and saw the slower, more old Benedict II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is finally back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, Hathaway and other arcanists The legendary magician, the pupil shrinks slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of joy has just emerged, he noticed a series of explosions in the city of Rentat, twenty cardinals, over one hundred bishops, thousands The priest and the body of the same number of angels blew open, as if it was caused by the broken "land of heaven". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
