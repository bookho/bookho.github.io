			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The singing of the nightingale goes through the secluded grove and gently drifts away to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the serenade of the poet's tenderness, Lucien left the bar and slowly walked over to the three adventurers to sit down and scared the linen-haired half-elf girl who was immersed in the music. The back is sharp and straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear guests, you want to hire us?" Mature and beautiful half-elf lady gently patted the wine table in front of him and asked with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she, like other adventurers, thinks that Lucien is a poisonous young man who was poisoned by the knight’s novel, with a faint banter in his smile, but on the surface It is very polite, because this kind of teenager has always been a big choice, and is one of the best choices for employers. No one will hate Kintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded in no hurry: "I am going to Coser City, don't know if the three are willing to accept employment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Half Elf seems to be responsible for communicating with the employer. She smiles and points to herself and the next two: "I am Joanna, two-handed sword warrior, high-order The knight is a strong man. This is my husband, the sword shield warrior Simon, also has the level of high-ranking knight attendants. This is my sister Betty, an excellent archer, no worse than us. So, respected guests, you have to hire We are not cheap. Of course, our reputation has always been good. Unlike some guys whose employers always like to disappear, you can ask Uncle Hansen about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Hansen is the owner of the pub, the head of the local adventurer guild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna did not depress her voice. For a while, some of the adventurers and mercenaries in the pub became very bad, but Simon and the three of them The strength is obvious to the locals, and the team is very reasonable. Unless it is the knight's rank, the adventurers who have at least three times more will dare to attack their ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to Coser City? That’s great. I heard that a talented musician from the Principality, Bert, is going to Kosher City to hold a concert. Find a chance to go back.” Lu Xien still did not answer, half-elf girl Betty was very happy to squat up, causing her sister to look at her sideways, this little adult still can't understand The situation is now a crucial time for bargaining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With limited conditions, music that can be spread by bards is a common form of entertainment common to ordinary people in the world, other circuses, operas, etc. All need special time. This is also why musicians are widely welcomed, although they do not give musicians any benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty was stunned by her sister’s beautiful eyes before she knew that she had made a mistake, quietly spit out her tongue and closed her mouth, but she looked at Lu Xi’s linen. The blue eyes are full of expectation, and the half-length ears sway slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how much you need to pay?" Lucien didn't care to ask, although it was a lot of money on the road because of food and so on. Ten Jintales, there are still eighty-five. Besides, it is really short of money. Looking for a big city to hold a concert can be re-rich. This is the benefit of becoming a famous musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啧, Sure enough, the rich aristocratic young master, Joanna’s eyes sighed slightly, while she sighed and thought about what the price would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is a Yinnar one day." Seeing his wife hesitating, the short brown hair, the strong and strong Simon smiled and answered her instead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna couldn’t help but glance at her husband and ask him with his eyes, how is it peaceful? Are you as stupid as Betty? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon hangs the shield and the long sword on the small tick behind the leather armor: "I don't want to ruin the credibility that we have built up for years. This is OK. Yes, the only requirement for a respected guest is to pay daily, and give it to me directly. Don’t give it to Betty. She doesn’t know how to cherish money. We have to help her pick it up and wait for it later. Go to Kuse City for regular knight training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the south-central countries of the continent, the fallen aristocrats are not as decent as Aalto, so they are free to train themselves. The knightly loyal knight training has become a way to make money. Of course, this also gives ordinary people more opportunities. After all, in the northern countries of Aalto, ordinary people want to carry out regular knight training, only through the Cavaliers' assessment, the role of money is very small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien saw that their price was only half that of Aalto's peers, so he pointed to the bar: "We will sign the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adventurers' Guild Guarantee, the probability of a problem will be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bar, Lucien handed the identity document and supporting documents to the pub owner Hansen, letting him identify the truth and draft the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy to serve you, distinguished guests." Hansen said, smiling and taking two documents, but he took a serious look, the expression immediately changed It’s weird, but he’s not too young, he has a rich life experience, and he quickly resists the surprise and doesn’t attract anyone’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hansen buried his head, carefully read it several times, then checked the magic mark, then smiled more politely: "Your identity file is no problem, I I will draft the contract for you right away, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a little excitement, from the excitement that can show off to the grandchildren in the future: "Hey, Grandpa, my The pub has come to a big man, that is the famous musician of the whole continent, Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract is quickly prepared, the two sides have seen no problem Later, Lucien took the lead in signing his name and stamping it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna took the contract and prepaid the three Yinar, looked at the seal, and then stamped his handprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a generous gentleman. Right, can you call Mr. Evans directly?" Joanna asked with a smile and politely, her family illiterate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty sees the contract signed down, smiles Splendidly said: "You are also Mr. Evans? Oh, and Alto's talented musician Lucian Evans has the same surname, he is my favorite musician, talented and young and handsome! I heard that he is traveling around the mainland. I don’t know if I will come to Djibouti.” I look forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can a big musician come to a remote and poor country like Djibouti." Joanna broke her sister's fantasies and educated her without losing her time. If you can train your blood after the regular knight training, you can apply to join the Violet Knights. At that time, our family will move to Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi I smiled and asked: "Miss Betty, how do you know Lucien? Mr. Evans is young and handsome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bard talks like this." Betty After a little disappointment, re-energize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Outside the Dragon Teeth Tavern, Lucien is preparing to take the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, wait!" A young man walked quickly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is in his twenties, wearing a white flowing robes, a long blond hair and blue eyes, a neat appearance, a faint smile on his lips: "Hello Mr. Evans, I heard that you are going to Coser City, I can join the team. I am willing to pay one-third of the reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the price of hiring adventurers and mercenaries is not cheap, many people choose to join other people's teams. So only pay part of the reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. You don't look like you are missing money, why don't you hire yourself?" Lucien also accepted many similarities during the three-month trip. Traveler, his eyes become sinister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna, Simon, and Betty did not insert conversations because they would not earn more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man replied indifferently: "The pub owner Hansen told me that Simon has the best reputation and the strongest strength, and other adventurers are rude and rude, so I I want to join Mr. Evans in your team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing in Coser City?" Lucien asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men come up with their identity documents: "I went to the musician association in Coser City, hey, learn music." Moderate and restrained appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
