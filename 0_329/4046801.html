Benedict III looked at the opposite Cardinal and repeated the news he had reported, apparently a bit incomprehensible. The degree of intelligence can also be sent to myself. If even the pea-sized things are handled by themselves, how many more red cardinals do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to feel the unpleasant emotions of Benedict III. The cardinal’s forehead has a cold sweat, and he is less nervous than he is nervous. One sentence: "Responding to His Majesty the Pope, this live broadcast is not the live broadcast of the Alto Music Festival in the Municipal Square, but the live broadcast of some cities across the Straits and the North Coastal Corridor. This allows the number of people watching the Rantart Festival to Millions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Super-remote image transmission... With the help of artificial planet?" Benedict III naturally understands that the live broadcast of the Cardinal is not only sound. Broadcasting, so he knew about arcanes. He first thought of artificial planets. Only they can afford similar demands. Unless the Magic Council holds the determination to go bankrupt, it arranges sound and image transmission arrays everywhere, just like the church in the past. Do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal bowed his head: "Yes, according to the information of the night watchman, the Magic Council did use the artificial planet as a transit station."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-level magician who arranged the "curtain" made the "artificial planet" shine to varying degrees in the final debugging, and sprinkled the ray of light, creating a strange sight - At the level of their strength, this is something that cannot be avoided. Therefore, the night watchman with basic magical common sense judges that this "music festival live broadcast" is based on the "artificial planet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben’s face became condensed and took emergency information from the Cardinal. Read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope, although the 'live' magical array is not constant, nor is it an alchemy item, it loses its effect after several uses. But This way will certainly be gradually determined by the Magic Council, and this will cause the sway of the believers in the four countries of the Straits and the North Coastal Corridor, which is not conducive to our counterattack in the future.” The Cardinal worried about the development of the church, boldly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III put down the information, the look on his face is deep and sealess, making people unable to judge his true thoughts: "It is only the wavering of the believers? Rantart The music festival held live at the same time in different cities at different distances, with sound, video, and even ordinary people can enjoy rather than only the big nobility... There are many things hidden behind such things, absolutely It’s not just a simple wave of people who can be summed up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m stupid. I can’t understand the Lord’s prompt.” The Cardinal scared his body and shivered. I still want to get the appreciation of His Majesty the Pope. It was affected by this greed, and the result was not open when it was not open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benius III slightly decapitated and continued: "Of course. For us, the most important influence is indeed the shake of the believers, the magicians use enjoyment, luxury The indulgence and the lizard-like multicolored world seduce people to fall, so that they are no longer as simple as they were hundreds of years ago, lost their hearts, and let the world become sloppy, but the more they do, the more we need to uphold the teachings of the Lord and save each There is a little kind of glorious lamb in the depths of his heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a difficult and dangerous road, every cleric must do a good job Preparation. Are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal is affirmed, and his heart is excited, and he crosses the cross on his chest: "On the truth forever!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Communicate my order and hold an emergency meeting of the Cardinal Mission." Benedict III pityed mercifully and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, in addition to temporarily going out, unable to receive news and guarding important areas, people who are difficult to pull out at the moment, the other cardinal members gathered in Daguangming Hall Good-looking novel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before Pope Benedict III took the Platinum Scepter out, they had already learned the theme of the meeting from the Cardinal’s notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope, the artificial planet is extremely harmful, we must concentrate on destroying them completely, and we can no longer counter and seek opportunities as before." The head of the Knights of the Knights, Melmos, made a straightforward proposal. Although he did not study arcanes like the cardinal, from the perspective of the onlookers, he could see the artificial planet more on the Lord, the church, and the faith. Hazard, their operation in the sky seems to make the magicians have a pair of "eyes of God", a pair of "bright wings"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Mary is a quiet-haired brown-haired girl, but her age is at least three hundred years old. At this time, her voice is soft and soft: "For the Magic Council, the manufacture and launch of the artificial planet is not very Difficult things, even if we concentrate on killing one, they will be able to fire a few more in a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, now the magic In addition to the absence of a god, the overall strength of the parliament is almost the same as that of us. We can concentrate on attacking. Can we not concentrate on counterattack? Can we still withstand the consumption of this all-out war? The evils of the north, the evil creatures of the dark mountains Looking at us, waiting for us to make mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Angel of the Wind" Estila said in the words of Maria: "The Magic Council is open this time. The large-scale live broadcast of Lucien Evans’s Valkyrie, wouldn’t we expect our reaction? Perhaps this is another trap for them, maybe they are waiting for us to concentrate on destroying the orbiting planet!”<br / ><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? Can you launch similar items and use our 'eye of the eye' against the magician's 'artificial planet'?" "The Light of God" Beria has this for them. The difficulty of the difficult word is not very satisfactory, always make feasible suggestions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new cardinal Philip said: "Directly making similar items is not our strength, but we can find a way to capture a man-made planet. Divine patterns and magic The pattern is not very different in nature, but the power of the last borrowing is completely different. As long as it takes time, we should be able to imitate it, and at that time, we can get the Lord's gift. The manufactured goods will be richer in the orbit than the artificial planet. Attack and creativity!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In borrowing power, past experience shows that magic is more convenient than magic, because “God” is everywhere, even if it is Above the orbit, unlike the magician, in addition to using his own spiritual spells, with the help of gravity and solar heat, you need a constant magic array or the entire magic tower to assist, and this makes the artificial planet's attack power obviously insufficient - If the artificial planet is made into an item close to the legendary level, the cost is too high. It is difficult to reflect the quantitative advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. The Magic Council paid so much attention to fission reactors and planned controlled nuclear fusion. If they can be miniaturized, it will completely flatten the gap between magic and magic in this respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This requires a complete and safe plan and cannot fall into the trap of the Magic Council." Melmos acknowledged Philip's opinion. Instead, attitudes become cautious and less radical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, everyone shows their devotion to the Lord." Benedict III made the final decision, let Mary, Melmos, Members of the cardinal group such as 腓力 developed plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Cardinal Ines painted the cross and added: "But we can't relax the destruction of the artificial planet, or else the Magic Council will launch a few times a year. One day, the whole blue sky will be covered by the artificial planet, and the sun will never be seen again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this idea is very funny, but each The cardinal members of the cardinal group could not help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In St. Ivan, Pope Bilkovsky And the Emperor Romanov of the Shahran Empire received news of their respective intelligence personnel, and then. At about the same time, they lifted their heads and looked out at the blue sky outside the window. It seemed to see the artificial planet through the blue sky and the white clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt about the strategic significance of the artificial planet, but at the same time sighed, because there is no way to create, want to capture one and worry about falling into the magic The trap of the parliament, and there is no way for him to confront the magic parliament while facing the oppression of the southern church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you must wait patiently for the opportunity, as long as you capture one without causing a large-scale battle, the Magic Council can only recognize the teeth. Because they are equally unlikely to rashly attack themselves and other forces when they are fully confronted with the Southern Church, it will make the Southern Church ecstatic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark mountains, a flamboyant castle stands on the edge of the cliff, mostly made of gold, enough to attract the saliva of the dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seductive man with a cigar leaned back on the high back chair and looked at the housekeeper in front of him: "You are very interesting, if The live parcel of the Magic Council can be smaller, so I can see all kinds of interesting things in the castle, which is really a good thing for my lazy family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
