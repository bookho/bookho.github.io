			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the blazing month (August), the Rantat civilian area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the parents went to the seafood company and the Crystal Light Workshop, Langman was alone at home to look at the books purchased during this time, and he was silent. Thank God for the truth, thank the arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the evil radical church was expelled by the Magic Council, the moderates came to power, and the expensive books were much cheaper, even the children of their own civilians. I can also buy one or two books every few months with the support of my parents. This is a luxury that I couldn’t imagine in the past, and I feel that the love of books is like a bright and gentle sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman knows from the Voice of Mystery that in fact, paper was born hundreds of years ago. After a long period of improvement, the price has dropped to a copper. Nal can buy a large stack, and the printing technology is the same. It can radically send churches to monopolize knowledge, monopolize channels of communication with the master, artificially block printing technology, encourage manuscripts, and make books long-term The price of Gu is not only aristocrats and big businessmen. It is very difficult for ordinary people to learn words and knowledge. Fortunately, there is a secret communication in the Magic Council. The average knowledge level of Rentat has reached the qualified standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the times have changed, and knowledge is precious, but it does not exceed the necessary limits, because the alchemists and the great aristocrats urgently need workers with knowledge bases. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking over the book, this is a book about the common creatures in nature, and comes with lifelike illustrations, so that Langman, who followed his father to understand some of the text, also read To be relished - his father climbed from the ground up and received the teaching of words and fisheries knowledge after becoming a middle-level supervisor of the seafood company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gourman, Kobold, Goblin, Giant, Barbarian, Dudou..." Looking at the book, Langman seemed to be in the dark. In nature, I saw a creature with a different appearance. They have similarities and different characteristics. It makes people feel drunk. "It is really worth it to buy this book for several months!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, knocking on the door, let Langman awake from the ocean of knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" he asked aloud, his back was quite straight, and his heart was suddenly nervous. I was a child at home, if it was a robber, a thief, Or the cruel "watchman" of the "Sound of Mystery"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, there is a sound in the door: "Open the door, I am the kingdom." Postman's postman, have your letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Langman immediately sighed and secretly laughed at the horror story in "The Voice of Mystery". Even during the day, I was scared. The robbers, thieves, and night watchers didn’t all come out at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Langman saw a smiling and sly young man wearing a dark green costume, carrying a heavy package with a look, holding two in his hand Letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your letter." The postman said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman took the letter and first saw the exquisite stamp on the envelope, which was the first batch issued by the Kingdom, which was printed by Her Majesty and Evans. Your avatar represents a different amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stamp is so beautiful, you have to cut it down..." Langman thought subconsciously, then looked at the sender and found himself married to Pefus County. My aunt wrote it, and my heart was filled with joy. My aunt loved her most before she got married, but her uncle was in the capital of Pefus County. Although it was not far from Renta, it was just a few hours drive from the magic steam train, but communication was difficult. It is not so easy to find a friend or businessman who is willing to bring a letter and is reliable, and the price is quite expensive. Only one letter arrives back and forth in a year, almost losing contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, everything is different, Langman looked at the value of the stamps he posted, and found that he could take up one month’s communication with his own pocket money. situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, thank you, Her Majesty, thank you, Lord Evans, thank Prime Minister Russell, thank the Kingdom Post Department, he painted the cross on his chest, and then looked at the second Letter, the eyes suddenly became big: "Admission Notice? Rantat First General School?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? what! I was accepted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the pilot was just started, the royal family and the Magic Council have only jointly established two general schools in Renttat, which are named after the first and second simple rules. Therefore, in the case that many civilians can afford tuition, they want to There are many people who want to enter these two schools. There may not be a lucky one among the 100 people. Fortunately, under Her Majesty, she has established a fair admission method, “unified entrance examination”, so that she has room to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can really learn the knowledge, you can really understand the arcane and magic common sense..." Langman stood still, with countless thoughts in his mind Rolling, it’s not calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please sign and verify, you can click on the fingerprint if you don't write." The postman sent a lot of such "admission notices" today and is used to this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman came back and took the fountain pen in the hands of the postman - this is said to be popularized to the public, written on the receipt I have my own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, uncle, you have brought me great joy." Langman thanked him since he returned the fountain pen to the postman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman laughed and said: "Feel your happiness, I feel very good, wait for enough money, I also want to go to the general school to study, after Maybe we are alumni."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman’s face is red and screaming: “May the Lord bless your wish to come true, uncle, are you tired of doing the postman every day? There are a lot of letter parcels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman smiled and said: "It’s very tired, but it won’t take long. It’s said to give us a name. Bicycle stuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bicycle?" Langman frowned with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sending the postman away, he couldn’t wait to open the offer letter, take out his father’s dictionary, and read the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"General language, mathematical foundation, historical overview, natural introduction, magic common sense, logical basis, heraldic identification, basic arcane, body tempering... these are Basic general education, which is compulsory; music, fencing, painting, writing, electromagnetic preliminary, element summary, psychological common sense, medical foundation, advanced mathematics, mantra and semiotics, ancient magic language, political science, economics... It is an elective course. After the third year of general education, according to your own situation, you can choose the basic knowledge in different directions.” Langman read the course content and carefully looked at their introductions, and his heart could hardly contain his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a clerk, politician, or musician, painter, knight attendant, doctor, arcane master..." Langman knows that his magical talent is not counted. Ok, like ordinary people, so the arcane division is ranked last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the sky darkened and his parents returned home and saw the offer letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman’s father nodded after reading the acceptance letter: “Now think about it, it’s still very early, and when you really start learning, you know what you’re good at. What are you not good at? Of course, I suggest that you start studying aristocratic etiquette, horseback riding, fencing, economics, music, and fishery knowledge in the fourth year. After entering the seafood company, you can quickly become a supervisor with this knowledge and connect with nobles and big businessmen. We, as for magic, how is your talent, you know very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally hopes that his son will grow up under his own blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman’s mother did not agree: “The current trend is the development of alchemy workshops. Langman should learn more magic even if his magical talents are not good. The knowledge of alchemy, in the future will become the head of the alchemy workshop, more than the seafood company."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have had a heated discussion on this issue until The Voice of Mystery begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman, who has been silent, sat in the square, listening to the contents of the "Unveiled Church", his heart was messy, some excitement, and some lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... After exploring the world of the dead, several legendary magicians confirmed the existence of the Mountain of Heaven and had reason to believe that the God of truth has fallen into a deep sleep The authority was stolen by the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Speaking of the Pope, he has to mention his true identity. He is actually a bloody and cruel ancient wizard of the Mage. Ken, mixed into the ranks of the Truth, and the God of Truth took power during the sleep period..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
