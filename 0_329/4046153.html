			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of Karen Erdia has a smile on Lu Xien, and the handsome corner of his mouth is raised: "Mr. Professor, you have a young body." Vitality, I don't feel wrong. Oh, from the definition of arcane established by Mr. Douglas, the magic parliament is as full of vitality and vitality as a young man, so that one young and one young person can be seen. "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Junmei’s viscount Karel Diad, inside the heart: "The legend of the local popular vampire and black magician, this Can you feel the vitality of others, is it a vampire strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, Lucien smiled calmly and answered: "Facts I have not heard of Mr. Felipe, and I am looking forward to meeting him, but I do have a lot of things to deal with, and I can only leave this wonderful party to the feast.” Felipe told Professor "The attitude is good or bad, it is difficult to determine, Lucien prefers to go to the death feast." Determine the identity of the city of Stuttgart Turk liaison from his words and commitments to other magician's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a pity. Mr. Professor, this is your invitation." Viscount Kareldia took the letter from the Ned Butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording on the invitation is exactly the same as that of Hunter and the magic apprentice, but the mark becomes a tall black hat, and Lucien looks at it casually. In the pocket of income, then smiled and got up: "I sincerely thank the Viscount. I will not bother your rest, just say goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I It’s just a wonderful day.” Viscount Kareldia helped the forehead. “If you are a professor, you are willing to stay and exchange. It’s a pity. I’m not convenient to leave you, I wish you a smooth life under the silver moon. Return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nide Butler led Lunian to leave the old castle and return to the study. The old-fashioned face was slightly puzzled: "Master, why should you let him participate?" Death feast? Can you really confirm the identity of the professor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia went to the window and looked at the dreamy lake at night, laughing Road: "Of course, Nieder, you didn't see the ring worn by Mr. Professor's left index finger. Although it is damaged, I can't see the original appearance. The words engraved on it are deliberately obscured by Professor, but the unique seven-element alloy is only owned by Holm Royal Demon Court and 'Elemental Will'. It seems to be the will of the two organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nide Butler is even more surprised: "Master, why do you still let him participate in the death feast?" The elemental will and the pale hand are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not very interesting? And he seems to have a familiar taste..." Karen Viscount Diad smiled and interrupted the Nieder stewardship, and at the same time frowned slightly with a puzzled look, then his voice became serious. "Amorecuk, how does the professor feel the unique magic?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dull, resounding voice appears out of thin air: "It seems to be a sound of sound waves, relying on feedback to constantly adjust the frequency, and this frequency is very special, Made me a little itchy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............Relying on Natasha's rid of the tracking method, Lucien spent half an hour before returning to the castle of Baron Habero, and then successfully smashed with a magical "light of darkness" Simon who passed the vigil enters his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the "light of darkness" is to create a special dark area where people inside can clearly see things outside, but outsiders But can't see through the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in bed, Lucien put the "谟" ring away and hid it, then the fingertips came out with a small flame to burn Hunt's invitation, then quiet Waiting for half an hour, I found that no one was tracking it until I took time to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, just used breakfast, under the strong request of Wise and Mars, the adventurer squad returned to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sat next to the window, from time to time to teach Betty regular Cavaliers training in the alert and the way to hurry. These methods come from John's remarks and Natasha's occasional pointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious and boring knight training makes Betty, Joanna, and Simon, who are first contacted, a bit unbearable, but think of the horrible non-humanoid necromancer, think of Mr. Evans’s powerful and enviable strength, they insisted on sticking their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon said to Lu Xien with a sigh of relief: "When the church is reported, the knight with many heroic deeds will become the embodiment of the fallen, which is a very regrettable ending."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, but what makes me even more regretful is the life of innocent death." Lucien is not familiar with the story of Baron Habero, it is difficult to appreciate the mood of Simon and Joanna. However, before the death of Baron Habero, the pain and remorse of helplessness and old age, or let Lucien have a lot of feelings, must be young as early as a high-level magician, otherwise wait until the old, memory and mental decline, only I can watch my skin dry up and watch the wrinkles appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Three hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church confession room, the third-level bishop Arnold carefully examined the identity documents and supporting documents in his hand, and then smiled: "I can’t think of the talented musician Lucien Evans. It turned out to be a powerful knight, which really surprised me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he had let Lucien play the "Sorrow" with the piano in the church That is completely beyond the level of ordinary musicians to convince him, and now there is no doubt after verifying the documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "I relied on the gift of the princess of the princess to inspire the blood, just a quasi-knight, or else I have long been Be enshrined as a lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, if it weren’t for this reason, it would be glory to mention genius musicians and genius knights together, no It is necessary to be secret. This time, the defeat of the fallen Baron Habero and the Necromancer is based on the extraordinary weapons and objects given by His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nata The generosity of His Royal Highness Princess Shakespeare makes everyone stunned.” Arnold’s eyes replied intricately, two magical items, one magical item, two extraordinary weapons, which are comparable to the collection of Viscount Stanley. It seems that the talented musician Lucien Evans is right about the secret lover of His Royal Highness Princess Natasha of the Vauritan Principality. He thought to himself, "Why can't I have such a good thing, I am rumored that Princess Natasha is still a beautiful woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hours ago, After hearing the report of Lu Xien and others, the pastor of the Wolf Town Trainee was scared to be cold and sweaty, and quickly returned to the Cathedral of Korse with the birds in the church. Two hours later, Bishop Arnold flew over with two priests and four night watchmen with the sacred items, and then asked Lu Xien, Simon, etc., while letting the night watchman rush to the Baron of Habero to investigate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Lucien has already told about what happened in the castle several times. Bishop Arnold did not hear any flaws, and it also confirmed the interrogation of Simon and Betty. , Joanna and others obtained the record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he did not have much doubt after he knew Lu Xi’s identity. If Lu Xi’an had problems, he had already sneaked into the mountains to escape. Why bother to report to the church? Just figure out how he killed the Baron Habero and the Necromancer, and he can organize the report into the Cardinal responsible for the Djibouti Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold’s eyes began to make a final verification: “Mr. Evans, can you show me the items you killed the fallen lord and the Necromancer?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Lucien seems to care less and answer his hand, extending his left hand. "This is a ring that can launch a cold blade. This is capable." Use the flame shield and fireball bracelet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snow Avenger Ring and the Weavers Bracelet have been treated with a special stained plant by Lucien Appearance, able to maintain a change in the day, so as not to be recognized by the church, and the Yangyan body is deliberately said to be a flame shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lucien did not remove the magical items, Arnold did not force it, using a similar spiritual power to sense the magical energy contained in it. After Lucien’s words, he saw Lucien unbuttoning his tongue, revealing the talisman of the chest. “<之冕.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the early period of the Twilight War. Style..." Arnold is familiar with the church's logo, "Only the ancient aristocrats like the Violet family still retain similar items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien A slight glimpse of the suspicion of the relationship between Maskillin and the church, but the current scenes and timing are not suitable for exploring this matter, only to suppress the doubts, take the vigilant sword and the decapitated dagger: "a handful It is a long sword directly given by the princess. One is the loot that she obtained after killing a second-class dark knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
