			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful piano melody exquisitely reveals the complex inner feelings of Lucien, with sweet tenderness, touching melancholy, and unspeakable grief. It seems that the quiet moonlight and the silvery scales of the quiet lake under the night sky bring all the listeners into a beautiful and dreamy peaceful world, and the heart slowly flows through the resonance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people have forgotten the irritability at this time, I don’t know how many people become quiet and contemplative at this time, and I don’t know how many people suddenly find the corners of their eyes. Consciously slipping away the tears... The first movement slowly disappears in such a quiet atmosphere, but the soon, light and lively second movement is played out as if to comfort everyone’s soul and show them gentle and joyful Smile, a perfect expression of emotional changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musicians who are waking up from the calm and melancholy aesthetic music atmosphere look a little surprised at each other, maybe those who are completely infected by music, it is difficult to think more The ordinary people and the nobility did not find it, but they were keenly aware that there was almost no pause between the two movements, and the abnormality was compact, but the effect was surprisingly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are not going to delve into the reasons for this, and continue to listen, because you can’t hear Lucien anytime, anywhere. The "Moonlight Sonata" played by Mr. Evans himself, what you need to do now is to appreciate it and not waste the opportunity of this concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second movement of bright and beautiful flowers is gradually low, but when everyone prepares to rest and adjusts slightly to appreciate the next intense melody, Lucien Without a pause, the third movement was played directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushing, fast-boiling notes lifted the hearts of the listeners, feeling the unstoppable enthusiasm and unrestrainedness, and picking on the edge of the cliff. The tension and rush of flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw Lucien’s hands jumping like the power of the gods, dancing, and showing a very complicated piano skill as a pleasant and intense The melody and the glamorous side play the figure. This is quite different from the elegance of the melancholy prince when he played the first movement, but it gave the same visual impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several sorghum notes of the surname are closed, and everyone’s heart falls back to where they were, and then they burst into violent applause, and the tides rushed and lingered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty with a short bow, joyfully to his sister Joanna and her brother-in-law Simon: "Compared with Mr. Evans’s performance, we have heard before. Those "Moonlight" are real. The unique melancholy and quiet and sweet sorrow, they can't show it at all, and the performance of the latter two movements, Mr. Evans gives the impact of the surname is stronger."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years of time made her seem to be professional in the appreciation of music...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, big The difference between a musician and a regular musician is of course great.” Joanna looked at the crystal wall and smiled softly. “Betty, I remember Mr. Evans promised you, and will play a piano piece privately. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty’s face became red with a brush: "Sister, don’t laugh at me, I know that I have a long way to go to stimulate blood." I have to go, but I will work hard, I will work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original agreement If it is able to become a full knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Vaurit's Principality is close to the Dark Mountains, giving us a lot of opportunities to temper. There is no place better than here to motivate our blood through adventure. "Simon thinks that after more than two years of time, he has improved in the strength of the high-ranking knight attendants, and is closer to stimulating the blood." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty nodded first, then looked at the piano and took a short break, preparing for the second sonata of Lucien: "Actually, I know Evans." Mr.’s appointment at the time was just to encourage me. I didn’t really expect him to play me a song privately. I was very satisfied with this concert. I certainly wouldn’t relax and not亵渎This is very important and very encouraging and 'dream' for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenton on the edge of the Municipal Plaza applauded with satisfaction and enthusiasm To the people around you: "The moonlight in Mr. Evans's hands is really beautiful. I can hear him play it once, I have no regrets. Hey, listen to other people's play later, don't feel it. This is the difference between a master pianist and others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original "Moonlight Sonata" should be compact and not paused, so that the contrast of emotions can be contrasted and the melody can be condensed to create a perfect feeling." Natasha is clear from the beautiful atmosphere brought by the moonlight. This special technique, "It's no wonder that when I played it myself, I always felt bad... I didn't mention this in his letter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe he thinks that Princess Highness can understand his ideas, so he forgot to write some performance requirements." Christopher was half joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to Lucien, he only contacted Natasha after the trip, even the letters to Joel, John and others were transferred through her, though Everyone knows that this is the most convenient and quickest way, because you can borrow the information system of the Vaurit Principality, but most people have their own minds, so the gossip is brewing and it is gradually settled. Some rumor. This has made many people who know the inside story look forward to the hope, the joy, the dissatisfaction, the dissatisfaction and the worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the humorous play of Master Christopher, Natasha did not care, seriously discussing each person's different music processing style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard their discussion, Grand Duke Ou Oli saw Natasha, awake from the sweet sad memories of Moonlight, brows Wrinkled but the expression is slightly gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the musicians and musicians who played "Moonlight" compared their performances and tried to find differences from the "original" performance to make corrections. But they will not completely imitate, because the "moonlight" of everyone's heart is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After a short break, Lucien continues to brew emotionally, or is familiar with "Sorrow", or a familiar feeling, just compared to the first When I heard it, everyone knows how to appreciate the feelings contained in it. The kind of grief that is not desperate, sorrowful and not giving up, is more and more aware of the music's touching hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorrow" was finished, Lucien held his fist in his right hand and put it in his mouth, hurriedly coughed a few times, letting the background witness the scene of Franz , Grace and Fabrini and others slammed their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, when they saw Lucien, they quickly recovered their calmness, and they all started to greet their cheeks, then re-sit on the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the piano passage of the illusion?" Because it is a solo, Fabriini, who has never heard of Lucian piano practice, curiously asks Franz and Grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, Franz is Lucy’s “assistant”, and Grace is his student and should know more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franz shook his head: "Mr. Evans practiced himself after rehearsing home, and a big musician like him, before the concert. No one forced the surname to ask for a preview, so I have not heard it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also. But the teacher has clearly stated that this is a piano passage that shows off the skill of the surname. , so it should be the one that is very difficult but the other is a little bit worse." Grace is doing the inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, all the voices in the Hall of the Holy Ghost and the Plaza Mayor stopped because they saw Lucien’s hands stretched out and pressed in the keys. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they seem to have heard countless bumblebees fluttering in the air, and the squeaking sound is like a ringing ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed is getting faster and faster, "The bumblebee is flying all over the sky", and Greenton and others are stunned to see Lucien’s hands as fast as humans. The race seems to bring out a strong sense of rhythm and passionate melody, so that people can't help but wake up after the heartbeat, and the whole body is passionate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beefly Flying" is one of the fastest and most vocal piano pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the speed of flying, the piano passage in just a few minutes ended before everyone reacted, and the ordinary people on the Municipal Square were full of blood and applause. Thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a kind of musical charm that they have never felt before. It seems that under the seemingly normal melody, it hides some kind of freedom and more arrogance and is closer to the ordinary. The strange feeling of man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
