			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you do this?" Although both blood types in the body are top-level, strong will, and tracking and anti-tracking training is excellent, but in this spirit and will are suppressed When the space encountered a high-order undead creature of unknown kind, Natasha was still very self-aware, and asked about the opinion of Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a similar field of assist, the magician has always been known for his variety of spells, each with a name for the surname, far stronger than the knights and clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pulled out a single piece of eye to cover his left eye, then there was a strange scene in the pupil of the left eye, the magnetic field turned, the current grew, A burst of electromagnetic waves diverge from the inside of the eye and from the inside of the body, and feedback back from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the five-ring magic "the eye of lightning" Lucien, this time is like a "humanoid radar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it is three hundred meters away, the electromagnetic wave feedback becomes chaotic and weak. Is this the strange suppression of this world? How does it feel like electromagnetic pollution?" Lu Xien through the mind The connection said to Natasha, "But it doesn't matter, let's move on, you still keep alert and search for nothing, let it get closer, we don't have much time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Natasha sighed softly, holding "Pale Justice", facing the forest on the side of the mountain, alternating her feet and moving quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave his right eye and Natasha each another a "true knowledge", pretending to be aimlessly looking for a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying fast for more than a minute, Lucien and Natasha looked at each other, nodded gently, then the speed of the two suddenly accelerated, dragging in place With a long afterimage, he slammed to the end of the mountain road, ready to turn to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien stopped without warning, his right hand to the ground, the six-ring magic "ground motion"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area of ​​nearly 100 meters swayed violently, and the undulating ripples spread toward the distance, and the trees were swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a verdant and dense canopy of a giant tree, a shadow of black light could not be prevented and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black light on it seems to absorb most of the electromagnetic waves, including visible light, causing an invisible effect, if not for Lucien to bless both of them. Real knowledge, I am afraid it is difficult to see and feel it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha took a step out and flashed a distance of tens of meters. "Pale justice" was swung from bottom to top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black shadow is a humanoid monster with a white tiger head. It is surrounded by an unusually evil death, as if it can directly escape the middle and low order. Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very agile, one roll in the air, avoiding Natasha’s slashing, the black claws popping out like a dagger To Natasha, at the same time, the fluctuations around me seem to be able to cast spell-like abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, its rolling scroll was twisted, and the whole body suddenly fell, as if it had been sent to Natasha's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pale Justice” deals with this evil creature as a legendary weapon, and it’s worn out by the tip of the sword and its falling momentum. The black light instantly collapsed and the body rotted rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a high-level evil beast who is good at hidden tracking and assassination." Natasha retracted her sword and said to Lucien in the spiritual connection. "Your magic is homemade? I have never heard of high-order spells that can interfere with gravity so much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, homemade The astrological system magic 'gravitational disorder'." This is a magical technique of Lu Xing who accidentally developed a gravitational gravitational force during the long process of combing knowledge and deducing the special theory of relativity and general relativity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was just curious, not asking: "We are leaving here, and then wrapped up by Congos’ high-ranking corpse, we are very You may have to face the legendary magician, be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the words are not finished, a huge stone will fly out of the forest, which is more muddy than the previous town. The boulder of the house was a big circle, and the violent wind was set off. The power was amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the ray and the boulder is like a desk and a toothpick, but the boulder suddenly disintegrates and turns into countless green light spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The forest rang with sorrow to the extreme, the pain to the extreme mourning, the trembling of the mind, the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha erects pale justice, keeps it in front, let the evil death method affect the mind, panic mourning is like a tide separating from the two sides, Bypassing her and Lucian, the beasts that were affected by it all fell into a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A giant with a height of five meters hit a tree and made a road out of nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark gray near-black giant with a pair of evil orange eyes, no hair at the top of the head, pointed ears, and dirty nails on both hands. Presenting the same orange, the most special thing is that there is a cloud of souls surrounded by the soul. Before that, the power of the banshee is almost from their mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least seven death giants!" Lucian learned the knowledge of monsters and made him recognize this non-dead servant. "The soul around him is divided." Two kinds, one is to kill after killing the enemy, can be restrained by the pale justice, but the other is the guardian soul that each death giant has formed after his death. It is passed down from generation to generation, not an evil type of undead. Pale justice may not be able to play the legendary level, and they cannot be directly killed and purified. Only by killing the death giant can they be destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful His evil shadows and flames."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual state of the death giant was quickly passed to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha clenched his sword and said: "Is there a way to suppress it so that I can directly attack its body and solve the battle as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After so many years of development, coupled with the assistance of the equipment, the knight and the magician face the same level of monsters have the advantage of overwhelming, so even the power of the death giant is high and holding the pale justice Natasha, she did not fear at all, just afraid of delaying time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used the undead to suppress the soul of the guardian." Although there are still a lot of magic to achieve the same purpose, but Lussin chose the shackles, Professional is good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one second, the two exchanged, Natasha picked up her back and was ready to go like a leopard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien had a layer of silent solid black and white, and the whole person was stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"X! This time!" Natasha couldn't help but swear a swear, slammed out, ready to stop the death giant, if this time Unclear to help Lucien get rid of the rigidity, she is not worthy of being a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Lucien’s change just started, the death giant seemed to have integrated into the surrounding soul and turned into a long evil shadow. Crossing the distance of hundreds of meters, I rushed to the front of Natasha and collided with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul mourns and mourns, and Natasha, who is prepared for some deficiencies, is defeated by the death giant by brute force, and the death giant is still faint. A lot, can continue to impact regardless of regardless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang, pale justice and evil shadows collide, but the guardian soul weakens a lot of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Natasha’s return to the sword could not be blocked, and the death giant flashed over, and the black evil shadow rushed toward the unguarded Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha silver-purple squats become cold, one upside down, flashing in front of Lucien, flying fast, the sword is full of force to the death giant heart position Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is attacked, the death giant has to temporarily stop, the souls around him merge into a black shadow to block the pale justice, the hands of orange nails flashed the demon light, scratching To Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Natasha gave up the defense, on the side of the body, letting the nail with the thick arm caught on the arm guard, and then "pale" Justice "give a little black shadow, borrowed to turn over, a sword crossed the neck of the death giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can Natasha give it another chance, and on the toes, he will fly a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a sacred radiance descended from the sky, shrouded the death giant, completely lost its vitality, and the souls entwined around them showed their expressions of relief. Slowly dissipate in the light column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Is it okay?" Lucien flew to Natasha with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha coughed twice and pointed to the left hand: "The armor is broken, and I will repair it after I go back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violet guardian armor has a deep crack in the arm guard, and it seems to have hurt Natasha's left arm, which has a black blood flowing inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly applied magic to stop the spread of black, slightly frowning: "Death giant nails contain evil death curses, mixed with toxins, people Decreased physique, dizziness, slow death, with your heavenly knight strength and top blood, death is not, but most of the strength will fall below the high level, and this must be solved with the seven-ring purification blessing, want to use four The ring must remove the curse and must be equipped with pharmacy aids."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha smiled tacitly: "So, you don't have enough materials to configure the pharmacy? What about you, are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that Lucien’s face showed an abnormal darkness, apparently a symptom of being attacked by evil shadows. When the black-and-white ray shrouded Lu Xien, all the magic effects on his body could not function properly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien found out that he had a problem, and quickly stopped using the magic to spread the trend: "You don't say, I haven't noticed yet, this should also be used. 'The Heart of the Sun' can be completely eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted: "I didn't pay attention to my injury, so care about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said it was frank and did not matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled two times: "The other materials of this medicine have left on me, only a kind of red called 'blood family' Flowers, because I think that this lowest level of magical plants can be seen everywhere in the main material world, so I am not prepared for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are going, the world and The main material world is the same, bloody family members should be easier to find, or else we will ask the residents of the mountain town." Natasha 叮嘱路西恩 seized the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and cast magic to take the death giant's heart, nails, and chest skin, ready to make high-end magic items in the future. Belt" and "cursed dagger". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s a shock, the half-god lich hasn’t arrived yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mountain town dominated by logging and hunting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who is still black, asked the passers-by, but he still did not find the traces of the "blood-blooded family" flowers, so Nata, who could not lift his left hand, could not lift it. Shah went to an old man who looked old: "Old gentleman, I want to ask you something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" This white hair The old man who has become scarce has indicated that he cannot hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out a few local copper coins and threw it in his hands: "Old gentleman, I want to ask someone in the vicinity who is good at identifying plants?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s gaze shines: “Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and handed the copper coin He: "Details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guest, if you want to find a guide, there is no need to go to the crazy Nika, he is a cruel and crazy The devil, his hands covered with blood, every day, is to break down a variety of animals, plants, monsters into small pieces, trying to find the mystery of the gods?" When the old man mentioned Nika, very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mystery of the gods?" Lucien and Natasha picked the left eyebrow at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
