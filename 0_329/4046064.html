Hearing Victor refused Lucian, Lott and Herodotus shouted at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucian’s piano rhythm has a lot of imperfections and places where the problems of playing, but they are resonated by music, they are There is no doubt about the shock and greatness of this piece of music. If Mr. Victor perfects and adapts the soundtrack, it will undoubtedly be the most exciting symphony in the last 100 years. It is the most beautiful and most famous in the symphony crown. Dazzling gems, but Mr. Victor refused? ! Refused to be a famous, great musician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made them subconsciously shouted out, wanting to stop Victor and convince Victor, even Felics on the side showed an incomprehensible expression, change It is her own, in the face of such temptation, facing such music, it is certainly impossible to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Victor made the decision, the whole person was like a sublimation and relief, a rejuvenation, a right hand press down, and made a quiet gesture. Look back at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Victor..." Lucien knows that unless he uses magic, he can't convince Victor who is so determined, he may be embarrassed, maybe desperate, It may collapse, but it will never violate its own beliefs. Therefore, just whispering a name and stopping, he comforted himself: "Fortunately, Mr. Victor regained his spirit and recovered his state even after the music infection, even if It is with the symphony of the past, and with two new pieces of music, the concert will be successful, but it is not so perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucien This expression, Victor smiled, his right hand pressed to the chest, facing Lucien awkwardly: "Thank you, Lucien, let me hear such wonderful, so powerful, so shocking music, this is my place. The most touched piece of music that touched my heart, this is the gift of the Lord, which gives me a new understanding of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I I can have this honor, in my In the concert, as a conductor, will you present such a great piece of music to everyone? I can’t wait to share this excitement with everyone. What the Lord told us is the tenaciousness of never failing to face difficulties and setbacks. And firm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah?" Lucien didn't expect such a change, and he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien stunned, Victor continued to ask humorously: "You don't want to, Lucien?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reacted and replied quickly: "No problem, Mr. Victor, although you use it, I am just, just strange, is this not your concert?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Occasionally you can also be a conductor, and you are still my student." Victor regained his original gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid..." Felice's leather boots are gently rubbed on the carpet, and the sound is so small that almost everyone can't hear, with deep Envy and relaxation, because this is Victor's performance of taking Lucien as his true disciple, and being able to adapt this piece of music to the performance of the concert will definitely make Mr. Victor's concert a success, and he will get a lot of himself. the benefits of". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing a newcomer’s work in his own concert, and introducing him to everyone, let his work be affirmed, and his fame rises rapidly. This is only a true disciple to let every musician do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for Mr. Victor’s decision, Felice did not have the anger he had imagined, because the piece of music was so shocking to himself that he could not To criticize Lucien's musical talents, facing the music he played, there was only the incompetence and faint ambiguity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such emotional changes also appear in the hearts of Lott and Herodotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard the whispered "stupid" and then understood the meaning of Mr. Victor. Things ended in this way, and it was somewhat beyond their expectations. So I can only nod my head: "I am honored, Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, is this really what you wrote? If there is a problem, Will let Mr. Victor lose all his reputation." Suddenly, a voice came, Herodotus was silent for a long time, after the emotional changes, or both hands clenched his fist and asked, his expression was somewhat distorted, I do not know is looking forward to the road Sean answered "yes" or "no". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he really a talented musical genius? Is he really a gem that is covered by mud? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbelievable, unbelievable eyes condensed on Lucien’s face, waiting for his answer, only Rhine and Victor were smiling with a touch of curiosity, Appreciating and looking at the past with surprise, they would never believe that such a piece of music was still unknown, and it was still not heard by people who have been immersed in the music world for many years. The only thing that surprised them was the road. Sean’s musical talent far exceeds his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart is slightly bitter, self-deprecating, although there is a bottom line, but the moral water is far less accurate than Mr. Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such an emotion was quickly and calmly convected by Lucien. At this point, there is no other explanation, so a smile is drawn: “Yes, it’s always my inspiration, but I’ve never been trained in formal music before, so this inspiration can’t be translated into the string I want.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “These inspiration comes from my life. It comes from the depression, suffering, despair, and no future life. Every time I see beautiful clothes worn by others, eating delicious food, I can never get closer. Life, I want to get rid of my life that seems to be arranged by fate, I want to fight for my future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to learn words, study In the process of music and hard work, I encountered many difficulties and obstacles, even being injured by the gangsters, but I did not give up, continued to struggle, and finally came to Mr. Victor's door, so this inspiration gradually became Excited and The string of non-speaking, it inspires me, as long as I am alive, I will never give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie with the truth, Lucien is also simply I talked about the recycling of my own garbage and the Aaron gang to raise the persuasiveness: "The difficulty and irony that Mr. Victor had encountered that day made me think of myself, the inspiration finally broke out, and the string appeared. During these three weeks, I have been trying to improve the melody. Lott, Felice and Herodotus have heard it. Well, I still have the scores recorded during this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was raining, I was afraid that the score would be spoiled, so Lucien put it in his own cabin and did not bring it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine and Victor smiled and looked at Lott and others. They never found the value of Lucian music. This is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lott, Felice, Herodotus, have you heard that?" Victor did not doubt Lu Xi'an's words, just felt very funny and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts by Lucien, Lott, Felice and Herodotus recalled carefully, only to find that there are many paragraphs in the string that I just heard. Familiar, and a little familiar with what they produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis thought of the evening yesterday, looked at Lucien in a complicated look, and said with self-deprecation: "Maybe prejudice makes us deaf, in fact, yesterday I I have heard the grandeur and brilliance of the final movement, but I didn't care. I have heard a lot of the strings belonging to this piece in the past three weeks, but most of the string's string was not written yet. The playing skills are also poor, and they are covered up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, she couldn’t help but ridiculed Lucien, but this irony It seems that it is just a girl's mouth hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, as Felice said, prejudice makes me deaf, I admit that I have heard certain strings of Lucian music." Lott thought After a while, I readily admit it. "I have to say that Lucien's musical talent is really amazing. Generally, the birth of this music is for months, even years."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien’s musical talent is not so exaggerated, Lott may still have thoughts, anger, guilt, and dissatisfaction, but the gap is too big, and all this will be lost. The motivation, and my classmates became great musicians, seems to be a good thing for my own music path, just like the great success of Mr. Victor's concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to do well in aristocratic families with complex relationships, Lott is not just a stupid man who knows the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herodod finally nodded after he had been silent for a long time, although he admitted that Lucien was a musical genius that made him very unhappy, but it was impossible. Rejecting the fact that the piece of music seems to still inspire itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
