			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Gao Tataling, the first-ever wizards opened the closed door and made the scene in the room clearly visible in Saman Shake and Rachel’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clean and clean study, every book is neatly arranged, without any confusion, the paper on the table is very well organized. A few piles, even if the draft papers are as meticulously stacked, every detail of every corner of the scene fully reflects the strictness of the owner Hawen to the pathologically forced surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chair behind the desk, Havin sat quietly there, and there was a layer of clear ice crystals on his body, even if it was July, the temperature of the fire, they It didn't melt too much, but turned the surrounding air into a hoarfrost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Havan in the ice sits very straight, dressed in a gray pointed hat, a large robes, a standard tower magician, and an arcane on the chest. The badge is grandly like an awarding ceremony for the "Evans Arcane Award" or the "Arcane Scepter Award". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s pale, stiff expression reveals a touch of confusion, despair and relief, with a glass of red wine in his hand, as if he would stand up and welcome everyone at any time, but His eyes are empty and not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really the way of death that Havin will choose, clean and fresh, full of graceful demeanor..." Rachel whispered to Samantha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all know Havin, after all, the arcane masters who had the hope of advanced six-rings in the towers, both competing and inspiring each other, the relationship is still They are well-informed, so they also know Hawen’s surname, but now they are already high-level arcans and magicians. Havin ended his life with ice and snow, which has to be said. It is the epitome of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha thought of his embarrassment, confusion and frustration during this time, and he felt very grateful: "In fact, in another ten years, Havin can also rise. Steps... In fact, desperate, should not give up, if it is me, I will live, live well, see what the arcane world will develop, see if we lose is worth it. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha text has serious obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, I have been trying to build a corresponding hormone magic to help him, but unfortunately..." Rachel said to himself, the teacher and Lucien? Some concepts that Evans proposed separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this kind of psychological problem can be dealt with magic, but it is only a short-term effect, such as using mechanized mind and other spells, unless A magician is willing to abandon normal feelings, and it will be a "completely solved" problem if it is constant for a long time. Therefore, it is not a minority that the surnames of the ancient magicians are extreme or crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the relationship of good friends, Samantha is no stranger to the psychological development of the arcane, nodded slightly: "In addition to the help of magic, you need to be abnormal The enlightenment, but there is always a lack of basic theory in psychotherapy, and it is impossible to converge the research into a complete system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, two people walking Entered Havin's room - as a friend of Havin, and a high-level magician, the rest of the arcane masters defaulted their authority to handle this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By benefiting from Havin’s “good habits”, Rachel and Samantha did not spend time looking for it, and they simply found a place on the desk. Sealed unclosed letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter paper in the letter has a faint scent of the book, folded into a square shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel did not care. After careful inspection, the letter was opened and the above content was read softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...The arguments of the past period have exhausted me. I can't imagine that the foundation of the entire astrology system will be subverted. No, it is the loss of the entire material world to determine the surname... I continue to argue with people and debate with others. The development of things is in the opposite direction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Recalling the rapid development of arcane in recent years, I deeply feel confused, we are now It’s ridiculous that it’s the product of fear, fear, and desperate resistance that we are happy with and satisfied with...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...My brain constantly thinks about various difficult and even contradictory problems. I can't get quiet in a second, but my thinking can't solve any dilemma. I am tired, very tired, want to end this. Life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading this letter of exhaustion, despair and sorrow, Rachel suddenly felt a little empathy. Except for a few of them, most arcane masters probably have similar feelings, only varying degrees of depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Havin...hee..." She wanted to say something, but in the end it turned into a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magicians who came to the scene were silent, as if they were mourning for Havin and sentimental to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha took his eyes back from Havin’s body and looked out the window. The midday sun in July was so brilliant, but it was so dazzling. Eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and Rachel clears his throat and prepares to arrange the next thing. At this time, come up a tower from the lift. The magician, holding a thick book in his hand: "Nature" issued a special issue "Mathematics Foundation"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice with obvious Joy, just a brief reading seems to let him see a well-structured mathematical hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mathematical Basis"?" Samantha asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower magician replied with great joy: "Yes, Lord Evans answers many current mathematical questions. Through these answers, he built a The dense and well-established mathematical system!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only answer this because he still has time to read it carefully. Suddenly, he found the situation in the study: "Hah, what happened to Havin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other magician told him the story and Havin’s last words, he was annoyed and regretted: "I should come up early. If Havin sees the book "Basic Mathematical Basis", it will definitely rekindle the enthusiasm for studying mathematics. I have had similar confusion and frustration some time ago, but now, these emotions can't stop me. The enthusiasm for mathematics, we have so many things worth doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha, Rachel listened to his exaggeration, forbearance I don’t want to live through books in his storage bag to help people buy directly in Havin. The library to read up. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no time to look at the specific derivation process, it is just a part of the concept of mathematical theory in the theory of numbers, sets, groups, domains, topologies, etc. Redefining them makes them refreshing. It seems that the scattered and random research in the past has formed an inseparable whole, connected with flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this book does not exceed their knowledge, because it is based on the current research in the field of mathematical science, and has been integrated and further Elucidation, the new concept proposed is not very difficult to understand, not only has a rigorous logic deduction process, but also hits the current difficulties encountered by the towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the book, Samantha, Rachel and others seem to see a new direction in the field of mathematics, seeing an unusually broad world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Previously, Evans often said that mathematics cannot rely on arcane and magic, and can't just serve the solution of their problems. It should be a rigorous deduction. And the deductive-based reading theory has its own problems. You can't pay attention to them because you don't use them." Rachel suddenly said, "I remember these words very clearly and I think it makes sense. In the actual research, I still ignore a lot of problems. Now, I fully understand the meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swept before the sorrow, confusion and confusion, It seems quite lively and seems to rekindle the passion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha is also very touched: "In the past, when applying scattered mathematical knowledge to solve problems, although it finally achieved its purpose, it always felt very embarrassing. Difficult, it seems that there are invisible walls around us that are blocking our efforts, and now those walls have disappeared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Lord Evans is still axiom The in-depth analysis and the complete axiom system of the high tower geometry is given." An arcaneist said the latter part, although Lucien proposed the concept of axiomatization very early, the arcane masters There are some researches and applications in practice, but after seeing this tower's geometric axiom system, he still feels that the basic idea of ​​mathematics seems to have changed quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
