			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether they are deliberately relaxing their vigilance, or being deceived by false information, Lucien directly used "Ball's transformation", muscle Slightly knotted, a layer of faint moonlight flowing, and the left hand silver and white dark gray awning complement each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they disappeared, they were only the night watchmen of the bishops and the knights. No matter how they could not withstand the advent of the angels, the huge force would shred directly. Their bodies and souls, so the angels they use to improve their strength should belong to the median, and the number and holiness of the angel wings behind them can be corroborated. As a result, their current strength is at the highest level, even if they have their mouths. The improvement of the enchantment of the "land of heaven" will certainly not reach the level of nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a faint moonlight, Lucien seems to have countless phantoms pounce on the two, the speed so that they can not tell who is the entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright light behind Minsk, a layer of reddish scales appearing on the body, the two eyes have a golden color, the pressure of the top creatures is like In essence, he opened his mouth, his teeth were sharp, and his smoke was lingering. A large red pillar of fire covered all the illusions in front of him. The high temperature of the red dragon breathed the surrounding light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juliana had a silver-white sword around her, with a sacred eye on it, sharp to the extreme, they revolved around Zhu Liana spins up and protects her in the middle, and anything that tries to pass them will be twisted into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most effective defense against the Cavaliers attack in the six-level magical "sword barrier", the phantom moonlight is cut and shredded by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Juliana’s angel wings seemed to be completely unfolded without her control, and a holy beam of light entwined with flames descended from the sky and slammed straight into one phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julianna’s eyes suddenly widened and she found that Lucien’s left hand was in her left hand and caught the sun that was thicker than his body. Explosion, and what is unbelievable is that the sacred and vast pillars of light have turned into pieces of shattered light, scattered and scattered, and integrated into the "land of heaven". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the matter with his left hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horror just appeared in Juliana’s mind, and she saw Lucien’s left hand clenched into a fist and slammed on the blade barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-cut long sword was cut and cut, but when it hit Lucien’s left hand, it disintegrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This left hand has no sluggishness, like a layer of paper that passes through the blade barrier, and it’s too late to play other magic. Juliana's side face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the crisp bone breaks, Juliana’s right face is deeply sunken, white, red jets, before her The numerous defenses and increases in blessings have completely failed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sheer ray of light bursts out in Juliana's body, trying to escape, and another punch that was followed by her left hand was directly destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juliana fell backwards, and the coagulation of her eyes was stunned and frightened, with a hint of hatred that could not be resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "The Night Watch Red Dragon" Minsk approached Lucien and saw the miserable end of Juliana, a heart, hatred and fear At the same time, the ups and downs, I do not know whether to continue, or to escape by means of the heavens on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short hesitation, he chose to retreat, waiting for the great King of Angels and Cardinal Sald to succeed, not afraid to find Opportunity to take revenge? With the surname, you can slowly torture the professor's wife, students, friends, and relatives and bring yourself to death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just turned around, but suddenly found that a slender and powerful hand pressed over to himself, so his mouth opened and the red dragon breathed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high temperature to the terrible flame is burning everything, but under the left hand pressure of Lucien, it is extinguished like ordinary candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand seems to be slow, but quickly and abnormally pinched to the neck of Minsk, the layer of sturdy red scaly scales is the most feared The object has faded on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague consciousness, Minsk is full of grief: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His left hand is not only a curse invalidation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light group in Minsk was also wiped out, Lucien searched for the items on them and saw if there was anything that was indulging in the "land of heaven", but they were empty and nothing. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the increase of angels and the increase of the heavens on the earth, the two fourth- and fifth-level vigils can burst out of the strength of seven or eight, which is a bit scary, but This 'ground heaven' seems to be connected with the Lentat enchantment. If you control the center of the Nesser Palace to control the city enchantment, it should be able to greatly weaken the impact." Lucien made his own feelings and the situation just now. Judging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexus has two cores of magic, one is the inner defense, protecting the queen from the legendary strongman spikes and snoops, under the control of Natasha One is the outer defense, which can control the enchantment of the whole city. If the core of the magical cathedral has been destroyed, it is the only center that can affect the enchantment, but it is not known as the dark night. The Walker is controlled by Winston, and it is still someone else, and his goal is to cooperate with Natasha and Lord Morris, etc., to master it with the majesty of the king and his own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching Nexus Palace, Lucien suddenly stopped, his face dignified and worried, seemingly waiting for something, because he did not continue to use magic, His body gradually withdrew from the "land of heaven" and returned to the normal Rantart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Buriana, the capital of Salivar, Bolivia cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was noon, there were only two believers who came to pray, and the red cardinal of the sermon seemed to be perfunctory. Suddenly, he saw the white hair band. The 50-year-old noble gentleman stood up and walked toward the back of the cathedral with a black cane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't..." The Cardinal reached out and stopped, but suddenly saw that his fingers were in violation of conventional distortions, internal organs, muscles, blood, brain, etc. Each thinks about different directions, and the surrounding space is distorted by the black horror magnetic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he is divided into countless small pieces, and there is a small electric mangling on the flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A step, Brooke crossed the atrium, the environment around him changed rapidly, the "electromagnetic kingdom" projection of strong magnetism and current resonance emerged, and Buffal’s residence was completely Shrouded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beverly stunned: "Brook?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t seem to think of this legend The peak of the "master of control" will attack himself, is he not afraid of causing the outbreak of a full-scale war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace shrouded by the sacred sect, a short, sturdy, seemingly dwarf knight floats in the air, looking at the Cathedral of Perth. I saw that the building guarded by layers of magical enchantment seemed to have a devil inside. The black shadows continued to expand and harvest. From time to time, a huge silver-white electric light flew out of the church and hit the sky like a heaven and earth. reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brook has the ability to control magic, Beverly estimates that it will not last long, Bedrenka, we are not going to save him?" A giant bear The burly knight looked at the battle and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Hammer of the Void" Bedrenka smiled twice: "If Brooke does not control the scope of his own magic, it is estimated that we have to be the god of the whole city." The opening of the enchantment will prevent Salivar from being completely destroyed. Beaver is not even with the saints, and there is no preparation, how to deal with him? Not to mention that Holt is helping. We will wait again, see Looking at the situation in Rantart, I don't want to face Brooke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is said that there has been some change, poor Beaver, even if I look for an opportunity to open the transmission. It is estimated that there will be no reinforcements. If I am him, I will find a chance to escape now. How far is it to run." "The catastrophe knight" Bassol is cold and cold, "I will suppress the nobility and other priesthoods." Personnel, wait until Fernando says things, if you can't convince us, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belderenka just wants to answer, the pupil shrinks sharply, straightforward The enchantment of the gods, the entire city was dyed with the white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of support, the enchantment of the enchantment was broken, and the empty areas such as the woods and squares near the cathedral became huge potholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the enchantment is less than a second, it is estimated that the aristocratic area will be completely destroyed..." Bedrenka slightly rejoiced, "Fortunately, there is no The shot blocked Brook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary peak, the top ten purification sequence, is definitely not a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Song of Dusk" Youssner is in the Erica After the battle with Terence forced Cux, he stopped, far from the side, did not help the church, and did not fall to the parliament. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the many years of parliamentary pledges, under the pledge of two or three hundred years of life, he made a decision to wait for the situation to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at Terence, a rainbow dragon's Elika and the wise angels, and the half-plane projections that entangled with each other and On the fifth floor of Heaven Mountain, Youssner sighed softly: "To maintain the good situation before, you don't need to make such a difficult decision, Fernando, see how you can convince me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collet, the North Coastal Corridor is almost the same situation, the only difference is that the "burning lady" of the North Coastal Corridor is actively waiting, Colette's "life "Reap" is shocked by the strength of the "Death of the Soul" Vicente. Even if it is two-on-one, he may be able to achieve the final victory. After all, the colleague of Colette is not a saint, and the necromantic The legendary magician has always been known as the "helper". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Nexel Palace, Thrall’s figure slowly emerges come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not move first, but looked at the direction of the Glorious Cathedral until the light of the super-large transmission array lit up, and he walked out of the "land of heaven" The light of the Holy Light, a calm and deep face, could not help but bring a smile, a spirit, a majestic appearance, striding towards Nexel Palace:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Pope’s Majesty should have led the Cardinal’s members to come, facing Douglas and the easily persuaded chaos, and the angel’s Lord's 'help', he either ruined or consumed all the remaining life to perform the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only one purpose from beginning to end, which is to promote comprehensive The war broke out before the restoration of the Pope's gods. The consumption of the Magic Council caused the Pope to die in advance. He did not worry that the Magic Council would not cooperate because it was a righteous conspiracy and created a better situation for them than to postpone a year of war. Which one they will choose, it goes without saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the pope is degraded, the enemy is killed, it is time for me to lead the seven epic knights to save the church. With such credit and what I have mastered." I will undoubtedly climb the throne of the pope and truly grasp the secret.” Thrad walked slowly to the door of Nexus, and he did not expect to be able to destroy them if the Magic Council was prepared, but he believed In the accident of the King of Angels and the follow-up blazing angels, the Magic Council will damage some of the legendary magicians, and this will balance the changes in the church due to weakened power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said to himself: "So Douglas, Brooke, Fernando, you must work hard to be loyal to His Majesty’s Anasta, Mary, I will be very grateful to Beaver and others for killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, there were no cardinals trained by the Pope as successors, and Without the radical cardinal and the night watchman, his conspiracy was not revealed under the cover of the King of Angels. Who would believe in the rumors of the legendary magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xi's left hand should not only be a curse invalidation, it seems quite weird, but Juliana and Minsk have angels coming, should be able to entangle him Time, when I let go of my hand, I took him Masjilin’s sly.” He didn’t think that Juliana and Minsk could come back alive, or didn’t want them to come back alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before this, the matter of gathering the seven epic knights begins with the Nexus Palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
