We have begun to receive the attention of high-order vampires, and the action is getting more and more dangerous... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please lower your guidelines again, let the devout dwarves escape the slavery of the vampires, stay away from the night plateau and get a new life."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam is supreme."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The icon in front of Augustus is quite weird, it is a thick tower-shaped long arrow, round toot Dust ash, carved with countless strange Pattern. This is what they have shaped from the shape of the devastating weapon they saw in Atlantis - in the words of Lucien, this is called "Benedicting the God of the Rock." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is completely squatting, and Augustus prays piously that the god of steam will once again lower the gods, even if it has passed more than three years, no steam has been obtained. He did not have any doubts about the guidance of the gods. He only believed that it was the test of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, his mood was urgent and worried. When the team did not grow up, relying on the favor of Earl Vlad, the death of Madame Tess, in this On the territory, the dwarves are well-versed. With the addition of knowledge and control of some minerals, blacksmiths, their equipment is quickly renewed, high-pressure steam rifles, vampires, bullets, and Mithril can effectively defend against vampire claws and other weapons to face bloody servants and lower-order vampires. With the ability to counterbalance, it is no longer simply passively beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the number of dwarves in the steam gods grew more and more, and they developed into the territory of the nearby middle-level vampires, the situation was critical. Powerful melee strength, spell-like ability, and horrible speed make them often have to fight hundreds of people to damage the middle-level vampire, so that the other party can retreat. Even after the invention of the bombs that did not distinguish between me and the enemy, there was no good effect. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Harold and Quinkins, unless the cannons of the ancient steam civilization can be restored, a large range of shots can be killed, it is expected to kill the speed Amazing mid-level vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But with our existing knowledge, standards, and conditions, it is impossible to create that kind of horrible cannon..." Quinkins, the leader of the Dwarf Rebels, was then It’s so desperate to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Steam God" Archbishop Augustus is more worried about the earth: "This is still a middle-level vampire, if we alarmed the high-order, or wait until Fula De Earl wakes up, even if the giant ship cannon is of no use, unless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless" is not finished, but whether it is Quinkins, Harrow De. It is still very clear that the Archbishop is talking about the ultimate weapon of steam civilization in Atlantis that can destroy the entire night plateau and create a legendary sun for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it. Augustus prayed more and more piously, and the most dangerous situation was the moment to test trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dominate everything, control the boundaries between life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End the prayer. Just about to get up, Augustus suddenly sounded a solemn voice in his mind:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The near future is approaching, pick up the scepter and guide the dwarves to get Freshmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has eyes wide open, excited again and again, his tongue is unclear: "Oh your name. Follow your life." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt the light shining in front of him, and the dim underground cave became as bright as the silver moon. This is the illusion caused by his great joy eruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is known from the ancestors of the ancestors that the dwarf ancestors came from another place, he completely could not think of how to leave the night plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow my guidelines, don't ask why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect for you May your glory shine away from all sufferings and evils." Augustus was instructed, and the old face glowed with dazzling brilliance. Stepping out of the ritual stage, opening the stone gate, arrogant, excited and confident to the outside dwarf: "To convey the command to all the steam god dwarves, gather here within three days. The great steam god has released the gods, we will leave Dark night plateau!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, under the leadership of the dwarf girl Mirna, all the dwarves present in the audience shouted: "Steam is supreme!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of joy and excitement are on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This large underground cave in the Count of Vlad is filled with dwarves from nearby secrets, close to 21,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are carrying a high-pressure steam backpack, carrying a huge steam rifle, guarding the entrance to the cave, some ragged, whip marks everywhere, the only The same place is a dazzling hope glory on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time of the gods has arrived, I am very satisfied that every living steam god believer has come here, which shows your piety, You will be redeemed." Augustus wore a robes that were short blouses to humans, holding a silver ash like a "missile" scepter. "And I, the god of steam, the spokesperson of the earth, will lead you forward." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the road, no matter how dangerous, how desperate, don't be afraid, don't pause, we have the blessing of God!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Departure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf responded in unison with "steam first" and then arranged according to the "Military Training Manual" given by the gods In a team, walk neatly and quietly in the underground cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all understand that staying in the night plateau will not see any hope of life, and sooner or later will die humiliatingly, and the appearance of the god of steam immediately makes desperate They found the sustenance of the soul, the left is also dead, the right is also dead, it is better to fight once, even if a small part of the dwarf hesitates and fears, it is also under the influence of the surrounding people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a cave, the terrain gradually rises and there are dense tombstones around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a hero who has sacrificed for the survival and hope of the dwarf for three years. They have warriors, some are ordinary dwarves and women who cover the warriors. At the moment when the dwarves live and die, every dwarf is a hero.” Augustus said loudly at the forefront and extended deep respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand six hundred and ninety tombstones watched them silently. The atmosphere became solemn and solemn. Suddenly, there was a sharp and squeaking sound behind the cave. Seven or eight ordinary vampires, led by two or three powerful vampires, started the bat wings and flew! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is San Nielsen!" The dwarf screamed and recognized that it was a vampire knight who had murdered hundreds of dwarves, level five. "They chased it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are traitors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone was caught on the way? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panic, desperate fears spread in the dwarves, and these vampires are close to high-level. In such a dense and crowded environment, the death and injury of others and others will not know how heavy it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold looked at his compatriots and hesitated. Then he vomited and spit, loudly: "The warrior of the mechanical knights stood up! We snarled for the god of steam, and the glory of the dwarves was coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;X, death must stand dead, death is also worthwhile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the mechanical knights who carried the huge steam rifle hesitated and cringed. Some stood up after gnashing their teeth. The rifle was shot at the rear with the steam, but only hit a common vampire and let him mourn. Rolling on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Harold was a little desperate, Augustus’s voice sounded: “On the road. No matter how dangerous or desperate, don’t be afraid. Can't stop, we have the blessing of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter who you are, put away your weapons, move on, don't pause. We have God's blessing!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a glimmer of hope in the rebellion, so that all the moves will be tragic! Harold looked puzzled at Augustus. However, he was shocked by his harsh eyes and had to give orders: "All the members follow the progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf slowly precedes the doubtful fear and the vampire's sharp voice OK, it seems that I can already feel the dangerous atmosphere of the terrorist pressure. Suddenly, they suddenly found that the surrounding tombstones began to shake. A dwarf body climbed up from the grave, and some had become white bones, and some still rotted. Pieces of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they thought it was the magical ability of the vampire to control the body, more than 2,000 tombstones fell around, and the dense body stood up, as if the dead The world is on the ground, gloomy and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge scene is completely beyond the imagination of the dwarves, and some even think that the dead are resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these bodies rushed silently toward the rear, connecting the vampires in pieces, and occasionally making a huge explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are they still guarding us when they are dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are free from the dwarfs Is it so persistent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another holy name for the god of steam is 'the master of life and death'..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold squinted and looked back at the comrades in the past who blew themselves up and shouted: "I must fulfill your wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the obsession of our dwarf family for thousands of years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he shouted: "Steam is supreme, keep moving forward!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the "Dwarf Heroes Cemetery", walked out of the underground cave, and there was a huge stone in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "Steam of the Gods" guide, Augustus smoothly opened the door to the underground palace, with the dwarf sneak in, saw a center in the lobby Deep and mysterious door with a shining starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the gate, it is the new world, the world of salvation." Augustus pointed to the door. "Dwarves without hesitation, no doubt can now Go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is this, who will hesitate? Under the order of Harold, the dwarves entered the gate and disappeared into the same place. The space turbulence gradually became fierce. However, none of the vampire princes of the night plateau were in their own castles, all of them invested in the “rescue” ancestor action, while the high-order vampires were not so sharp, and the only close-up Count of Vlad was still angrily trying to get out of the blockade. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When only the members of the Mechanical Knights were left, the vampires such as Sainilsen finally got rid of the entanglement of the undead and killed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" The members of the Mechanical Knights glanced at each other, and they had to hand over the vampire whose face was twisted and twisted so that the remaining comrades could leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold kept his chest: "Don’t be afraid, don't hesitate, let's move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Harold and other dwarves and blood-stained vampires suddenly heard a "clam" of crisp sound, seeing a silvery coin above the gate is rolling up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tumbling of coins, there are twisted magnetic fields and silver currents around them. They are entwined and twisted into a huge electric snake with the core of the coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
