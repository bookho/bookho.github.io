			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several carriages drove smoothly across the street, slowly stopping under the huge magical minaret in the middle of the Sky City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it still doesn’t think it’s right, but Heidi, Lei Yi Liya and other apprentices are full of surprises, because the neck needs to look very tired to see Go to the spire of this magic tower. And unlike the ancient mysterious magic tower, the outer layer is made of silver-gray material with metallic light, and there is a thrilling beauty that the apprentices can't describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, modern metal-like buildings." This type of building is one of Lucien's favorite styles, and the goodwill of the Magic Council is suddenly improved. Quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar as the "master", very satisfied with Lucien's love for this magic tower, see the former Felipe and others disappeared at the gate He gently smiled and said: "This is the magic tower where the headquarters of the parliament is located. It is also called Allinge. It is a paradise that many magicians yearn for. Well, let's go in, it is already 4:15 in the afternoon. The staff at the headquarters of the parliament will rest at six o'clock, and only a few will be responsible for the safety and supervision of the entire city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lazar, can you come again tomorrow? We are too tired and need to rest." Many magic apprentices are quite afraid of the level of the Arcane level. Even Annick has hesitated and has not experienced repeated accumulations. His confidence has not been completely established. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar took Lucien and the magic apprentices to the gray stone steps in front of the magic tower: "You have just arrived today, exhaustion is indeed a problem. However, you need to ask yourself to the gentleman or woman who is responsible for the assessment. They will reschedule the assessment time for you. However, if you have not experienced the assessment, you will not be able to receive the two badges of magic and arcane. Many things will be more troublesome. When you start learning about arcane and magic, you can become a true magician one day earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not let the apprentices assess in a tired state, but reminds They don't want to quit after a day's rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the group went to the silver-gray gate of the magic tower that painted countless mysterious lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is ready to go straight through the half-open door, there are two big black eyes suddenly appearing on it, looking at the opposite: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to Allinge, I welcome everyone on behalf of all the arcians and magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The light and pleasant voice is from the door, and the two metal doors sway back and forth, seemingly waving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard laughed and said: "Prosper, you have never welcomed me like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I smelled the breath of life." Prosper did not care about Lazar's joke. Lazar turned his head and said to the stunned apprentices: "Prosper, a powerful alchemy life that blends with the magic tower, is a few of Douglas and so on." The Great Arcane Lord spent a long time collecting special broken souls to refine it. Oh, there is a lot of alchemy life at the Parliament Headquarters, and no place is more luxurious in this similar way."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien began to be very interested in the life of alchemy from the beginning of the castle of Karendia, and could not help but ask: "Lazar, the knowledge of alchemy life is from a few rings Start learning?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“First you need the Necromancer tree of the soul about the soul, and then learn the basics of the alchemy life reconciliation. Wait until these studies Finished, when you become a high-level magician, you can make alchemy life. Oh, so in the ancient magical empire, only high-level magicians can have their own magic tower." Lazar introduced casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosper’s voice suddenly turned low: “This gentleman, if you are interested in alchemy life, please refine a lady later, around me. The magic tower is an annoying male name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image of this alchemy life was immediately equated with the wretchedness in the eyes of Lucien and others. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien without answering, Prospergan laughed: "Haha, I am joking. Hey, the 'Apprentice Assessment Department' is a three-story area. 'Magician Management Department' is a four-story area. The first floor of the five districts is the 'task area', which can accept tasks and release tasks. The first floor is the 'exchange department', helping you to put money, materials and articles in your hand. , intelligence, etc. converted into arcane points, or vice versa. 'Ordinary Arcane Library' is a layer and a district, 'Magic Exchange Room' is a layer and two districts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“The 11th to 15th floors are the offices of several committees and the exclusive lounges of the committee members. The 16th to the 20th floors are the places where the 'Arcane and Magic Research Group' is eligible for free. The first to twenty-story layers are the best magical laboratories in different fields of research. From the 26th to the 30th floors, there are 'higher arcane and magical libraries', material warehouses, high-order summons, etc. The first to the 35th floor belong to the highest congressional group, but I heard that the Supreme Council recently wanted to draw out the 31st and 32nd floors as a college that tried to focus on teaching low-level magicians..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosper 噼 啪 啪 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一 一<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are going in." Prosper sang a song that was not toned after he finished:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't touch it, it's my muscles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't touch the wall, then I will be itchy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not destroy public property, the internal organs are always fragile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... in this ancient eccentric alchemy life "Farewell," Lucien and others finally walked into the parliament headquarters. The first thing that appeared in front was a circular silver hall. In the center of the hall, there was a one-meter-diameter disc with a complex magic array. Around the disc is a yellow-green reticle that extends all the way to the second layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six areas and stairwells around the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the lift." Lazar introduced, and then sought advice from Lucien, "We first go to the 'Apprentice Assessment Department' in the three districts, Waiting for the apprentices, I will bring Evans to the 'Magician Management Department' in the 4th district. Is there no problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No problem, after all, I They also guided them for a while.” Lucien didn’t mind, looking at the magicians and apprentices who came close to the Holm style, and followed Lazar to the third district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............There are rows of rooms of different colors in the three districts. A long, cheeky, old-fashioned gentleman received Lazar and Lucien. Wait for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old gentleman named Simeon said seriously to the apprentices: "You will register first, then I will provide you with basic arcane assessment, etc. Know your arcane level and inclination, and arrange for you to enter different magic schools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Simeon, we have just experienced the bumps of the stormy strait Arrived at noon today, and then took a three-hour magic steam train, already very tired, can you postpone the arcane examination to tomorrow?" Katrina is not afraid of herself, but she thinks she is one of the first apprentices. At this time, I did not hesitate to stand up and ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reasonable request. Although Simeon is old-fashioned, it is not a stone heart, so he nodded: "Then you will register first, and I will check it here at 9:00 tomorrow morning. I will arrange for you to rest in the rooms of the 3rd district in the evening. Remember, you don't have two badges of Arcane and Magic, you must not go out of the three districts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Mr. Simeon, we must remember." Apprentices are overjoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at them in order, and Lucien stood still and didn’t move, the clothes were dressed in an obvious continental style, and Simeon was slightly puzzled: You don't register?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Simeon, I am a formal magician." Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Simeon's old-fashioned face was a little surprised, and then looked up and down the road to Weston: "The magician less than twenty years old? Spiritual talent is very Outstanding. If you want to learn the magic of the stars or the light and dark, or concentrate on the study of mathematical knowledge, consider joining our 'high tower'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar's eyes looked at Simeon, "sorrowful": "Mr. Evans wants to concentrate on the basics of arcane learning, and wait until he has a formal arcane level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ximeon wore two badges, a black silver star, like a deep starry sky, but only two stars, one is a silver ring against the two black rings, cold and mysterious. According to Lazar's previous introduction on the train, the former is the badge of the second-class arcian, and the latter is the badge of the second-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
