			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scarlet Plain. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body is slender like a lizard's double-headed demon standing in Stonehenge, motionless, dark red scales reflecting the sun, twinkling colors, In the gap between the scales, a root bud seems to be born from the flesh and blood, thriving, adding a layer of green "guest clothes" to the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody king's face above the head of the goat, solidified with a sly smile and a tremor just twisted, the head of the dog is a very abnormal The appearance, the uncontrollable killing and resentment make it horrible, they don’t understand at all, in their "legendary plane", why is it so easy to be caught by the legendary third-order self, normally, the same The order of the hand, can not beat, can not escape, especially at home! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced Time Stop", the most powerful of the current time-space magic, is not a magician who has in-depth mastery of time and space or is born with such spell-like ability. "Magic creatures of silver moon" and other "magic creatures" can not even be mastered at first, even if there are lengthy spells and complicated gestures, don't want to display them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is able to perform, his exclusive legendary items can release "advanced time stop"! Is his occupation not "atomic control"? When is it related to time and space? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bloody king numbness, the boring brain faintly feels that he has left something, but this messy guy has no understanding of the arcane, how to know In general, the general theory of relativity belongs to the field of the paper. In fact, the pursuit of the progressive human face goat head once thought about the development of the arcane, learning the basic concept, but every time it picks up the book to read, the dog head will be very I was so upset that the two heads were caught in a long and traditional bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for "luxury big cracking", it is not surprising with Malfurion, Lucien? If Evans can't learn, then he is not worthy of being called the authority of the element and the field of force field. He will inevitably become the second parliamentary legend after the "Elemental Dominator" Hathaway to master this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Revenge Gaze" ignores the penetration attack of the body scale defense, Malfurion did not notice that it is "luxury big crack" stripped the defense The effect is that the two heads of the bloody king are puzzling, this is their own natural defense, the luxury big crack can destroy the part, it can't make it completely invalid, but why is it like being stripped of scales, naked? Standing here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its "understanding" of arcane, this is obviously something that it cannot understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This really failed, how can he master so many powerful magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not only failed, but also caught, it is not overfulfilled the plan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two devil heads are slowly and differently The idea, the chest is "revenge gaze" through the wounds, flesh and blood squirming, but how can not recover, dark red blood with a silky green drops on the ground, corroded through the slate, corroded the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are items on the bloody king?" Malfurion flew to the bloody king and found that it had deep black air around his waist. Under the big crack, there are still things that survive? Legendary items? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the "blood-splitting king", a "schizophrenic patient", cannot and cannot refine the legendary items for himself, at most, roughly to some part of his body. Transformed into a weapon, for example, its bloody tail with a pattern is broken, and there are two more dark red swords in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, is it the harvest of killing adventurers or other enemies? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." Lucien reminded, "I feel it is evil and negative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Natasha carrying the "Sword of Truth", warning around, there is no doubt about the choice of Lucien's full force shot, just a little regret for the bloody king without any resistance, he has no fighting. opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion lifted his hand, and a green branch grew out of the flesh and blood of the "Bloody King" and lifted it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Malfurion's eyes condensed and his face became very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragund's sculptures seem to be imaginary, his face is twisted and twisted, full of hatred, disgust, anger, and ugly, and there is a faint black air in the surrounding void, blending into its body, these black Qi seems to be the endless "infernal symbol" of the abomination of the heart of every intelligent creature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Collect the power of emotions and try to transform into the state of the ancient devil." Lucien calmly described the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion whispered with disappointment and anger: "It turned out to be Ferragad! Natural hate is too much!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessarily, how can Ferragaund's collection of special items of emotional power be held by bloody kings?" Lucien looked at the bloody king with a dull expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the conditions for cooperation, maybe this special item must be placed near the altar." Malfurion speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I don't think there is any normal spirit of the legend that will find the bloody monarch, this double-headed demon cooperation, maybe when it is due to ' The guilt has gone wrong. Anyway, we have caught it and used the magic of 'invading the brain' to check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, Lucienton paused "But before this, this statue can't be left. It's a key item in the state transformation ceremony. Whether it's Ferragad or not, this item is very important. It's ruined early, we will feel at ease."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also prevents Malfurion from being tempted by the value of the statue, and the black hand at the crucial moment, so Lucien, who did not have any heart to the statue, decided to eliminate the scourge as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Malfurion had just hated the traitors inside the elf and had not yet greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of Natasha Truth is erected, staring at the statue of Ferragad, which Malfurion flew, and Lucien seems to be leisurely The right hand is clinging to the "monthly timepiece", always guarding Malfurion's sudden shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paralysis effect disappears, the bloody king's face goat head looks angry and frustrated at the statue, according to the normal plan, when he pretends to fail to retreat, the statue will be lost Into the center of the altar, to create the illusion of destruction of evidence, and then, the statue of negative emotions will be entangled with the heart of nature, and can no longer be destroyed normally, can only be slowly divided by Malfurion's natural magic. Then the ceremony will be launched and its mission will be completed smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can you really fail? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still doesn't make sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion did not go to see Natasha destroying the statue with the sword of truth, but instead turned his attention to the altar and found that the altar was filled with chaos Mysterious patterns of negative feelings such as killing, hatred, and pain. They extend from the center and go deep into the underground of the blood-colored plain and the surrounding voids, forming a huge and three-dimensional "magic array." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The state of the magical array in the world of the door is very similar..." Lucien said in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No accident, in the center of the altar, in the core of the magical array, a group of light green and vigorous air mass, exudes a strong vitality and freshness, let the altar Inside, there are lush trees that grow into a small forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little black plaque in the light green of this group, which has obviously been infiltrated by the abyss of negative emotions and killing chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha's body suddenly blurs and blends with the silver-gray sword light to break through the sky and smash the sky. Dark statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To destroy the convergence of negative emotions, the most convenient and effective is of course the "Sword of Truth"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario threw out a few wooden statues, turning them into dark green monsters, rushing to the center of the altar, trying to take out the heart of nature "breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody dusty sky is suddenly dim, dark as thick ink, a sly-like head is highlighted from the darkness, eyes closed, face scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a huge dark black palm descended from the sky, grabbing the statue, ignoring the sword light that Natasha came! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness around, a black tentacle extends intensively. Anything that comes into contact with them, whether it is white stones or dark green wood, is wilted and decayed into sludge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s right hand, the hourly tick ticking away, his thumb was alert with a warning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Click", the black tentacle stopped in place, faded the color, leaving only the grayish bleak, the sunken plain kept the current state, white stone, The dark green woods each show some art of destruction with varying degrees of withering and decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark sacred song disappeared, and the huge dark black scales solidified in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the advanced time stop effect, the eyes of the skull in the sky suddenly opened, and the different colors such as green, dark red and golden changed rapidly, giving abnormal confusion. An unusually evil feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the crisp illusion sounds, the gray is broken, the color returns, and everything is restored to the state when the moonlight is pressed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It actually broke the advanced time stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil Prince..." Malfurion and Lucien recognized the identity of this demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I know that the schizophrenic guy of the bloody king can’t stand it. What's wrong with it?” Lanhill smiled and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand secretly depressed, he ruled out a little devil projection, and was seriously injured, otherwise this is a great opportunity to escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lan Hill has seen a problem, dare not care about it, use his spell-like ability to trap Ferragand, and then anxiously back and forth Step, waiting for the altar on the Scarlet Plain to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the emptiness of the sky, the light green lines wrapped in dark and negative air quickly spread out, centered on Ferragad An unusually complex three-dimensional magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill breathed a sigh of relief and smiled happily: "Almost started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferragad's body began to blur, and the light green color was an ugly face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill began to come up with all kinds of things and set the final steps of the ceremony. He didn’t think that he would become a god in the near future, just want to promote the legend. The peak, and lay a solid foundation for the future of the god-like road. He is not stupid, how can he venture into the market, especially this method has yet to be verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One root or light green, green, or dark black, turbid lines are lit up one after another, and he also forms a complex mystery Three-dimensional magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lanhill, I curse you!" Ferragad shouted sternly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill smiles: "Very good, keep this state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The right hand stretched forward and pressed in the center of the magic array, so the two magical arrays were connected together, the light and shadow interlaced, and the energy flowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the surrounding time and space are bright and light green, and the magical pattern around Ferragand’s body is stripped and reversed into the side of Lanhill. Magic array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ring is lit up, and Lanhill is imprisoned in the middle of the magic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, how could this be?" Lanhill had no idea what had changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand also looked at the scene with a blank look, his head as a paste, not knowing how he was saved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array suddenly brightens, the energy seems to extend to the distance, and the light green color around it is transparent and transparent, showing the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
