So they indicated that they entered the three-storey villa and the garden in front of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fillis, I have one thing to ask you." Lucien looked serious and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis's nice eyebrows are slightly wrinkled: "What? I can't promise to help you, my father is just the clerk of the town hall, and the uncle And Harrington’s cousin has never liked our family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s before the concert, Lucien’s request, Felice must be a bite Refused, but after a great success in preparing concerts and concerts, the relationship between the two has become a friend from the cold classmates, and Lucien’s musical talent is obvious to all, later on music. The development can be imagined, so Felice, who also wants to take the music path, wants to maintain a good friendship with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a normal person, Felice can't deny that she has a guilty conscience about Lucien, but simply weigh the pros and cons, judge whether it is good or bad, and consider the future. Her kind-born people were educated from a young age to a big way of thinking, and Felice’s father finally failed to inherit the title, so that Fei Lisi avoided being overwhelmed by the enormous rights and companions’ flattery, so that she was blindly arrogant. And impulsive recklessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien discretion: "I have a good friend, John, who is a knight of Sir Wien, and is already a high-ranking person who can stimulate blood. Since my father’s call, I have been cared for by their family. When I had no power and money in the past, I could do my own thing with peace of mind and enjoy it all, but the success of the concert yesterday made me I got thirty-three Jintale's rich rewards, so I didn't sleep well all night. I thought about it for a long time. I decided to repay them first, otherwise I couldn't face the benevolent Lord and couldn't face myself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice heard the meaning of Lucien and had no doubts about his reasons: "You want to get the moonlight roses from me and help you." Good friends increase the success rate of stimulating blood power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the expression of Felice, quietly let out a sigh of relief: "Yes, this is The best reward I can make."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, The character I admire and love, goodness and so you do not forget the kindness of others to get along with people will be at ease and happy things. "Phyllis appreciate this may seem a bit out of character Lucien performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just this, Felice can’t be sure about Lucien’s character, but with the help of Mr. Victor, it’s definitely It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But praised Lu Xien, Felice also seriously said: "Moonlight Rose is only to help stimulate the blood, the most important thing is its own will and strength, you must know The aristocrat who uses 50 grams of moonlight rose and uses other materials to stimulate the blood, but the last three failed, is dozens of times the number of knights. If your good friend has the ability to stimulate blood, Sir Wien will not watch If you don't, you will definitely give him a certain amount of moonlight roses. You can use this money to make them live a better life. Lucien, do you really want to buy moonlight roses for him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she has a bitter taste, because she is one of these failed aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Felice was asking herself, but Lucien heard that she did not strongly resist the intention of buying moonlight roses for herself, so I was grateful. Zheng Zheng said: "I have inquired, generally this gift is only 10 grams, can prepare more moonlight roses, John's chances of successfully stimulating blood power is even higher. Even if it is only a little, I have to fight hard to fight for it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis suddenly laughed, maybe the psychological role at this time, Lucien felt that she had never been beautiful and beautiful: "No wonder Lucy Well, you can write a symphony of destiny that never gives up, well, how many grams do you want to buy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifty grams." Lucien measured His own financial resources, without hesitation, can be experimented several times, the grasp of the successful deployment of the "Crying Soul" potion is much greater, and full of gratitude, Felice is so good to speak, no requirements are raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their family has the closest relationship with the blood and legal relationship of Earl of Hein, the relationship and status are the worst. If it is not the rich legacy and arrangement of the old count, Felice’s father may have gone bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I buy as much as I can? I heard that Moonlight Rose can help people improve their coordination skills, so my piano playing level will increase rapidly. Silk, I will definitely remember your help." Lucien said that he had fabricated another reason, trying to make his eyes more sincere and sincere, and Moonlight Rose really has the effect of strengthening physical strength and strength, but coordination The improvement of ability has not been recognized, only rumors and cases in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis hands clasped, unconsciously doing the customary twisting action, flashing a lot of thoughts in my heart, if I just said that 10 grams of moonlight rose Mainly from the friendship relationship between the two people, the road to Sean wants extra moonlight, and Felice will have to look more at his future and the benefits he may bring to himself. Because this The effort required is very different, like a nobility who sponsors or invests in musicians, she needs to weigh the benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not urge, let Felice think carefully for a while, then Felice looked seriously at Lucien: "I can beg my father Buying 10 grams of moonlight roses, you can also let Yvette and Lafetti's Melissa help each other buy 10 grams from their family, a total of forty grams, no more. And, Lucien, you There is a price to pay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Felice does not have a title, the family status is not high, but as a member of the nobility, she is also a member of one of the three major families. Really want to do things, or can launch a huge force, this is the benefits of circle communication! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty grams...well, forty grams. Felice, what do you need me to do?" Lucien thought, this is already It is much stronger than 30 grams of his bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis smiled brightly: "The requirements are very simple, especially for your musical genius. First, the money to buy moonlight roses can't make me Come out; second, I hope that you can play a few songs as soon as possible. I will have my oyster party next month. I want to invite you to be a musical genius at a party. Third, I hope you can guide me to play. Piano, compose music, share your experience, and if I can write good music later, I hope to perform at your concert, or you can introduce my music to the Royal Highness Princess and other musicians, as well as the author comments. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing that the princess likes the piano very much, there is already a good level of Fili on the flute, ready to learn more than one instrument, and these three requirements Inside, no doubt, the most important thing is the third. Whenever new instruments are born or new music trends appear, always the musicians are the most inspiration, Felice hopes to pass Victor and Lucien. The guidance of a musician, as soon as possible to enhance their own inspiration Music's strength, to seize the rare opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she has no confidence in becoming a true disciple of Victor, naturally staring at Lucian, a classmate of music genius and princess music consultant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I swear to the Lord." Lucien saw this request, and he agreed to it without hesitation, and got the moonlight rose is the current center. The weight, while silently said, "As long as I have not left Aalto at the time. Even if I leave, I will make compensation before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Festive about the character of Lucien, Felice nodded: "A total of forty Jintales, give me two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two days... well, I wish Felice that you can finish it in two days. Here are thirty Jintales, the remaining ten, I want to return it to you in five months, can you? You? I know, I have the job of the Royal Highness Musician of the Princess." Lucian is a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job is very convincing, Felice let go of the twisted hand: "Then I will use the savings for you, don't let me go bankrupt." Ah, Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wallet that has been drummed has become dry, there are only three Jintales and the rest of the former Yinnar And the piecemeal copper fair, but Lucien sighed a long, not lost, but a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the best thing to be able to buy Moonlight Rose smoothly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not mixed into the music world, I’ve met Felice and others on the edge of the nobility circle, I’m afraid I’ll only go to the black market or the secret magic party to try to buy it. The hazard level is rising rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
