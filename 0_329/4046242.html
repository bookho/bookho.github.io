			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright and bright flowers are singing and swaying in the wind, setting off the pink and white buildings, and posing in a tightly closed room in the villa. There are several platforms that are engraved with different complex patterns. There are many devices such as reaction furnaces, glass bottles, black lines, ducts, etc., just a little more devilish than the experimental equipment that Lucien saw in his lifetime. From the mysterious magic runes on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black double-breasted long dress has become a simple robes that do not hinder the experiment. Lucien concentrates on launching several magical arrays of different parts of the simulated spell model. Through their combination, a group of red light and shadow emerged in the darkness and gradually stabilized. Although it is still very vague, it is faintly visible to be a mouse-like creature, and the temperature and color of each part are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien satisfactorily stopped the magic array and blew his whistle to light the lab's arc lamp. The darkness receded, and in that position there was a slap-up "house" made of masonry blocks, which was filled with a temporarily caught blood-transformed iron-rat mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The final calculation of 'Lu Xien's infrared light eye', but the effect can only achieve this, but it is also an additional means of exploration, and The magic that I constructed is only two rings." Lucien is clear about the principle of infrared imaging. The problem has always been how to map to the magical structure of patterns, runes, spells and so on. After a few months of study at the Magic Council, I finally had the ability to create formal magic, and I couldn't build apprentice-level magic as I used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the constructed spell model was memorized again, Lucien closed the arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, the swearing spells slowly sounded, and the shimmering "Sun Stone" powder slipped from Lucien’s hands, and the spirit followed the spell. The vibration changes and quickly relies on the control of Lucien to construct the core part of the spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Lucien’s black pupil in the left eye became red, reflecting the red image of the iron mouse in the cage, but clearly lacking layers sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s head turned, and the reddish left eye looked out of the house covered by black curtains, and saw a “red” bird flying by joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there is no problem with this second-ring magic, Lucien once again let the magic lab recover, the left eye is red, and it can be built when meditation at night. Into the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, each magician’s soul is limited in intensity, and the number of spell models that can be constructed at each level is not infinite, and you need to arrange magical collocations, such as auxiliary magic. You don't need to build into the soul, you need to use the spell, spell gestures, magic materials and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of books in the Magic Council that are similar to "Magic Matching Techniques" in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'Lu Xi's Infrared Eyes' as an auxiliary exploration magic, the scene used may be the assassin's attack, can be released earlier, It is crucial to find the trail of the assassin a little faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of rest, Lucien opens his magic notebook, flips to an unusually complex spell construction schematic, and closes his eyes to begin meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The destiny of the sky enveloped above, the wind and fire water formed around, one element of particles added bricks and tiles, which constitutes the meditation environment of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation environment, the particles of different colors move in accordance with various trajectories, as if the fireflies in the deep night glow with the flutter, they sometimes combine with each other. Sometimes scattered, full of mysterious and elusive taste, showing the mystery and laws between the elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End meditation, Lucien picks up the quill and draws some of the trajectories that he just sensed on the magic notebook, which make up a magical pattern and runes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the pen, Lucien looks at this perfection, and there are straight, curved, curved, and other seemingly real spell models, and the heart is full of doubts. This is the doubt that has always existed since the beginning of learning magic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can these magical figures and runes represent certain construction principles? Why can I release magic? Why do I have this structural figure in the meditation environment and the real world after I complete the periodic table? K, Lazar, Rock, they have accepted the periodicity of the element and map it into I have a meditation environment, but according to my inquiry, I have not resonated with the real world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recording his own questions and synchronizing to the magic notebook in the soul library, Lucien put down the quill and thought about the three-ring magic that was about to be constructed: "This magic is based on the periodicity of the elements, essentially It is to control their electronic exchange, let them return to their original position, and can effectively decompose the 'compounds' such as alchemical products, magic items, human body, and some magic. The more unstable the chemical state is, the easier it is to be decomposed, but its control. The force is increased with the level of the magician himself, which is equivalent to the weakened version of the 'Elemental Dominator' of the legendary magic of 'Elementalization' 'Decomposition'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After adding the will of the element, Lucien also read some core materials, which probably introduced the skills, conditions and materials needed for the advanced rituals of the "Elemental Dominator" and "Creator". The resulting two core legendary magical abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that before I became a mid-level magician, this three-ring magic can be constructed, and as long as it can be advanced, the first constructed spell model is It and flying. Well, what is the name, Lucan's elemental decomposition? Evans' elemental control? Either repeat, or not good." After thinking for a long time, Lucien thought of Florence. You get the domineering nickname: "It's called the element order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three-ring magic has this name that is comparable to the nine rings, legendary magic, Lucien The evil taste is greatly satisfied, and this is the signature of the surname of the "recognition of the professor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovering from joy, when Lucien was about to perform the next magic experiment, he suddenly found that most of the magic material was used up, and the mood suddenly became Frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few months, with the "Elemental" ring to enhance the magical effect of meditation efficiency, Lucien has successively purchased "white glycerin" and "silver pearl" The "Oak" three very low-level magicians are very good magical agents. The first two enhance the spirit and soul respectively, and the "Oak" with the "Florensa's Essence" achieves the best effect of a solid foundation, helping Lucien's magical power to increase rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, good results mean expensive, "white glycerin" is a small bottle of ten arcane points, "silver pearls" are twenty, "oak" It is eight, all three bottles a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth-level Arcanist and the second-ring magician. Lucy has to give 45 for the Arcane points every month. Expenses from the accumulated arcane points, plus Lucien's own magic analysis and release exercises require materials, learning materials for alchemy and potions, and magical experiments require materials and are very expensive - 'Lussin's infrared light The eye 'requires the high-order material of the sun stone before it is built into the soul, so in just five months, Lucien used more than half of the more than 2,760 arcane points, only one left. Thousand and a hundred "Arcane points are really difficult to go quickly." Lucien sighed at the empty glass bottle that stored the magic material, but he lamented that he was envious after being heard by Lazar a few days ago. Hate said for a long time, how can a normal two-ring magician use magical potions and magic materials so luxuriously, they usually spend up to fifty arcane points a month, which is still in the advanced situation, usually fifteen Point around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Lazar, Lucien has already lived in the life of the four-five ring magician in advance, how could he not spend money like water, of course, he I also admit that the fourth-level arcane master seems to be quite normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien converges on the mood, handles the magic lab environment, smiles and shakes his head: "There is a reward for paying, before the end of the arcane point, I There is hope that the third ring will become a mid-level magician, and then you can fly in the blue sky by your own strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you have to go to the magic tower of the headquarters. And the element will buy materials and potions from the Aringe branch, but fortunately the status of the four-level arcane master can be 20% cheaper, so that I will not be so heartbroken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s still until July 30th..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The city of the Holy City, the bottom of the Aalto Monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing in linen robes, with white feet and bare feet, Natasha silver purple eyes with purple long hair are as deep as an invisible ocean, calm The danger of extreme terror is brewing. More than a year of tight and painstaking life, she completely eliminated the aftermath of the explosive growth of blood, and steadily moved toward the seventh level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the room is dark, Natasha’s eyes seem to be able to see anything. She sits on the ground and is reading a letter from afar. Letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
