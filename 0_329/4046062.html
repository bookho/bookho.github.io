			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11:20 am, in the director's office on the third floor of the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello’s serious light gray eyes looked at Victor in front of him: “Victor, you should make a decision, for twenty minutes, can’t you pick Out of your satisfaction, they are the result of your musical inspiration for more than two decades."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor's face is pale and expressionless, sitting across from Othello On the chair, the table in front of him is full of music belonging to him, but his eyes are confused and there is no focal length. It is like looking at something else through these pieces, which may be the first piece in his life. The instrumental violin may also be a gloomy cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing Othello’s words, his lips twitched slightly and said with difficulty: “Can you think about it again? Othello’s director.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf with him sitting across from Othello, he smiled with great irony: "Think about it, can you think of a better piece?" Victor, well, don't push it anymore. Maybe you think there is a good piece in the mediocre work? Don't waste the time of Othello's director. He is waiting for lunch with His Royal Highness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello nodded and took out a pocket watch and looked at it: "His Royal Highness invited me to lunch for a whole time, the time from the association to the Lata Summer Palace. It was fifteen minutes, but the rainstorm last night has not stopped until now. There are serious waters in many places. It needs to be bypassed. At least ten minutes should be set in advance. Before that, I will take a nap for one hour to prevent fatigue. Let me lose my grace. Victor, you don't have much time, in the last ten minutes, you are like Still not sure, let Wolfe replace you. He has just been invited by the Count of Lafayette to have a concert. There is no problem with the band."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lata Summer Palace is the court of the Vaurit Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf’s eyes reveal extreme enthusiasm and desire. With his own relationship with the nobility, as long as he can hold a concert in the hall, just There was no big problem in the concert, and he could go further on the music road. After that, he was likely to become the director of the association. He took a deep breath and looked at Victor: "Victor, I don't want to take away your performance opportunities, but For the association, you have to make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor regained his gaze, staring at the score on the table for two minutes, then extending his right finger Sheet music: "Let's just about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simple action and such a simple sentence seems to take the time out of Victor's strength and let him fall over the chair But, once the decision was made, Victor was full of disappointment and unwillingness, but his heart still felt a little relaxed, at least not having to spend all his energy and burning souls to think about new music, which afflicted himself for nine years. Still not finished . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this is a good thing, not going to sleep every night because of torture." Victor numb and desperately thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello took a clap with satisfaction: "Victor, you can make a decision, I am very happy, but your mental state has some problems, if before the concert I can't recover, I have some potions to help you, but it will have a little impact on your health. Well, let's go out, I have to take a nap for an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wolf took a deep disappointment and walked outside the office with Victor, who seemed to have difficulty walking. When the wooden door closed, he looked at Victor with a hateful look: "Let's enjoy your last time." Let's not let your lady be disappointed in Paradise Hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Victor can't accept others to attack themselves with their own lady Look at Wolfe angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf spread his hand, his nose snorted, and screamed: "Why look at me? It will be you, not me, who will disappoint your wife." Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he sneered and left, and Victor seemed to have been hit, killing his face and squatting on the ground, waiting for him to wait. Lott, Felice, and Herodotus panicked and quickly picked him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go to the lounge to calm down and practice all the music in the afternoon," Victor said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving Victor’s home, Lucien held an umbrella and ran in the heavy rain, and the rain blew into the umbrella with the wind. Wean Lucian’s clothes were wet again, and the weakness of Lucien’s unrecoverable was obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few pedestrians and carriages on the road filled with white water mist caused by heavy rain, so that Lucien can run very fast without having to Worried about the obstacles, the problem is that after running for a distance, Lucien had to stop and gasp because of the weakness of the body, because the wind blew the umbrella and obstructed Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe a few minutes later, you can stop the list before sending it to Princess Natasha." Lucien bypassed the deep waters. On the street flooded to the ankle, I walked slowly and gasped, and continued to run after the breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the running, Lu Xi’s umbrella was blown back by the strong wind, so that he could not hold the umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The clothes are all wet anyway." Without hesitation, Lucien put the umbrella away, clipped it inside the arm, let it fall to the body with heavy rain. Fly fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, without the obstacles of the umbrella, Lucien ran rampant in the heavy rain and the speed became faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by doing their best, can you not regret it, Lucien’s persistence, struggle, persistence, and obstinacy have all been fully revealed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bean-sized rain hits the face and has a slightly painful feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally twenty minutes or more before you can reach the Musicians Association from the Victor home However, Lucien only took six minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve forty-one, outside the door of the Musicians’ Association, Lucien’s hands on his knees, his back bowed, gasping, wet The hair was stuck on the face, and the drops of water ran down the pattern on the rock outside the gate. The clothes were completely drenched and looked very heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little relaxation, Lucien pushed the door open and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena was shocked to see Lucien’s appearance, and came out from behind the wooden cabinet: “Lu Xien, is the rain outside so big? Are you so wet with an umbrella?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. Elena, where is Mr. Victor?" Lucien asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena thought for a moment: "It should be in his lounge. I saw Felice going upstairs with lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Lucien handed the umbrella to Elena and thanked him, and hurriedly turned to the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena looked strangely at Lucian’s back: “What is so hot?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weak Lucian climbed the stairs in a difficult and fast way. After a minute, he went to Victor’s lounge and slammed it. door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to open is Lott, his face is very bad, seeing Lucien just nodded and no doubt about coming over to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked into the lounge and saw Victor sitting at his desk, as if he had lost all his enthusiasm and hope, buried his face in his hands, knocking on someone The door didn't react, like a painting that lost color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Felice, Herodotus, and the Rhine who heard about this incident, are sitting on the sofa next to each other, silently The simple lunch was still the same, and it was not reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Victor confirmed the list of music?" Lucien asked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lott, Felice and Herodotus did not have the mood to answer, only the Rhine nodded: "Yes, use the original piece of music." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a little hope for things. Lucien is in a hurry, not too discreet in tone and wording, seemingly weak, and some words are too straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you written the music?" Herodotus heard the words of Lucien in disappointment and anger, and it was good and angry. Funnyly asked, this guy is still crazy in this serious and sad atmosphere! No one is a surname! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Felice’s beautiful ruby-like pupil looked at Lucien with anger, clearly indicating her dissatisfaction and anger. It’s not a mess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lott came over and prepared to open Lucien, not letting him stimulate Mr. Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor didn’t seem to hear a word from Lucien’s front. The weak, tired voice came out of the palm of his hand: “Useless, ten minutes ago, Orsay Luo Li went to Lata Summer Palace to have lunch with His Royal Highness Princess. It was impossible to change the track. There is no hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things can't be changed?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien heard that Othello had gone to Latava, and suddenly he had a huge frustration and was easily opened by Lott from the desk. : "Lu Xien, don't play with your cleverness, be quiet, be quiet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a serious sense of defeat, Lucien always felt There is still hope that if you try harder, you should have hope. So when you are backed by Lottra, you eagerly and earnestly said: "Mr. Victor, try again, you should be able to change the track! The rain is so big. It is possible to catch up with Othello's director!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Of no use. "Balderdash wildly Victor whispered, my head without looking up, it seems to have no power to support themselves, only despair at the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he feels that Lucian is going crazy and behaving, he is so sincere, trying so hard, still let Lott, Felice, Herodo Morality produces the same feelings, but when things are already doomed and fate has been arranged, they have a deep sense of powerlessness, like Victor, who blames Lucien for being weak:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think about it again, Lucien, although we also want to fight, but it is useless, we can only give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "All at this time, Othello's director may have arrived at Lata Summer Palace, useless, Lucien, give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even The Othello director has not arrived yet, how long does it take to write a new piece of music? Playing the current track may also be successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of disappointment In the middle, Lucien stepped back a few steps and only felt that she was very tired, very disappointed and blamed: "Maybe it is really life." Arrangement, let me get a leave of absence, if..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not my business anyway, failure will fail." Being infected with frustration, Lucien It also seems to be like other people in the lounge, without color, just a gloomy. But now, Lucien remembered Victor’s care and care for himself in the past few months, remembering his three weeks of worship, full of expectations, no Slacking piano practice, remembering the persistence and not giving up when he braved the storm, and then seeing Victor's state as if he were dead, seeing the disappointment of Lott, Felice and others, but without any expression of changing the result, Lucy There is a stronger emotion in the heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s deeply unwilling, you have done so much preparation and hard work, can you accept it with peace of mind? Such a result? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an idea that I still want to give it a try, why should I complain about what has happened, not to fight for the present and the future? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is no matter how big the obstacles and troubles are, we must face, overcome, and grasp the belief of hope, how can we give up now? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a deep breath and looked around the lounge and found the piano. This is because the new instruments of Victor and Rhein have transformed the piano. So one of the gifts given by the association, it is just an ornament in the lounge, showing Victor's role in this instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?! Lucien!" Lott and Herodotus yelled angrily at the same time, and Felice stood up and walked behind Lucien because she was closest to the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Rhine is curious and funny looking at Lucian’s move, what time can there be music for three weeks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not speak, with strong emotions, pressed his hands heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Dangdang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightening, powerful and powerful notes sounded in the lounge, Victor's hands trembled, did not support his head, the whole person jerked, sitting Straight up, look at the direction of the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice, Lott, and Herodotus trembled, staying in the same place, remembering to stop Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, as the stormy follow-up string began to appear with the play of Lucien, it was fast, intense and shocking. Such chords are continuous, like unrelenting suffering, like the huge waves in the sea, like the horns and tide-like enemies on the battlefield, without giving any breathing space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally there is a small, soothing string, but it often leads to a more intense, more desperate, more difficult situation, seems to be a brief calm before death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But facing this huge difficulty, in the face of this deep setback, no one gave up, they are fighting hard, fighting heroically, It’s so tense and heart-rending. It’s like a huge wave of rolling sea. All the sailors of a fishing boat are struggling to squat with the sails, fighting with the harsh environment, floating up and down without overturning, as if the blood splashed. On the battlefield of the corpse of the land, one by one, the squares face the overwhelming arrows and the spears, and the people in front fell, and the people behind them added, and they still maintained a neat queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shocking string of temperament, let Felice, Lott, and Herodotus slammed, full of doubts and stunned look at Lucien On the side, watching him still lingering on the face of the water, and the Rhine stood up and seemed unable to suppress the emotions in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gnaws his teeth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why give up? Why give up? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also catch up with Baron Othello. Even if you can’t catch up, you can go to Princess Natasha to ask for a change, even if she doesn’t agree, she can still use music. Charm to convince her, why give up? Why give up? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a little hope, you can't give up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions are integrated into the music, the first movement of the Symphony of Destiny is getting more and more intense, so that the people who stop next to Lott and Felice can’t stand it. Stayed trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is fate that lets you give up, or do you give up on yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fate to defeat you, or is it difficult and frustrating to defeat you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of fierce, shocking stringing like a sharp arrow pierced Victor’s heart, letting him consciously straighten up, thinking that this is the Lord’s torture Be yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien played fast with his hands, his emotions and music resonated, and then became more intensely infected by music, remembering his ups and downs in a few months: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want a calm life, want a warm family, want to love my parents and loved ones, but inexplicably come across, lose everything, full of pain, but also Seeing that the witch was burned to death, forced to go to the sewer adventure;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to learn the words, want a better life, but be blocked by the gang, beaten by them; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to study magic quietly, but here is Aalto, the church’s powerful Aalto, I can only risk my life, Keep walking on the edge of darkness and light, and face death again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave up? Did I give up? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
