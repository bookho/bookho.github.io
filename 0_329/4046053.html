			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor’s reputation and status in the music industry and in the eyes of the nobility is directly related to the achievements and life of Lott, Felice and others, so they cannot maintain The elegant and graceful style emphasized by the nobles is full of troubles, worries, and bitter expressions on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis clasped her hands and squatted back and forth outside the piano door, and looked at the closed wooden door from time to time, after hearing about Lott’s words. Some can't control the emotions, and the voice is slightly sharp: "How to persuade? Do you tell Mr. Victor that you calm down, there will be inspiration? The new music must be written? If ordinary persuasion has a role, then Mr. Victor How could this be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lott frowned and looked at the wooden door of the piano room: "Maybe persuade Mr. Victor, why must I use the newly written music? Mr. Victor has had many excellent symphonies before, and he can choose one from the inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this crucial concert, Victor has already I wrote two new pieces of music, and carefully selected one of the past to represent the highest level of the past, which is comparable to the new one, and the current symphony is a strict four-page structure. , the length of the music is often in the dozens of points , A concert only need to prepare four symphonies on the line, so Victor worse last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have advised the lord, but he said that the two new pieces of music are the crystallization of his musical soul and inspiration. The previous symphony has only one At the same level, picking another one will only lower the style and level of the entire concert, become an unavoidable and criticized and criticized, so he totally disagrees." Butler Ais does not know when It appeared near the stairs, and the old face looked very helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herodod licked his forehead: "It’s Mr. Victor’s pursuit of perfection. In fact, his previous symphony was very good, being a lot of nobility and music. I admire it, otherwise how would I invite him to the Shengsheng Hall to hold a concert? Let’s persuade us to persuade it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at Lott and Fili Silk, asking for their opinions, as for Lucien, he was neglected by his meaning. One was only able to learn music for less than two months, and he could only play the very poor music of the poor boy. On this, there is nothing to say. right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not know how to persuade, because it is obvious that Mr. Victor has devoted all his soul and enthusiasm to this concert. It is not at all that others can persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ace, what do you think?" Felice knew very well that in someone at the venue, what Mr. Victor knows best is to accompany him close. Thirty years ago, watching his child from the early ten years step by step to become the musician's steward Ace, so he looked at Ace with concern and concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ace shook his head, full of sentimentality and regret: "Master will not listen to your persuasion, this concert is very important to him, on the one hand is involved The status of the music industry and the future development, on the one hand, is the wish of the lady. The wife has been very sorry before she passed away. She did not see the grandfather holding a concert in the Shenglu Hall, so the lord wanted a perfect, flawless music. Yes, hey, I hope that my grandmother will calm down when I think of my wife’s expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we can't do nothing." Felice has the possibility to become the wife of a nobleman. Lott has already regarded the development of music as the only direction of his future, and it is inevitable that he is as restless as Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien was always grateful to Victor, and nodded in the same way: "Maybe we can find some medicines and foods that help sleep and calm emotions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magic apprentice, the most important thing to think about is the magic, the pharmacy. Lucien shows this very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the lord specifically told me not to let him take similar pharmacy, because it will suppress inspiration and thinking." Ace seriously and solemnly vetoed Lucifer Pro's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was slightly worried about the authenticity: "Can you only expect Mr. Victor to defeat himself? Can we do nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do? Can you still write a symphony instead of Mr. Victor?" Herodotus, who hated Lucien, was very annoyed and couldn't help but sneer with anger. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet for a while, the door of the piano room slammed, and Victor came out, his eyes were deep, and he said with deep exhaustion: "I went to the association to practice the first three pieces of music. You follow, how is the band learning? Under the command, and then practice your own instrument in the piano room of the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a brief crash, Victor quickly recovered. Come over, Lott and Felice and others are quietly sighing. It seems that they do not necessarily need to wait for others to do anything. Mr. Victor is a great musician who has played and seen the world in various courts. Know how to adjust, but the haze of whether the fourth symphony can be successfully reproduced remains in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the performance hall on the fifth floor, the band is in the command of Victor, Under the coordination of the chief of the Rhine, a symphony piece was played in a complete and beautiful manner. The four movements are solemn, grand, and rigorous in structure, and with the taste of some religious music, giving a very wonderful hearing enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the symphony ended, Victor went to the front of Lucian and others who were listening and observing under the stage: "Okay, you go to the piano." Let's practice, I will wait for guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished, Lucien and others have not turned, suddenly there is a round of applause in quiet play The hall sounded, although the hall structure is special, there is a very good echo effect, but the applause is too thin, it still seems sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very good symphony, I can't think of just coming back for a while, I can enjoy such a beautiful piece of music. It seems that Victor's concert is ready? Oh, it will be very successful." In the words of praise, it is a mocking smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened to this familiar voice, looked back, it really turned out to return to Wolf, his boots like a chin raised high, a pair The look of the toes is high and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor’s face sank and looked at Wolf’s performance, apparently what he had heard: “Wolf, it seems that you accepted the invitation this time, and harvested Big?" He didn't want to mention the preparations for the concert that made him annoyed, so there was no positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Wolf can let him go, and after knowing the state of Victor’s recent period from other people, Wolf can guess without guessing, Victor’s The music preparation was definitely a big problem, so I found it directly: "Victor, last time you didn't want me to listen to your music, put forward some opinions? I thought about it, everyone is a musician of Aalto, There is nothing that can't be eliminated, so I decided to promise you. Well, play the four pieces in full."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Victor has thoroughly understood Wolfe came over and laughed at himself, but he was going to be angry. Two people came in outside the hall. One was a silver-haired old man, wearing a black dress and carrying a black cane, serious and old-fashioned. The other is a handsome young man with a bright blond hair, which is what McCain has seen in Lucien, Lott's cousin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cycle of Othello." Both Victor and Wolfe put their emotions on and greeted the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed the ceremony, and secretly said: [It turned out that he is the director of the Musicians Association, the teacher of McCann, the Baron Othello. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aristocratic legal provisions that have been formed for a long time, it is not the descendants of the blood that can inspire the inheritance, but only those who have the same inheritance rights, the strength of the knight Naturally, it is better than others, and Othello is the kind of person who has not inspired the blood, but has inherited the title because he is the only son. However, he has a good musical talent, is good at serious works, and is touted by several companions. It soon became a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victor, I heard that your fourth piece of music has not yet been written?" Othello went to Victor and asked with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor frustrated and nodded: "Yes, Othello's governor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osloyan The stick in the hands of Yang: "Victor, this is a concert held in the Hall of the Holy Ghost. It is played under the Grand Duke and under the Princess Hall. You must not have any problems. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I understand, Othello, I have been working hard." Victor answered with a low mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
