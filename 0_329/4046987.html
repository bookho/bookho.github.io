			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando, bathed in the moonlight, walked towards Tucker’s dilapidated villa, trying to think from the perspective of the trapped Archmage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, the object of help must be cautious. If you choose a magician trapped in the city for help, it is easy to expose the line. After all, it is not. I can reason about the real situation like me. If I am a little careless, I will be discovered by the mysterious chaser or the legendary master of surveillance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It was confirmed by Fernando from the beginning. For the Archmage who was trapped here, there were few opportunities for help, and there was no waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he choose me, not Tucker, not other magicians? Where are our similarities and differences?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando believes that he must have some advantage in order to escape the trapped Master. He will be chosen by him and venture into the dream for help. Therefore, he intends to find this through comparison to determine his own action plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking that the opponent is a legendary lord, Fernando is both scared and excited, and his thinking is running faster than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a high-level magician of the Seventh Ring, Tucker is a six-ring, the gap is not big, there is no significant advantage, and, I am at Cofrey. The city has not cast high-level spells. The trapped Master will definitely not judge my true strength. That is to say, strength is not the reason for his choice. Well, when faced with legendary magicians, high-level strength is of no use. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My wisdom? I came from Holm, this trapped Master even knows me, I don't know if I am good at thinking and "#" not much. The Master who can hide under the eyes of the legendary magician is even rarer, and there are not many Masters who are good at magical field spells. Several conditions are combined, and only one Master is in compliance with the standard. That is the classmate of Antec. He has already recognized the world's semi-solidified Stanis, who is about to become the "king of the king of nightmare", and just that he is not in Aalto, time and strength are right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not surprising that Stanis heard about it from Antec’s mouth, but this kind of listening is obviously very broad. It’s not enough for Stanis to choose me intelligently. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is isolated from the outside world, and my connection with Antec and Fran is not used..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando was a bit puzzled for a moment, and he really didn’t understand why Steinness entrusted such important things to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I used a morphed belt and also became a fame, I have never seen me before, I can’t recognize me..." Fernando suddenly remembered I am now a girl orchid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this question, he quickly relieved, in the "Mage's official residence", he asked for the whereabouts of Tucker. I made a more detailed registration, indicating that I came from the Holm area, called Lando, and the guaranteed magician is Antec and Fulan. Combining this information, Stanis can be based on the description of Antec's past. Probably guessing that I am Fernando, but it has become a woman for a while. After all, Antec’s friends can count clearly in one hand, and even fewer from the Holm area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, it may be that he is hiding in a secret place of the magistrate's official residence. The most dangerous place is the safest place...唔, exclude Out of strength, wisdom and other factors, what is more suitable for others than others to help him out of trouble? Color lure? Ha ha." Fernando did not want to rule out this possibility, whether it is a legend, or a strong nine. I can't even touch my face, what do I use to seduce? Besides, with their strength, what kind of beauty has not seen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will it be? What will it be... Fernando pacing back and forth outside the dilapidated villa, looking for the biggest difference between himself and others. It is also easy to describe a place that is easy to impress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he stepped his feet and his eyes rounded out: "If I am Antec, it will definitely describe my friend Fernando, wretched, violent, eager, and very mouthful. Poisonous, easy to offend people, start temper to growl like thunder..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristics of uselessness fade away, "urgent" The words emerged in Fernando's heart: "Perhaps, only a violent character, an eager magician, can create opportunities for Stanis to get out of trouble, at least, he thinks so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The eager eager magician will not wait, will choose to be unprepared, and forcefully go out... In this case, if the monitor is caught off guard, the attention will be attracted, or the defensive magic array will be excited, and this I gave Staniss a short chance... Well, since he dared to escape here, it shows that 'King of the Nightmare' is one of the legends involved in this research. Stamnis may have any way to contact this short-term relaxation. To the secret of the 'King of the Nightmare',<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Fernando has a feeling that he is Stanis, just as the two sides did not meet, but I can grasp each other's minds at the same time!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, I may be vented with anger, and if there is a problem with the surveillance legend, I can definitely catch up." Killing Stanis in front of the 'King of the Nightmare' and fleeing directly, what is his grasp of this danger? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Fernando always wonders, can only choose to believe in Stanis, he must know more than himself.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I don't take this risk anyway, Antec and Fulan just want to be close, then I have no chance of taking risks, I will definitely be killed, even if I die, I have to die." On the way to leave! Fernando secretly made up his mind and then grinned. "This is really the choice of a violent eager wizard..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is as poisonous as himself. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you have to observe tomorrow if you can't get in and out, so you don't have to be fooled." "Fernando is not someone who believes what others say.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Tucker’s villa had a night, Fernando pretended to be a searcher and turned to visit the city. No accidental discovery, no one really went out of town! The carriage that delivers food and food will change the coachman at the gate of the city!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After surely. Fernando quietly took a breath and looked at the hard work of carrying water and food in front of him. He decided to start immediately, and the monitors and cultists thought they would go back. When you are ready, go straight!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick silver-white lightning in the sky Light up, squatting directly on the gate of the city, and the magical light circulates, and the stone is broken.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Fernando’s space is distorted, countless Runes gather into a dazzling gate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic Transfer"!<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the whole city suddenly glows, and the magic symbols and patterns are highlighted to create a layered magic array.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment when the magic array was just excited, the "Mage's official residence" rose up and became a foggy group, connected with the magic array.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city is awkward, and everyone can't see the place in front of the meter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando only feels the ups and downs, and it is difficult to contain it before the messy transmission. I slept in the past.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to open your eyes. Fernando feels again. The existence of the body, just as he was delighted that he was still alive, a beautiful and quiet beauty appeared in front of his eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fran, you are here. ? Fernando subconsciously said hello, but when he just exported, he felt wrong. Why is the voice of a man!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is not as beautiful as the same The character oil painting, once opened, forms a strong contrast, and her eyes smile coldly: "How? Feeling surprised that the chick became a man? You are a pervert, actually become a woman to lie to me, and go to bed with me! "The more she said, the more she gnashed her teeth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this is a misunderstanding..." Fernando suspected that he was identified by the Fran when he was lethargic, and then Removed its effect.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
