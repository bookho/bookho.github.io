			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the streets, people come and go, Oliver stone statues stand in the center, and are incompatible with the surrounding environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teenager, although he is genius above the drama, experienced in some aspects, and has a far-reaching experience, but the situation is still more than The limit he can bear, this is the cost of living in the next few months! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? What should I do when I eat? What should I do when I sleep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless questions that rush into his mind with the emotions of anger and frustration, letting him only feel the darkness of the sunny afternoon, the crowds around Alien and alienated, as if the two sides are not in the same world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Oliver broke out with a shocking passerby Howling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While screaming, his right hand clasped the suitcase, for fear that another thief would emerge and take the last possession away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the contempt, laughter, and madness of the crowd, Oliver vented his heart, calmed down for a while, and seriously thought about how he should live. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, calm, Oliver, you have talent, appearance, strength, and certainly can overcome this difficult." Oliver whispered himself, brain Quickly turning, trying to find a way to deal with similar dilemmas from his own experience, and what he sees most is a drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right right, this time, I need to find someone who appreciates me, my new life will start from there." He found the experience from the drama. , Kickboxing, "Oliver, your most precious possession is not just the wallet, it is your mind. It is a drama script in your suitcase. Just take them and go to the drama association to find a gentleman who appreciates it. You can immediately exchange it. To a generous reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a way for Oliver to restore the spirit of the young man, find a few thick stacks of paper from the trunk, tight They squatted on them and asked what they were going to do when they thought about making money: elegant and luxurious villas, nice looking maids, exquisite delicious food, famous wines worth cherishing. Beautiful hot lover. And, and, "I want to ask someone to kill the damn thief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alam Street where the Theatre Association is located is not far from the gate, Oliver will soon see It was a unique building that was supported by gray pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the mercenary guarded at the door. The footsteps paused. I remembered one of the most commonly used bridges in the drama. That is because the protagonist is wearing a tattered, shabby appearance, and the goalkeeper is proud to refuse. Therefore, it has to be more tortuous and more sorrowful to achieve the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't make such a mistake." Oliver felt that he was too smart, and thought of this in time, so he went to the nearby square and walked. The smooth mirrored pool combed the hair that had become messy when it was vented, and then took out a black turtleneck coat from the suitcase to replace the dusty clothes. At the end, he took out a white handkerchief and folded it into Flower-like appearance, inserted into the chest pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elegant gentleman." Oliver nodded with satisfaction and returned to the theater association door with his suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the door, he did not squint, but when the two mercenaries stopped, he snorted as if he was condescending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two mercenaries were confused by his calm attitude and excellent appearance. He thought that he was a noble gentleman, so he did not dare to stop and slowly returned to the original. Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, Oliver, you are great! It will be successful!" Oliver praised himself, speeding up and entering the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello! I tell you, I will be the greatest playwright in the future! You can't be so rude!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Oliver was framed by two big men, throwing him straight down the steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrogant madman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men screamed and threw Oliver’s suitcase and manuscript down. Hey, the suitcase landed open. The clothes flew out and the manuscripts were swelled like snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the page of the manuscript of his own treasure, flying in front of him, falling on his face, falling into the dust, Oliver suddenly became stunned, then Angrily shouted: "You will regret it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My young drama genius is sure to make a big business! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s sad and painstakingly packed up, and Oliver wanders aimlessly on the street, not knowing what he can do, not knowing where he can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To find a place to shelter from the rain tonight, go to the town hall, pub and other places tomorrow to see if you can find a thing to do." Oliver sees The dark clouds began to smear, so I returned to my heart from depression, and gnashed my teeth: "I know how to write poetry, I will write words, and I am afraid of starving in Lentat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly reinvented his confidence and found a prominent eaves, hiding underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, heavy rain fell, splashing white mist on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver looked at this scene in a daze, and suddenly he was happy: "My experience today will be the source of my future drama creation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the pain blew on Oliver’s head, and he turned hard and saw a tramp staring at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is mine!" He pointed to the eaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s accumulated anger broke out today, and it was a young man’s heart, so he roared and said: “I’m taking it for me!” I rushed up, and The tramp beat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his expression solidified and his eyes lost his look. It turned out that he was behind a tramp and gave him a head with a wooden stick. one strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness, blood, pain, cold, always entangled Oliver, so that he could not get rid of this unimaginable painful situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all his efforts, Oliver slammed over and sat up, his eyes receding, revealing a dim candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, where is this?" He looked at the simple, narrow cabin and said that he felt a burning pain in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home." The cold male snoring sounded, the door leading to the inside opened, and a chunky and sturdy bald wicked came out, "You have been Sold to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Oliver jumped out of bed unbelievably, and was knocked over by the evil man on the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call the boss. Do you understand?" The bald-headed singer screamed with force. "Close your mouth and listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver was beaten up and down, touched the swollen corner of his mouth, and looked at the bald-headed man with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald-headed snoring snorted: "You are a foreigner, have no money and no strength, actually dare to conflict with the local tramp, hey, they take you After stunning, I took your clothes and sold you to me. Starting today, you are my men, and you will be free when you give the labor equal to the money I give."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evil man doesn't seem too bad... Oliver squinted: "What are we doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The corpse." The bald wicked is somewhat disgusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is just bright. The bald-headed George took Oliver to the mortuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here are the bodies that have no relatives or no money. We are responsible for burying them in the new cemetery. The reward is given by the church and the city hall." Opening the door, the rotten corpse smelled out immediately, letting Oliver, who had never been in contact before, retching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
