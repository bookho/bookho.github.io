			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think there is anything that has a natural cycle name. Stars can appear in different positions in the night sky because they are gravitational. Fixed track, what is the cycle last name of that element? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s low and serious voice echoed in the hall, asking the essence of the problem that every arcian was blinded by past experience and became less A keen mind, yeah, why do elements have a cycle name? This question is like how ordinary people walk on the earth instead of floating in the air!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a little bit of the field that could open the horror box, Lucien received it and showed a gentle smile before the arcaneists reacted: "I just came into contact with the arcane and the current magic. Those who can only ask questions and do not have enough knowledge and ability to explore the problem, I hope that the forerunners on the magical road can gain something. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any cognitive change needs to be subtle. Lucien can't want to see the heads of most of the members of the backing organization that he just found, one after another, though Imagine the most exaggerated picture is very sensation: I spoke on it, and the following members of the hostile forces suddenly yelled at the sky, then the head exploded, and then a few words, and some hostile personnel vomited blood to explode... and thus won.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lavin before him is the first to applaud. He is very rare and grumpy. "You are a rare and not stupid question." Although your speech is short, it is the most valuable part of today's meeting, which may be a new research direction in the field of elemental magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Raven, the arcaneists expressed their respect with applause, this time the "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference" is their harvest Most often!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Evans, what's the problem you will talk about tomorrow. I want to refine my collection of magic ore that matches my predicted surname, and hope to add enough weight to the correctness of the periodic table. After Ravendi finished speaking, there was no answer to the line of Sean’s answer, and he received his own alchemy lodge and went to the single-family villa behind the manor to feel at ease.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gasdong, Avery, Timothy, Larry and other arcane masters all stood up, can't wait to leave and leave, put in magic experiments, want to verify the periodic table by refining the magic ore on the body Correct.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be invited to participate in the "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference", they have more or less love for arcane and magic research, and This will be a feat that can be recorded in the annals of history.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leandru also excused himself to experiment and leave in a hurry to avoid Lucien.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than five minutes, the arcane masters who came to the meeting in the hall were all gone, leaving only Lucien standing alone on the stage.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These arcs and gentlemen are able to achieve something, with them against arcane and magic Like, put inseparable. Lazare walked over with deep emotions, and this scene left a deep impression on him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, what he has experienced today has been left for him. I was deeply impressed!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien smiled and replied: "A person can be smart enough, but must not be lazy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level magicians in the distance, such as Rebecca, are undoubtedly focused on this side, and they are not familiar with Lucien. Sorry to come, can only incorporate your admiration, curiosity, envy and surprise into your eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So only I share the joy of success with you, the road Sean, congratulations, I seem to see a new Holm Crown Award winner. Lazar felt that he had the vision to identify talents and to give a hug to congratulate Lucien.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xinmo squats: "Things are not yet Final conclusion. By the way, Lazar, don't know where there is a magic laboratory? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what do you want to do? Lazar asked in confusion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled at him: "Of course, I continue to experiment, I can buy a lot of magic ore." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lucian's back disappeared on the stairs, Lazar looked at his own hands: "This guy, I want to celebrate with him, and I left me directly, I got into the magic lab." You are not destined to be liked by girls!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazar, can you tell us about Mr. Evans?" Just turned back and pulled Zar saw Rebecca and other beautiful female surnames, low-level magicians, slightly blushing and inquiring about Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but yell: "Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Dangao When the technicians were basically experimenting, someone took the opportunity to send a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a magic tower in Aringe, Rogerio looked carefully at the information in his hand and then threw it on the desk, some Annoyed and angrily: "What am I doing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the periodic table is a summary of the results of the induction, Rogerio is no doubt about the road Sean’s level problem, he has indeed been verifying the elemental surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible to arrange not only to find out which element of the element will be in close contact with the middle-level arcian, but to allow him to accept the will of the element of light in a bright and honest manner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that he actually made a research result that has both a sensation and an important surname. Kind of effect? Rogerio faintly feels that this achievement will probably promote the rapid development of the will of the element! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question of the atomic weight of the Temiric elements that he has determined, Rogerio is not in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio closed his eyes and opened: "It’s an arcane genius, but without this potential, the professor won’t accept him. Student. Ador, you don't have to follow up and monitor Evans. He has such a result. Who knows if it will be secretly observed by the Arcanists. If you find you, Hathaway can never be soft. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead Adolph next to him laughed and said: "It doesn't mean to keep track of a little guy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The sky is bright, and Lu Xien, who hasn’t slept for a long time, gets up and goes to the manor’s main house hall, where many arcane masters have gathered, and they look a little tired, obviously There is no rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, how? Is there any gain?" Lazar, who had come up early to clean up the venue, asked. If there is something to gain, as a friend, he is both happy and glory, and it seems that Lucien will become a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "My magical strength is too bad, I can only rely on the magical laboratory's alchemy array, magic array and equipment, etc. Not a few experiments, nothing was found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, me too." Another arcane teacher came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing arcane and magical research issues that are not involved in secrets is the best way for arcaneists to become familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Gaston, Avery, Larry, Timothy and others came one after another, and the Arcanists took a seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Leandre didn’t want to arrange it, he added Lucien to the second row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a long time, Lavendi and Ulysses have not yet appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists look back from time to time, which makes them a little anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Mr. Ravendi and Ulysses have been experimenting for too long last night." Gaston got up and smiled to appease the emotions of other arcans. “It’s better for us to send someone to remind Mr. Ladvin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians who talked were quiet, whether they bothered Mr. Raven’s experiment or his Sleep, I am afraid I have to be prepared to face his roaring roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdong sees no one should accept, the low-level magicians around the meeting are subconsciously retreating, even if they have been attached to the wall, so they laugh Shaking his head, on the road to Xi'an: "Evans, you go up and talk about how to find the periodicity of the elemental cycle, we are slowly waiting for the arrival of Mr. Ravendi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, I found the silicon-like element you predicted, the atomic weight, the surname, etc. exactly match!" He followed Ulysses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗, as if there was strong light illuminating the entire conference hall, the arcaneists only felt that the eyes were exceptionally bright, and the discovery of this new element completely eliminated the monstrous The shadow on the periodic table of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, the warm and continuous applause sounded, applauding for a shocking element of magic and shocking the world of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause is hard to calm down, and Gaston’s three consecutive gestures of pressing down make the scene a bit quieter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the hall and deliberately stayed on the face of Leandru for a while, then screamed: "I think there should be no more doubts about the Evans Periodic Table of Elements. The correct surname! I have already thought about how to evaluate his thesis, and I will submit it to the Arcane Review Committee after I have done a new element discovery experiment by Mr. Ravendi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then he smiled and looked at Lucien: "Evans, or talk about your experience of the periodicity of the elemental cycle, I think everyone is very curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is agitated and excited, walked to his seat and sat down, nodded and wanted to hear this memorable story, but the middle of the "Elemental" journal review of the Arcane division Ignatius was nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said that he had experimented with mastering the surname of the element, arranged the cards, found the problem, and so on. Finally, he began to talk about the difficulty of submitting the manuscript: "After the review, I want to get more discussion from the Arcanists, so I don't go to the "Arcane" journal headquarters to submit the manuscript. The result is that the auditor is evaluated as a mistake, and I don't know how to pass the assessment." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idiots! Only take the brain when you dine!" Lavin rudely insulted all the auditors of the "Arcane" journal. . However, even if the arcane masters are in front of them, they can only laugh and dare not be angry. This is only half a step into the highest ranking group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued: "I later submitted the article to the "Elements" journal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; All the auditors in the "Elements" journal were nervous, fearing that they would be snarled by Lavindi, especially Ignatius's hands became a little trembling, and his face turned white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the "Elements" journal has not yet made a decision to increase the length, they suggested to include my paper in the next issue." Lucien is "Elements" The journal was decorated with a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not that stupid," Lavin said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, as if there were more than a dozen exhaling voices at the same time, including the editors of the "Elemental" journals, including the high-level Arcanist. They all gave Lucian a grateful look, only Ignatius Khan was down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being rejected by the Alchemy journal, the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" also wants to be published in the next issue, but I still have not agreed." Lucien simply skipped The "Alchemy" journal allowed the invited auditors to wipe out the cold sweat and almost scared him to death. At the same time, they regretted it and missed such a significant paper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, my good friend K introduced me to Mr. Igna." Lucien smiled and looked at Ignatius, other arcans Also looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignaghic pale, I feel that Lucien’s smile is not good, the heart is pounding, and there is already an illusion in my mind: Lord Lavendi is standing In front of himself, roaring wildly, the saliva with a strong corrosion surname and poison surname fell on his face, making himself afraid and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Ignacy is really a good person, and told me to increase the length of the matter, and also approved the paper."<br /><br />&nbsp ;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah?" Ignatius did not expect Lucien to say so, violently vomited and quickly relaxed. But this sudden relaxation is in stark contrast to his previous extreme fears, which has produced a tremendous impact, and suddenly made him black and half dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Igna, Mr. Igna... What happened to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
