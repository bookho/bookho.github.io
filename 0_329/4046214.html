			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods looked up and looked at the coat rack in the corner of the office, fell into a recollection, and then jumped up: "It’s the guy from Odongko in the south. The discovered 'Amethyst' mine has very similar characteristics. Is it really new?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed his hand, black top hat and double-breasted dress Just flying over and wearing it, seems to be anxious than the last time I went to find Lucien, then took the lift to the bottom of the magic tower and took a carriage to the edge of Aringe, a strange magic tower like the devil's double horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odenko is a friend of Woods, a four-ring magician of the change department and the summoning department. Grandpa is a change master who almost entered the highest evaluation group. He is very rich, likes to travel and collect all kinds of unique things, but rarely does research on elements and alchemy. The new ore he finds is often placed at home for a long time before he thinks about asking people to identify which magic substances and what they do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage was running fast under the urging, and could not keep it steady. Woods, the magician of the force field and the star system, seemed to stay on the ground, did not feel Any discomfort, the star of his destiny in the soul became very active, but did not indicate to him a little problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhi, sharp wheels and ground friction sound, Woods jumped off the carriage, straight into the door of the magic tower of Odongko. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Woods, is your house on fire?" Odenko laid out the Woods in advance of the magical array of magic around the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks like a black bear as a whole, because the changes in their family are basically from the beginning of learning from ordinary bears, so a generation of generations slowly become either Like a brown bear, it is like a black bear, or like a snow bear in the North... Woods has been strengthened by magical agents. After running so far, there is no backache and leg cramps, just a little gasping: "Black bear, no, Odongko, sell Give me a few amphibole mines, the new magic ore that you just discovered in the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anxious, inattentively, Woods shouted out The name for Odongko. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Swan Lake, in the Rose Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gaston’s member of the Arcane Review Board, the arrival of the Elemental Will, the high-level magicians arrived, including the members of the Arcane Review Committee, elements The vice president of the will, the nine-ring magician Lavendi, the member of the Arcane Review Committee, and the elemental willer Avery, and other five elements of the magical authority in all directions of the magic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Arcane Review Committee is not only the five people who can review the elements of the paper, most of the high-level Arcans are two to four The faction's magic, but in general, as long as they have not left Alinge and its vicinity, the arcane papers in the elemental field are given to them first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the six authoritative high-level Arcans, there are also other high-level elements of the will of the element, a total of thirty-two high-level magicians, but only among them There are twenty levels of arcane level up to level six or above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the elements of the Master of the Master and the legendary magician level, only Laven is coming, after all, this is a discussion of the middle-level magician papers The annual meeting, but even so, the high-end power of the scene is enough to destroy the country - elemental magic has developed to the present, has been called destructive mad by other faction magicians, all kinds of violent explosion magic, all kinds of horror Corrosion, poisonous magic, all kinds of magic for body elements, is their logo. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an ordinary gray-haired old man looks like Lavindi, wearing a black robe with the current 65-element symbol, he gave a short speech. The "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference" officially began. The first paper presentation was Lucifer's long-known element of the Arcane Arcane genius Timothy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brunette with blue eyes, tall, wearing gold-rimmed magic glasses, a gentle and handsome appearance, but the content of the paper is four-ring magic The extremely violent type of "chain explosion", he improved the basic alchemy formula of this magic through arcane theory research and magic experiments, and then mapped to the construction process, which can increase the explosive power and penetration of 50%. range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Awesome ideas, right?" Lazar stood straight in the corner of the hall, listening carefully while facing him. Lucien is emotional. The optimistic day of the day has slowed down from the kind of shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the transformation of Mr. Timothy, if the enemy continues to defend and evade based on past experience, this will be the source of their nightmare." Lucien listened carefully to Timothy's speech, especially the mapping of alchemy recipes to construction. Part of the process, this is your own weakness. If you make up for it, you can try to construct the corresponding magic by nitration of glycerin and the black gold that may be made after the sputum. Then, depending on the situation, whether it is using magical fluctuations or not Magic fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After getting the "Amethyst Mine", Woods simply borrowed Odongko's Deluxe Magic Lab for experimentation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the magical array and the alchemy array arranged by the Archmage, Woods quickly separated the subsidiary material from the "Amethyst Mine" and placed it Inside the "Split Mirror Magic Array". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Array With the slow start of the escapement, Woods stared intently at the opposite spectrum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing the spectral line that he had never seen before, Woods breathed immediately and his face rose red, as if he was caught in an unseen dream The spectral line is so beautiful and beautiful, it is such a shocking heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really new! This mixed substance contains new elements! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding column of the Lucian paper in the safe position of the alchemy platform next to him reads: "This kind of aluminum element will be discovered by spectroscopic analysis." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods turned to look at the spread of the paper, and turned back and stared at the spectrum, this is not speculation, but almost predicted! Moreover, the contents of Lucien's "prophecy" are all derived from the previous elemental cycle name! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? Woods’s mind is messy and squeaky, hard to think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took a deep breath and ruled out all the ideas, opened the magic array and the alchemy array, and tried to purify the new elements with different methods such as high temperature burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab set up by the Archmage is exceptionally good. When lunch time comes, the magical array in front of Woods has a group of silver-white metal crystals, which are beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods can’t take lunch and start measuring the data and surnames of this new element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."Atomic volume 69.8." After several consecutive measurements of the atomic weight of the new element, Woods looked at the paper next to him with some fear, though in his mind. I remember very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding column of the thesis reads: "The atomic weight of this type of aluminum is between 68 and 70."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hey, hey, Woods’s heart beats and his ears roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he bit his teeth and began measuring other data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Metal specific gravity 5.94."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corresponding column of the paper: "Metal body weight 5.9~6.0 "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Volatile, can gradually dissolve in acid and lye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The paper corresponds to a column: “Not volatile at room temperature, will gradually dissolve in acid and lye.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......one data, one species The quality of the surname is consistent with that of Lucien according to the law of the elemental cycle. Woods keeps shaking his hands and feels a bloody color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are already red, heartbeat and tinnitus are like thunder, and I really feel what is called thrilling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods has no doubts, this will be the field of elemental magic, no, this will be a milestone discovery that the entire magical world can be published in history! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to keep calm, Woods completely records the experimental process and experimental data with the still shaking hands, saves the new element samples with magic vessels, and then holds They, subconsciously put on a black top hat and rushed out of the magic tower of Odongko. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
