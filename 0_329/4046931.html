			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The study of genetic factors has penetrated the cell level, and traditional spells can no longer be observed. Only observation methods based on micro-domain knowledge can be further studied, such as The combination of X-ray and Magic Crystallography is one of the major directions, so we need to master the relevant non-death spells. Of course, this research has only begun in recent years, and there are no outstanding results. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange and familiar male surname sounded in the Downey, scared him to hurry and saw a bloated black-haired boy Also positive is "artificial intelligence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joan, Jones?" Downey is not sure, "Do you know what I think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Jones did not turn his head, hehe smiled: "I see you staring at the course, guessing that you must not understand why this is arranged, so explain a few words to you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the observation method, our body is also composed of atoms and molecules. Therefore, knowledge in the microscopic field is essential, otherwise how do you study various types of living matter?" Carl playing the game is not silent. And continue to interject, "and on this part of the course, there is more basic knowledge, that is, the relevant theory in the field of mathematics, do not master them, you will not be able to move forward in the field of arcane."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already seen it? Our mathematics course is called "Dead High Mathematics". Don't look at this one. It seems to be a general story. In fact, it is self-contained. System, including other college 'calculus', 'matrix', 'analytic geometry', Courses such as complex variable function, 'real variable function', and 'mathematical analysis', in accordance with complementary and progressive relationships, throughout the five years of study, the number of classes per week can be compared with our body structure and genetic factors courses. It’s beautiful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl just stops talking, rarely stops with a few simple sentences, often with detailed, accurate, and wide-ranging descriptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculus...matrix...complex function... Downey heard the forehead swell, the blood vessels bulging, I want to give the "artificial intelligence" in front of me Beaten, although he admire the masters in the field of mathematics, and its mathematical level is not bad, but as long as it is not a mathematical genius, learning in this area is always full of pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click to the next page, Downey really saw the course "Death of the High Mathematics", he closed his eyes, bite his teeth, listen to his ears Carl kept on telling and chose a good mentor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he will be based on the different schedules of different tutors, the number of electives, and the specific circumstances of the tutor, the theoretical course and magic analysis, potion configuration The application courses such as the Alchemy Advanced are selected one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the early arrival, and Carl’s introduction to the mentor, you don’t have to spend the same time as other freshmen to ask senior students, or randomly choose Every course of Downey and Sami has chosen the tutor he wants, such as Robert who teaches "Human Body Composition", and if you choose this course, you don't modify it yourself, and wait until "Human Body Composition" After the completion of the study, it will automatically advance to Robert's "Body Reform" class, and truly enter the deep field of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the course is selected, Downey’s class schedule is automatically formed, and it is densely packed. Except for the evening and the week, there are arrangements. Normally, the Necromancer Many courses should be arranged in the middle of the night, but here is the "dead world", there is no difference between day and night, so Downey can vacate the evening time, digest the knowledge gained during the day and learn the spells, he understands that with his own Talent, it is impossible to understand after listening, there must be some private time to consolidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new students who came to pick up the class gradually got a long queue. Carl reluctantly left the "artificial intelligence" and looked at the class schedule in Donnie. Very male surnamed and laughed: "Most of our courses are the same mentor. When we go to class together, there are the same magic towers everywhere, as well as illusion maze and other defense surnames. There is no familiarity. With people, it is easy to get lost. I have encountered several girls who have been spinning around a magic tower before, and they are so anxious to cry out. It is really distressing..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to a girl who is pure and beautiful, and who is more beautiful than most of the female surnames, Downey is full of sense of violation, and quickly interrupted Carl’s words: “You are familiar with the terrain here. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen the map, but I am a genius in this respect!" Carl raised his hand. If you don't believe me, I will say what you believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey hurriedly nodded: "Then we will be in trouble with Electromagnetics next Monday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Carl tried to make a bold look, but under his gentle and "beautiful", he could only look very cute. "I really like this kind of course because there will be magic experiments." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiment? Carl? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at Carl’s face and clearly said the word “pleasure”. Suddenly, he was shocked and scared. Can he change his tutor? Can I take a leave for the lab? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the leadership of Carl, who would never be dry-mouthed, Downey and Sami remembered the Arcane Library, the Magic Exchange Room, and the Academic Tower. The paper submission office, the Necroft Seal Tower, the burial place, and various restaurants, canteens, etc., are the same as the story of the "Sound of Mystery" and the introduction of the corresponding programs on the TV station. The School of Magic has different cuisines from different countries, so that Downey and Sami had a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler School of Magic is so large that after visiting a circle, Downey and others returned to the bedroom when they were close to the early morning, and Sami had already relied on Downey. It seems that I will fall asleep at any time. Downey also feels physically and mentally exhausted. He just wants to rest well, but Karl is still mentally awkward. It seems that there is endless energy under the appearance of a delicate appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is really tired, ready to rest." Carl entered the bedroom, quite elegantly stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at Sami, who had fallen asleep and slept, and smiled in his heart: "We are tired."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his gaze suddenly solidified, because the back of his back to Karl slowed down the black robes, his neck **, as beautiful as a swan, waist Slim, curved and moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl!" Downey hurriedly looked up at the ceiling and stopped, only to feel his nose hot, and his heartbeat unconsciously speeded up. "Can go Is the bathroom changing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter? I am also a boy!" Carl's voice was lower than normal, half of the doubt was half annoyed, then he I suddenly laughed and said: "You really pay attention to **, and you value this aspect more than some nobles who think they have no rich connotations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not insist, went into the bathroom Changed clothes, wore a loose white shirt and pajama pants, and let Downey turn to look at the wall again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wash is finished, lie down to the **, Downey is tossing and turning, it is difficult to sleep, the course of the Necromancer is more difficult than I imagined, and it is still Hate and escape knowledge, there is a "special" big man in the bedroom, and his "magic school life" will be colorful, still terrible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that Carl will soon learn how to change the genetic knowledge of the body, then everything is normal...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hey, when we came back, it seemed that we had missed a person. What did he seem to be? Hey, what does it have to do with me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Karl, is there a missing one in our bedroom?" Downey finally thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern, I have been with you all the time." Carl has not answered, the unique familiar and unfamiliar voice is ringing in the dark," Yes, my name is Jones, I think you should have forgotten it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s heart lamented and buried his head in the pillow, what are these? People! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black night sky is deep and quiet, but its edge is infinitely gray It’s bleak, and the “dead world” seems to be like this forever, and it will not change at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the monotonous black-and-white gray envelope, the tombs surround the Heidler School of Magic, seemingly messy, overlooking from a high altitude, but with a strange sense of coordination, It has a strange and mysterious taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
