			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vaurit Principality, the holy city of Aalto, the Golden Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the evening, Cardinal Catherine and others, under the leadership of Cardinal Philippe Bell, prayed on Sunday, then watched him silently Leave and return to the living room, no longer preaching or guiding other clergy as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Lord Philippe?" another cardinal asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cossack shook his head: "I don't know, it should have been more than a month ago, and Lord Philippe is more unusual."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After more than a month ago, was it that the Voice of Mystery began to smear the pope's majesty, the disaster magician Viken?" The cardinal questioning seemed a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics of the middle and lower levels have long felt numb to this repeated rumor, and they have not paid too much attention because it is nothing compared to the previous content. There are no real evidences in the prominent places, and there is no even more exaggeration. However, for the high-ranking clerics who are familiar with the history of the church and familiar with various details, they are shocked and heard. Many places can confirm the historical details. It seems to contain a lot of real information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, because of the many possibilities of history, there are many stories that can be compiled, and the high-level clerics are only slightly suspicious, and soon Diluted the mind in this regard, but when I mentioned it again, I couldn’t help myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cossie raised his head violently, his expression was quite dignified: "I remembered, Lord Feilibel was abnormally attending the Cardinal Mission held by His Majesty the Pope. The emergency meeting started..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should have nothing to do with..." The cardinal who spoke was very gloomy, as if he had thought of a lot of bad things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosie smiled very reluctantly: "I think so too, any devout believer will not feel good when he hears the deliberate filth of the Magic Council." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow makes" Feili Bell sat dumbly behind the desk, watching the beating candlelight fascinating, gradually dim against the sky, his beard It’s like a glimmer of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼啪, the candlelight made a loud noise, slammed high, and Philippe Bell’s face was white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Felix Bell, do you think about it? This will help you to restore the heart of faith, closer to the God of truth, we don't need What do you do, as long as you give us critical information when you are critical." "The candlelight" keeps leaping, sending out a husky sound that is mixed with noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fili Bell is gloomy and looks at the "candle fire" in front of him: "You simply can't enter the mountain of heaven, relying on the magic of the sun king Tanos." When you take notes, you dare to assert that he is the supreme Lord? I can't believe that I will not learn the power of faith in the Northern heresy, and turn away from the Lord's grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Candlelight" sends out a series of laughter: "You have subconsciously called Lord Tanos the Sun King, not your name. What do you think in your heart, but I am, but Lord Tanos What is his identity? After His integration with the Mountain of Heaven, He is the true god, transcending the existence of the god, the supreme Lord in your mouth. He is only a short sleep, and the more believers grow up, the easier it is for He to recover. Philip Bell, are you going to renounce the god of truth with the fallen man Benedict III?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Atlante, no matter how you can grasp the heart I won't be confused by you, you leave, or else I Turn golden cathedral divine the array. "Phillip Bell silent for a minute, firmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" jumped and said: "Filibel, I feel your shake, as long as you are willing, we are ready to accept your investment, you look at it The priests of Richard and other Holm State religions will grow rapidly in a short period of time, because the gains we get from the 'world of the door' exceed your imagination, and go further than the saints of the northern church. Heaven Mountain is not close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the "flame" shrinks and everything returns to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the church flourishes, we can benefit from it. Since His Majesty the Pope has given sincerity, we naturally will not be stupid to the foundation of our own, Atlante, you are too young to marry the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A manor outside the city of Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of the Curse closed his eyes and no longer looked at the silver candlestick in front of him. At this time, the "candle fire" suddenly jumped and stretched. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" Atlante opened his eyes and watched the "candle fire" on alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candlelight" is constantly changing, like a distorted villain, it makes an old voice: "My projection is not important, what is important is The information I brought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What intelligence?" "The Eye of the Curse" Atlante speculates on the identity and purpose of this mysterious projector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame" jumped and said: "How to become a kind of God-like intelligence, including complete legendary ascension steps, complete emotional power cohesion, complete body* * Method, complete magic array arrangement, complete special magical items refining..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Benedict III, no, Viken..." Atlante's voice is full of alert, fortunately he is just a magical ** here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candlelight" laughed and said: "I said, it doesn't matter who I am. The important thing is that you want to improve your strength and want to be the legendary peak. I want to promote the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I will be so stupid? Believe in the way the enemy gives?" Atlante sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candlelight" shrinks and expands: "You don't believe it doesn't matter, but you shouldn't mind reading the complete information in this regard. As for whether it is true, you can Self-verification, and I don't need you to help me with what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do I need to do to help you? Don't you pay any price?" Rand asked with some surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The candlelight" snorted: "What help can you give me? I just pity you, Douglas, Fernando, Lucien Evans actually I got a more complete method of the god-like, but they concealed it and studied it alone. Well, you don't have to doubt anything. I will tell you all the knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You want to provoke the inside of the parliament..." Atlante saw the purpose of "Vicken", but did not have any resistance, letting the "candle light" separate a line of fire to connect to his head, anyway It’s a magical lover. It’s okay for him to play a plot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the expression on Atlante’s face became cloudy and the fire line disappeared quietly. The “candle light” smiled twice. After that, I blew myself down, but I really didn’t let Atlante promise anything, and signed a magic contract! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The catastrophe king is really a big deal..." After a long time, Atlante sighed for a long time, who can think that Pope Benedict III will directly become a god Share the secret to yourself? Just like this is not the precious knowledge that can cause legendary wars, but the roadside potatoes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are methods, there is only a small hope to become a god, there are many difficulties and obstacles on the road, but at least for the time being, this is It has been proven to be the only way to go straight to the level of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly guessed that Atlante of Benedict III recalled the contents of his mind, closed his eyes and knew that this kind of God’s road would take Whatever comes, but still can not help but see it, as if it exudes irresistible charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like the words that Evans likes to say, this is a righteous conspiracy, so I don't need to promise things, sign contracts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Winter of the Winter, the "New Alchemy Foundation" class, Heidi no longer The willingness also adds to the dynamics of the wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "Department of Academic Affairs" teacher Ernesto walked in and announced two things. One is the middle of the cold moon, the Magic Academy will organize all Students go to the depths of the North to conduct field practice teaching, mainly to examine students' ability to use magic comprehensively, to identify the ability of various creatures, to apply the knowledge of adventure common sense, and to distribute the journals such as "Arcane". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
