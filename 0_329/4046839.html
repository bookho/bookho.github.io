			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Doris’s exit, I knew that I had made a big mistake, and the golden fishtail slammed into the sea, causing the spray to splash, the water The sound is soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spray between the waves, her figure suddenly blurred, even if Lucien’s spiritual field and Natasha’s will always lock her. At this time, there was also a sudden feeling of emptyness, watching her transparent without any warning, melting without warning, just like the thin snow met the yang of July! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, Doris melted completely, meeting the sea, and a white foam on the surface of the sea, reflecting the pale and bleak sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s spiritual field can no longer sense the breath of Doris, it seems that she really blends with this sea, or each The tiny bubbles are her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubbles are broken one by one, and the white eyes on the deep blue sea will disappear completely. At this time, Lucien’s mouth is as ethereal as it seems to come from another world: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding environment is inexplicable, and Lucien’s hands condense one The scepter, but not dazzling, the light scepter, as it gently touches, the whole sea is rippled like a freshwater lake at night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road is like a time and space, like layers, stacked in layers, separating the wide tens of kilometers of the nearby sea from the surroundings. It will be difficult to detect the oceans under a few hundred meters because they are in other time and space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time and space cage, the ocean is quiet and swaying, and the deep blue is faintly melancholy. Suddenly, the water in a certain area rises and solidifies into sapphire. The translucent "statue", then the face of the statue became clear, it was the appearance of Doris, and her golden fishtail jumped out of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris looked at Lucien and Natasha with a pair of blue eyes, biting her lips and not talking, as if weighing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a good person with good character. I generally don't like to fight people and carry out unnecessary killings. I hope you don't let me do things that I don't like." Lucien smiled mildly but could not look soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris is not a magician, there are no more strange ways to escape, and he is not willing to fight with Lucien, whose strength is obviously crushing himself. In that case, only Ten percent of the possible escapes are her unacceptable adventures of singing and free-spirited mermaid, so she nodded lightly: "If you want to know the 'blue door,' I can tell you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blamed herself in her heart. She just sang too much. If she discovered earlier, these two humans have enough time to escape, not fall. To the present situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To ensure the truth, please ask Ms. Doris to sign a magic contract with me." Lucien still carries the standard courtesy smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contract? Devil · I would rather die than accept the contract of sale!" There was an angry storm in Doris's blue eyes, and the surrounding environment was It has become a lot bleak, the sky is faint and somewhat gloomy, and there is no ups and downs in the sea. It seems that there is a horrific explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has heard that some people with special hobbies have extraordinary preferences for mermaid, even though most mermaid can’t turn into humans and fade the fishtail, so She really would rather succumb to her death than to get rid of it - if her own desperately can ruin the evil magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien chuckled: "This contract has no selling content. Just a guarantee. If you lie, I can immediately sense it and if You can reveal my whereabouts and destination afterwards, and I can also sense it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, this obviously unfair contract will not be signed And the devils, false gods, etc. who are "notary" may also refuse to provide better protection for this, but now the situation is not much more than Lisi has extra choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with difficulty: "I will look at the contract first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his right hand left, there were dozens of articles on the contract that made it difficult to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris catches the contract that Lucien flies over and read it over and finds that if they don’t lie, they are going to the “Blue Gate”. The contract will not be binding on itself. Of course, if you violate this, you will be punished by the "atomic universe" and die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic universe······" Doris looked at Lucien, how is the contract notary public himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the seven sea generals under the stalwart of "The Endless Sea of ​​the Lord", the mermaid princess who is often active in the sea of ​​the sea elves, she also has a certain magical parliament Understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "The object you signed the magic contract is my wife, and I am a legendary magician with my own half-face, obviously Qualified as a contract notary, even more professional than most devils, there will be no delay in the punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why legends are used to describe this level The reason for the strong, can not be human! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at Dolce’s slightly frowning grievances, and sighed in the soul line: “I’m a little bit sad, you really have no gentlemen. Demeanor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Gentleman, if you are graceful, the consequences will be a lot serious...····" Lu Xien joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris reluctantly signed the signing, and when Natasha also signed the contract, it suddenly burst into flames and burned, seemingly even the surrounding waters. It will burn with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale flame suddenly turns dark, deep and dark, and there seems to be a little bit of different colors of stars shining, and changing the environment around Lucien." The projection of the atomic universe is similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star of the flame condenses a handsome face, solemnly said: "I declare the contract in the name of the 'atomic master.'" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris looked at the two identical faces in the flame and in the sky, hating the teeth and whispering: "I have signed the contract, what do you want to ask? Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act of being a party and being a magistrate is too shameless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you be surprised to hear 'The Blue Gate?'" Natasha asked her doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris sighed softly: "Because I am here, it is for the 'Blue Gate,'"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw Lucien and Natasha without asking questions, and said: "I was ordered by Hells, and came to the lost place, this dark stream must pass through the area, and then guide The sea people went to the 'blue door, where there are many places in this must-have area, so I just sang and recruited the people, let them go to other places to guide them, to prevent the sea people from coming here to lose their direction<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lost Land is the name of the seas for the depths of the endless oceans. It is the name for the ocean currents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Underflow...” Lucien repeated it in a low voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s undeniable that the Magic’s natural study of the ocean is still at a shallower level. After all, there are sea occupations in areas such as Wuyang and Yangyang. The farthest distance of human fleet activities is just the islands occupied by the Magic Council. It is enough to explore deep water and not afraid that most of the sea magicians are at least six rings. They value the minerals, treasures, special plants, creatures and other things on the seabed, but they lack research on the ocean itself. Therefore, Lucien is on the road. More is flying in the air, recording environmental data and forgetting the situation at the bottom of the sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha sees Lun’s thinking, and has not continued to ask questions. Instead, I waited for two minutes and waited for Sean to open his own mouth: "'The Blue Gate, does it exist? Why should Helks let other sea people go there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I followed Helks and went down to the bottom of the lost land. There is indeed a 'blue door,' but Herkes will not let me down. Close, I just looked at it from a distance, feeling that it was both real and illusory, although it was there, but it was as far away as the moonlight sea, very magical. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
