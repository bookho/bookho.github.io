			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the voice of the high priest was heard, the Sphinx’s expression changed, and he leaned over his body and looked at Aska, both in silent testimony. It is him who teaches the low-level "grave guards", and he is also quietly pulling away from him, lest he be punished by the high priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Askar" is already Lucien. I just chose this corridor to collide with the "gatekeeper", just to let They take care of the surveillance magic array, so they drag themselves to the corner of the remote point to "learn", giving them plenty of time and good environmental distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the corridor, a high priest wrapped up in a black corpse with all four fluffy legs, all over the corridor, is next to the "Saint Gate" The guardian, who followed Ink’s gaze, rotted and gloomy eyes, looked coldly at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy has just had a terrible car accident, and Lucien’s belly, while bowing his head, pretending to be afraid of awe: “The high priest, just now The tomb guards ran freely in the mausoleum, violating the law of the priests and priests. After I got caught, I also hit me, so I couldn’t help but teach him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest looked as if he was looking up and down the road, and it was cold and cold, and he was lifeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien controls the muscles, let them make the illusion of slight tremors, and then the heart beats slightly accelerated, oh, oh, full of "uneasy" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the talent magic, carefully examined the Sphinx in front of the "Askar", determined that he had no problem, the high priest only slowly opened: "You just Use magic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound tablet does not fluctuate, as if the vocal cord has broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, he... turned out to resist, me, me, I am not, yes, intentional..." Lucian "feared" and stuttered, slightly in his heart Relieved, just to make you notice the magic fluctuations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you let Aska stun here, or more than ten minutes, Helges will definitely look for "Fair", when things are easy Being exposed, and you need to wait for the opportunity, not so quickly into the "Sacred Door", so you must send "Fair" back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has to use "mutilation" to turn Aska into "Fair" and not allow high-order casters to notice him - already High-level Lucien, the great knight and the mid-range caster, have little chance of seeing through the deformations he has shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "sports" of Aska’s lesson, Lucien used the talents of two kinds of Sphinx to cover up the malicious deformation and tried to suppress The fluctuations of these two talented magics made it impossible for the Sphinx, who was not far away, to sense it, thus disguising himself as a normal Sphinx who could not control the use of magic and fear of being discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this kind of magical fluctuations cannot completely avoid the induction of the ruins in the mausoleum, and was discovered by the high priest who took turns tonight by monitoring the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this is part of Lucine’s plan, because you must make an excuse to personally send “Fair” back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest seems to be able to see through the body and soul of Lucien staring at his eyes, from which he "reads" fears, uneasiness, panic and so on. "Normal" emotions, as well as pleasures and refreshments that have not yet disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aska, this time, you handled it very badly, unless the enemy invaded, otherwise you should not use magic in the mausoleum anyway, etc. When the task of guarding the Gate of the Holy One is over, he will accept the whipping punishment.” The voice of the high priest is flat and flat, without any emotions and ups and downs, and it is very uncomfortable to hear people, like in the face of a long time damn for many years but still drifting The decaying ghost in the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the high priest." Lucien answered with "frustration and pain". It seems that the high priest is worried that there are two consecutive violations when he guards. The law of the law will make him scolded in front of the god priest, so he chose to punish privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest continues to speak rigidly and rigidly: "You bring the grave guard who violates the law to his squad, let his captain punish him, and tell him The captain asked me after the guards ended."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will." Lucien suppressed the inner joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the high priest returned to the "Sacred Gate", Lucien looked at Ink with a scornful look: "You are a timid person, Don't talk to me in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ink was a bit guilty and confused, and wanted to explain it, but Lucien’s attitude suddenly made him angry. He snorted heavily: "Wait for being whipped!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successfully destroy the relationship between the two, no longer worry about Lucy’s identity because of the conversation Start a small song, turn around the corner, drag "Fair" and return to the original road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Outside the weird hall filled with black coffins, Herguz was annoyed with anger: "Aska, what did you do to my subordinates? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, throwing "Fair" into the hall, Lucien said: "Herggs, you damn subordinates dare to rush to me So I taught him a good meal and let him wake up for a few days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dirty man, my subordinates only I can teach!" Helges angered the sky, stepped forward, eyes "Aska", only one fist in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herggs, what happened? Do you dare to do it? Haha, I tell you, the high priest will let you finish looking after the guard, you actually Indulge in the mausoleum in the chaos!" Lu Xien proudly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herges's anger immediately disappeared, slightly trembling: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha Waiting to be whipped!" Borrowing Ink's words, Lucien turned his arrogant turn and left, very embarrassing and Aska's surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herggs whispered again and again, and did not dare to really do it. He could only watch Askar leave with anger, then move around with four hooves. Steps, to relieve the depression in your heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Hercules, do we ask the priests to treat Fair, let him wake up early." A "grave caretaker" came forward to please Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take your X, squat, and give me a meal!" Helges flew his forefoot and kicked his foot To please the subordinates, to hate this culprits, so the four hoofs danced, "Fair" trampled full of scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No grave guards are not afraid of angering the high priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Lucien and Ink walked silently before the door of the Holy One, took over the trenches, and stood upright to guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Priest also returned to his stone cottage and continued to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, the more chilly in the mausoleum, the death of a strand of death roaring, as if there were countless undead creatures waving the arms like a forest Shock the door, and change to a timid Sphinx. At this point, the legs may fall down softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the high priest praying in the low ground, Ink looked at the front, without the meaning of a low-pitched conversation, Lucien began to ponder how to sneak into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the important information about the layout of the saints’ gates and the simulation of the mantra, Rhein has taught Lucien – even if he is a legendary vampire, sneaking into this When the gate is gated, it cannot pass directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneak out of the spirit and check the "Sacred Door" to confirm that the knowledge is correct, Lucien has a preliminary draft, which is dark night and daytime The boundaries of "handover" cover up the magical fluctuations of the self with the short-moving chaos of the death force in the gates of the Holy One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was going very well, except for Herges, who took a tour of the grave guards squad several times and glared at Lucien, all night. No abnormalities have occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the morning, the darkest and coldest moments come, and the "Sacred Gate" becomes awkward, like a shadow gate leading to the dead and sleeping in hell. The richness of death and the chilly breath permeated from the inside, so that the body of the Lucien Knight could not help but tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
