			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard such an answer, Tom found that he had neglected the rebellious and reluctant psychology that was unique to their age, and that there were indeed many places that did not make it clear. So I hurriedly said: "There are some things I think you need to understand first, the current magic parliament is not the magic empire of the past, and now the magicians have no old ideas of the past magicians, as long as you have not really become an apprentice of Mr. Evans, Even if he followed him for a period of magic and arcane, it will not prevent you from becoming a disciple of a powerful gentleman with his talent and efforts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know that Mr. Astar must have warned you that there are countless ancient inheritance magicians who cannot accept the concept of arcane and cannot accept the results of exploring the world into the magic, until the death has failed to obtain the level of the Arcanist. And there is no major breakthrough in magical power. The proportion of such people who are promoted to middle-level magicians or high-level magicians is really not as good as that of you. Apprentices who accept arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you should see that Mr. Evans is a formal magician who is less than twenty years old. Talent is a good category even at the parliamentary headquarters. He is so young, so smart, has the golden conditions to accept a new concept, and is completely different from those old-fashioned old guys. And he has enough time to promote, Maybe you will honor him as an Evans instructor in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructor is used to call the high-level magician, and the rank of the strong is rare everywhere. For example, in the Principality of Aalto, even with the Cardinal and the members of the Knights of the Holy Sword, there are no more than twenty strong knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s words are exaggerated, but his emphasis on Lucien is very obvious. On the one hand, because he is young enough to become a formal magician, his mental strength The talent is definitely not low. On the other hand, he is deeply impressed by the assassination of Brown. The cleverness of the smart and critical moments is an essential element of most successful people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words dispelled the worries of the magic apprentices and showed the bright future of Lucien, making most teenagers eager to try, but they have This age of rebellion and (read-force) special, has the same unique shyness, not willing to be the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the atmosphere was brewing, Sprint, who used himself as the apprentice boss, stood up again and replied abruptly: "Mr. Evans, I still feel that I am better at learning arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, our studies have their own arrangements and cannot be disrupted because of you." Katrina Also a little reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s face is gloomy, and he completely underestimates the rebellious and arrogant talents of this age’s children who are not admitting their abilities, obviously for their good Let them make a young magician with great potential, and the result is instead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he wanted to persuade a few more words, Lucien said: "Everyone has their own choices, I understand you. Others, there are Have you studied arcane with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven and seven magic apprentices around Sprint and Katrina, looked at Lucien, again Looked at the two people, bowed their heads, and the toes rubbed away, no one would stand up first, fearing that they would be accused of disregarding friendship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their silence infects those who are eager to try, and they want to stand up and be embarrassed to take a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repressed silence, suddenly someone is full of respect and meaning: "Mr. Evans, I want to learn arcane with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annick? You?!" The apprentices were surprised to see Annick, whose hair was yellowish and fluffy, his blue eyes twitching with the brilliance of the red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Annick’s ordinary face and smiled: "Annick, are you sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Evans. I came from a magical family and grew up in the magical legends of various magicians. I was instilled with a strong and noble image of the official magician from a young age, but our family is already full. There is no official magician born in a hundred years. Now you can meet your young formal magician, who can follow you for a period of arcane and magic, is my dream opportunity." Annick replied sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien nodded lightly: "Welcome to you, Annick, before we go to Allinge, let us study together, every day, every day, and progress together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the strange and complicated eyes of other magic apprentices, there are two more sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans, I also want to follow you to learn arcane." The sound is crisp, and the appearance is as refined as the doll's lei yiya with two big eyes. Looking at Lucien, she was fourteen years old and she seems to be only eleven or two years old due to her stunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, can I ask you for an arcane question with Annick?" The tail is getting used to it, as if Heidi was at home with the spoiled Heidi. Come out, she is a little fat, the five senses are not beautiful, but more lovely. Even a little faint freckles on her face added a bit of playfulness to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two of them quietly pulled the clothes behind Laanick, as if to say, as a friend, we support you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien lamented the pure friendship of the children and said to them: "No problem, let's learn together. Ok, now it's over. I can't guide them for more than three of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Tom’s statement, it’s communication, but Lucien didn’t think that he had a bad luck in the Arcane base. The surname is said to be a guide, but with the identity of his official magician, everyone does not feel any strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lu Xi’an’s words, there were several apprentices who wanted to stand up and they all showed disappointing expressions, and they faintly complained about Annick’s three of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, congratulations to the lucky Annick, Reyia and Heidi, I believe that under the guidance of Mr. Evans, you will make gratifying progress." Tom applauded. "Other people don't want to be disappointed. Maybe there are other magicians coming before you leave. Even if you don't, you will be arranged to teach well in Aringe. Your own efforts are the most important." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tom, we understand." Sprint glanced at the three magic apprentices who stood up and then surrounded him with his youth. "We will Don't bother Annick, Reyia and Heidi to ask Evans about the Arcane and continue our discussion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices hesitated Or follow Sprint back to the blackboard hanging on the wall. Katrina didn't say anything, but she also took a few girls to the corner sofa to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom reluctantly spread his hand to Lucien: "The children of this age are the most troublesome, but fortunately Annick, Reyia and Heidi are Better, Ivans, I have to leave, there are still a lot of things to do. You can pick one in the empty room on the third floor. After seven days, we will set off. Try not to go out during this time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, bear children." Lucien tried the belly and then answered: "I am looking forward to the departure after seven days."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Tom, Lucien greets three magic apprentices sitting on a sofa that has just been semicircular: "I introduce myself, I am Evans, from the western part of the continent, good at elemental systems." The magic of the stars, but no specialization, the other arcane and magic will continue to learn. You have any questions you can ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, my name is Heidi, the king of Syria, because of his good spiritual talent, he was a magician. Born to Stourke, I was assessed. Oh, I only entered the meditation state and became a trainee magic apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lively Heidi pre-emptive introduction, but also left the child's surname, she couldn't help but show off her spiritual talent. "I am using four elements of meditation, and the magic of each department is learning."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya black ponytail little bit: "Hello, Mr. Evans. I am Lei Yiya, Gusta Imperial, civilian family. Because of the belt The magician I came over was the gentleman of the parliament, so I learned the latest 'magnetic resonance thoughts', but Mr. Astarte said that no matter which kind of magic is learned in the future, the basics of arcane are necessary, hope. You can guide me." She is very polite, even if she thinks that Lucien is just beginning to learn arcane, she still uses the word to guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick has just introduced the part, so it is simple and concise: "Mr. Evans, I am from a small town in the Principality of Vaoli, just like you, learning It is the astrology and elemental magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
