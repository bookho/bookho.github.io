Indeed, they believe that the truth of the world should not be a scorpion, but it does not mean that it is really not. It is only what one thinks and thinks from various natural phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Douglas sighed: "I will use experiments to prove that the truth of the world is not a blind man. In fact, do you think?" However, the so-called probability cloud does not exist at all. The wave function only represents the electron population that conforms to this probability. It is not a single electron. Their own trajectory is not ubiquitous, but has a fixed line, which is closely related to this probability. Related, but we are temporarily unable to observe and confirm, so they appear in a state of chaos after passing through a single crystal until the overall probability appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not willing to admit Lucy En probabilistic interpretation and uncertainty principle, he has reflected on himself, should not replace the true world essence with the reality he believes, and then stand in this angle to refute, but should be from the contradiction of Lucien theory itself. And rigorous experimental results to prove the error, this is a good arcane attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he put forward his own opinion according to the impression after reading the paper roughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "true mystery" disappeared, and other visions disappeared. Lucien’s atomic universe also converges, answering very seriously: "Lord the Speaker, don't talk about you." This conjecture contradicts many derivations. As long as we complete the electronic double-slit interference experiment, we can verify whether it is correct or wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the electron is in front of observation A true particle has its own trajectory, and it can only pass through a gap at a time, and it cannot be **, and whether the interference fringe can appear and the appearance of the final pattern are related to the distance between the two slits, so if the electronic double-slit interference The experiment can really be established. How does the electron know the distance between the gap it passes and the other gap, so it is strictly required to fall in a certain area instead of another area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is like a labyrinth. There are seven different colors of red orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple at the entrance. The exit is only the correct road of blue. For the "wave" that can extend in space, it is quite At the same time Opening the entrance and exit, naturally know that blue is the right road, and the particles with fixed trajectory, that is, a "person", he can not know the export status at the same time after opening the entrance, how can he strictly follow the correct way every time? The road, not the other channel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Douglas, Brooke and other legendary magicians, the double-slit interference experiment is the core of the previous wave war, completely familiar, to understand Lucien The discourse did not understand the difficulty, nodded in nod, as long as the completion of this electronic experiment, can fully explain whether the electrons are really ubiquitous before observation, just like the strange ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued: "In fact, there are many interesting verifications in this experiment. If there is a double-slit interference fringe, then we pass through the electrons. At the moment of a gap, another gap is closed. Do you say that it will still follow the path of interference to the sensor screen, or immediately 'know' the closure of another gap, so change its state and go to the diffracted path?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Douglas, Fernando’s Hathaway, which is more prone to particle theory, such thinking experiments have pushed the wonders of electronics to even more shocking places. If the electron changes state, it either indicates that it is a real wave, there is no particle surname, so at the same time it passes two gaps, or it can only believe Lu Xi'an's description, it is a probability wave, pervasive in space, no Being absent, or another incredible possibility, electronics is a smart life, with its own consciousness and ability, so it can "sense and know" the situation on the other side of the gap, thereby adjusting  already. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter may be in line with the state of the magical world, but it is in contradiction with the existence of human beings. The basis of the material composition has its own consciousness, then not everyone. There are countless consciousnesses in the body that are not their own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Speaker of the House, the teacher, they thought silently, Lucien said slightly: "I know that the gap between the electron double-slit interference is very small, is The current magical experimental conditions can not be reached, but I also know that many legendary magic is the application has come to the front, I believe that after a few years of improvement, you will complete a similar magic array, alchemy device or legendary magic, then, everything will be Very clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien smiled: "Oliver, your idea contradicts many of the current experimental results. The cluttered light spots are the best evidence, and your interpretation appears even in your papers dealing with atomic structural models. A certain problem, I believe that some people have pointed out that the electronic particle name is unquestionable, and the experimental results of quality, charge, momentum and so on are undoubtedly confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem that does not mean improvement, at least more reliable than your probabilistic interpretation. It is like a madman talking about a dream." Oliver expressed his deep hatred of probabilistic interpretation. "I will find a way to prove It's a fallacy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned and left. He needed a quiet environment to think about the loopholes in the three papers of Lucien. Vulnerabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Oliver leave, Douglas looks seriously at Lucien: "I will try the electronic double-slit interference experiment and design more thought experiments to demonstrate "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called thinking experiment is an experiment that exists in the imagination, excluding the influence of any environment and other factors, excluding the limitations of experimental conditions, purely theoretically Exploring whether this experiment can be done under perfect conditions to prove the error or the possibility is a common method used by the Arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook also nodded lightly: "Everything speaks with experimental results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe the current A lot of experimental results are in line with your probabilistic interpretation, but I also believe in your explanation. Your quantum mechanics is incomplete and ignores a lot of things." Douglas and Sui said firmly, then left with Brooke and Vicente. Only Fernando, Heather and Helen are in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s red eyes still stare at Lucien, and Lucien also looked at him without fear. After a long time, he waved. Waving: "I need to be quiet, I need to think about how to verify your probabilistic interpretation error."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a subversion of the entire arcane and magic system, even if enlightened Like him, caring for students like him, he has to stand on the side of the truth in the heart, this is the brilliant conviction that the magic empire to the magic parliament does not know how many years of inheritance have accumulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly, sighed, and left the study of Fernan with Hathaway and Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri probably recovered calmly and thought: "Probability cloud-like electrons are harder to accept than waves, but if all the results are strictly Pointing at it, it is hard to accept and has to accept, the world does not shift with our will, but at least so far, we can not forcefully convince us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also expressed opposition, but not as intense and determined as the Arcane system Douglas, the electromagnetic system Bruker, Oliver and other great arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that her arcane attitude is better, nor is she more open-minded, just that the area she is good at is the element, the atom, the micro, the particle Is a new alchemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen recovered from the daze and looked at Lucien: "In the report you submitted, about the status and probability cloud of the immortal martyrdom." The expression is very the same, you get the inspiration from here? How can the quantum state of microscopic particles appear in the macroscopic world? Is this the secret of immortality? The real secret is not in the immortal chamber, but in the immortal martyrdom?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is worthy of being a half student of Douglas, asking why she was from instinct, and she did not participate in the debate, she can reasonably think of the immortal martyrdom report submitted by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really giving me inspiration, but more is based on a lot of experimental results. As for why immortality will make microscopic wonders appear in the macro, That is a question that needs to be studied by us. It may contain the secret of immortality." When Lucien proposed a probabilistic interpretation, he guessed that others would associate this with it, so he generously "recognized" it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the endorsement of the "immortal martyrdom", Helen revealed his thoughts, and Hathaway also quietly picked up his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will design experiments to demonstrate the correctness of your probabilistic interpretation and uncertainty." Helen said truthfully, "Immortal martyrdom" is like this, it does not mean electronic Is this the case, maybe it is something else? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
