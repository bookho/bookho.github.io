			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Astrologer" Anonis took out a quirky bracelet with a pocket watch-like object, solemnly said: "Thanks to Lucien Mr. Evans proposed the mathematical model and proof method of Leh's geometry, let us get rid of arrogance, shallowness and prejudice, and see the charm of mathematics from another angle, showing us that the axiom hypothesis is correct, the logic is strict and self-consistent. Necessary and full surnames, and only the genius of the genius who dare to subvert common sense, subvert experience, and subvert the intuitive understanding can complete this contribution.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to him for constructing another new geometry system to make the geometry field more perfect, we would like to recognize his extraordinary contribution in the field of mathematics with the twenty-second arcane scepter 'Evans Geometry'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the sun's scepter, Lucien let the tower to make the arcane scepter into a bracelet-like ornament "watch".<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-gray watch with diamonds inlaid with diamonds and engraved with a star-like pattern, Lucien follows the instructions of Annonis, surrounded by the Zodiac Palace The core of the sun has left its own spiritual imprint.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arcane Scepter 'Evans Geometry', seven-level perfect order items, use requirements: six-ring spirit Force and the initial substantiveization of the cognitive world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This unique style of bracelet has two magic effects: improving the accuracy of astrology; sensing your own destiny without entering the meditation environment." The main star thus raises the dangerous foreboding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a product of the Tower Alchemist, it also has a strong power of stars and destiny: every day you can cast a five-ring magic 'Doom Curse' twice. Five-ring magic 'Blessing of the Stars' twice, seven-ring magic 'destiny interference' three times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In January 820, I would like to thank Lucien for this Arcane Scepter? Mr. Evans made great contributions and made far-sighted views in the field of mathematics. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flow of time is reading, absolute, mathematical, and the same is true of fate. We can observe it, refer to it, predict it, and make certain Interference within the degree! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" - Cassias? Annonis<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this "worth-worthy watch", Lucien turned to look at the arcane masters below, which means profoundly: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the ancient magical empire to the parliament, it has gone through hundreds of years. In this long process, there have been many initial results that were not taken seriously, but later When the arcane masters encounter problems, they will shine brightly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to having realistic arcane and magical meanings, our research should encourage some of the more capable arcane masters to study in the field of mathematics. Outstanding results, so that we can have the tools to help us in the future exploration to ensure our speed of development. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesica, Milina, Gaston, Rachel and others all brought a smile, Lucian was really stubborn, others said he The new geometric system of the study has no actual arcane meaning. He repeatedly wants to argue that this is ahead of time and can certainly be used later, but when does it know who knows? Can you see that day, who knows? Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not stop because of their kind smiles, continued: "The Lord’s artificial planet experiment proves that his celestial system is correct and proves The vastness of the universe's starry sky, the opening of the microscopic gates also shows us a smaller and more subtle world. They are a big beyond imagination, a small beyond imagination, and they have exceeded the range that our current magical means can observe. During this time, you must have experienced a sense of powerlessness with ideas and theory but no way to experiment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is currently the most popular area of ​​parliament except for the wave-particle debate. The present magician has tried more or less research and heard Lu Xien. After that, they all felt the same place nodded, and the magical means of observing the macro and micro worlds did have a bottleneck.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien has always had a gentle and relaxed smile "So we can only sum up and summarize the phenomena from the observable parts through mathematical means and verify that the role of mathematics will play an unprecedented brilliance in this macroscopic and microscopic field, illuminating the darkness in front of us! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien’s expression suddenly became serious: “We are at normal size, and the macro and micro worlds have an order of magnitude difference with us. Perhaps we will find that we are familiar with intuitive understanding, experience summaries, and theoretical foundations in these two worlds. Unable to be universal, there are phenomena and theories of myths and legends that cannot be imagined, described or described by imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, the only thing we can rely on It’s not the eyes, not the ears, not the soul, not the experience, theory and bold imagination of the past, but the mathematical tools!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanist smiled and applauded, Expressing their respect for the winners and their thoughtfulness in the macro and micro definitions, they are not too concerned about Lucien’s last unfounded prophecy. The mathematical field is a near-abstract world, unimaginable before it appeared. The new geometry system is easy to understand, but in the real world of arcane and magic, how can there be a mythical legend that cannot be imagined, described or described? Theory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although deformation, summoning, and partial illusion are not included in the current arcane system, they believe that with the deep understanding of the body, further exploration of absolute time and space For a higher level of research on electromagnetic wave applications, these magical systems that retain ancient colors are bound to be included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Brooke’s words: “They must be included in the Arcane system and will be included!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, they forgot the Lucian energy sub-theory that they deliberately forgotten and refrigerated, which seems to contain the assumption of destroying the power of the arcane world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the garden villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put on his improved monolithic eyes and started the electromagnetic communication. After a period of current clutter, he heard Natasha. A slightly surprised voice: "Lu Xien, are you near Alto?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the communication satellite forwarding, her voice is a bit distorted and has Larger noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the ultra-long-distance call through the artificial planet." Lucien smiled and said that the call quality is within the expected range, and then slowly adjust after experience. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satellite communication and positioning, detection is not that simple. With the use of the Magic Council, many practical applications will be discovered in the future, and even The cause of the problem, the time will inevitably make the big arcans have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for Lucien, there is a problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposing your own artificial planet plan, in addition to verifying the Douglas celestial system, confirming that it is on the planet, there are two hidden main purposes, one is Natasha The second is to expose the "problem" and lay the foundation for the special theory of relativity and general relativity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the main theories of these two aspects of the Lucien Soul Library have not been unsealed, they do not prevent Lucien from knowing two through the satellite literature. The influence of relativity on satellites, such as fast-moving satellites, will produce a clock slowing effect according to the special theory of relativity, while satellites farther away from the ground will accelerate as the gravitational field becomes smaller, and the superposition of these two effects causes various problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synchronous orbiting satellites are relatively static due to relative ground motion, and the clock slowing effect can be ignored. Lucien only needs to consider the gravitational field, and the current communication planetary system is still very Simple, few users, no delay in talking to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha briefly silenced for a moment, and then quite surprised: "The birth of the star was a man-made planet that day? No wonder the Pope's Majesty will use God's descending... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she thought of the red moon, the mood is a bit complicated: "Is it made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just had this idea, and then made a suggestion, specifically the completion of the theoretical and practical construction of Lord Douglas." Lucien did not conceal, with a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted: "Sure enough, the idea you came up with, I feel more and more unable to keep up with your head, you always have a strange Weird thoughts can also become reality. Although you are a friend of this kind of guy, you are full of surprises, but you can’t help but be fooled by you one day. However, this ultra-long-range communication feels wonderful, as if we are not separated. Far, well, it’s fun to play.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
