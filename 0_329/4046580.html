			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just over half of the month of the fire (July), the hot air waves swept through Lentart and Allinge, making many people tossing and turning to sleep, only You can get peace in the early morning with a little coolness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the breezy morning, but more than 30 people strangely gave up sleep, waiting early outside the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men and women, old and young, some wearing black double-breasted long dresses, some are the most common magic robes with hoods, some The tailored long skirts, some simply white shirts with a common vest, the only common point is the tension and expectation of the face overflowing with the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell has no apprentice robe that can cool down the heat in a certain range. It’s quite painful in these days, plus staying up late to study, his face is white, 憔悴Unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the "competitors" around him, and he was under pressure. The apprenticeship of nearly forty people is estimated to be only a dozen. Others are not formal magic. Teacher, the level of arcane has reached the level, and even the middle-level magician participates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to pass the previous written test and interview, indicating that I also have a flash, can not lose confidence." Lovi kept screaming at himself, then thought To relieve the tension and the magicians and magic apprentices alongside, "You said, Mr. Evans will have a topic interview, will it involve the content of the new alchemy?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man with a surging face who keeps chanting what the magic apprentice is deaf to the ear, continues his final preparations. The two magicians glance at Lovi and see his apprentice badge on his chest. Even if there is no one in the robe, I turned my head and talked to myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman whose face is round like an apple is stunned and smiles. "I don't know, there is no Evans in the written test and interview." Mr. Participation, the questions given are exactly within the scope of my research, so I am a bit nervous now, I am not sure, many things in the new alchemy, I still don't quite understand. What are the questions you asked during the interview? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not beautiful, but the smile is friendly and easy-going, so that people can see no strangeness at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loy thought for a moment, retelling the elements of Jerome and the topics in the electromagnetic field at the time, and finally said: "What about you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, forgot to introduce myself, I am Elika." Ms. Yuan face also told her interview questions and exchanged experiences. I guess what part of the knowledge that Mr. Evans might focus on today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mages and apprentices have also joined the ranks of this exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearby Black laughed at Ophelia with a typical Holm character: "Would you like to listen in the past? Know their experience, maybe wait a minute." Can come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia smiled: "Okay, but I wonder why the total interview time hosted by Mr. Evans is nine in the morning. Point, this time the Allinge Magic Tower has just been opened, and the interviewer must wait outside in advance to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe Use this strange requirement to test our punctuality and obey the surname. After all, we are an apprentice-level assistant, not an arcane master with a reading research project.” Blake thought about it and analyzed it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia looked up at the towering magic tower and nodded lightly: "I think so, Mr. Evans is definitely not that kind. For those who are tormenting the interviewer, his request must have a deeper meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, Lucien Stand with the Rock, Jerome, and your own students by the window and look at the interviewers below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the words and descriptions of Prosper’s retelling, Roker smiled and looked at Lucien: “How do I feel that you are trying to torture the interviewer? For fun?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he turned his attention to poor students like Annick, who were tortured by Lucien’s “Arcane Cram school”. Although the arcane and magic levels are leaps and bounds, there are often cheeky expressions on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien coughed: "This is to observe their true surnames and their usual communication skills. They are coming as apprentice assistants. Only these two sides are good, they can integrate into the institute more quickly, and share the chores for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense that those who are arrogant and unwilling to communicate with those below their own level are not suitable for entering the Institute." Jerome is quite in favor. Lucien’s thoughts, then curiously asked, “Can the enrolled assistants become your students in the future?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint et al The eyes were brushed and concentrated on Lucien, and I was equally curious about the teacher's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "There are a lot of six students. I have my own magical studies, arcane studies, and everyday life. It is difficult to teach more." Students, if you have the potential to see who you are, let them guide yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude is common among high-level orthopaedic artists, they prefer Concentrate on teaching a small number of students, unless there are students who fall, die, or encounter rare geniuses, and this level of arcane masters, their students enjoy the benefits of his halo, their actions It also represents the teacher. There are more people and more trivial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina and other students quietly sighed, even if their surnames are good, but when they think of more classmates, the teacher will guide their time. The corresponding reduction, it is not so expected new companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine points soon approached, Lowell and others uneasily entered the magic tower and took the lift to the Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go in together, there will be a magic contract signed before the final interview." Rock stood outside the Atomic Research Institute and waited for them. The smile was very sincere. Because after this time, this troublesome thing is finally over, and I will never take such a task again in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Magic Contract? What is that?" asked a middle-aged magician questioningly, and he had signs of blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell recognizes that this is Mr. Isaac who just exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock uses his own smile as a handsome smile: "Our Atomic Research Institute is exploring the forefront of the elemental field and has a lot of secrets, so you need to sign a secret. The agreement, and Evans is a quasi-big arcian, an object that the church and other forces are eager to remove, and other arcanes with the Atomic Research Institute have become targets, so in order to prevent assassinations, newcomers must have A relatively harsh magic contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Severe..." Ophelia and others are dignified, although they can understand the behavior of the Institute of Atomic Research, but Harshness always makes them worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaac frowned: "I hope the magic contract is not too harsh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Ke smiled: "Reassure, you will not be treated as slaves, but those who are not guilty will be uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell does not care about the contract, he Just want to enter the Atomic Research Institute and follow Mr. Evans. For him, as long as he does not sell the soul and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roche’s guidance, the interviewers entered the conference room of the Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell, Black, Ophelia and other apprentices or foreign magicians can't control the curiosity of the heart, respect and excitedly peek at the head end Two magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Mr. Jerome, who has seen this, this one should be Lucien? Mr. Evans, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Lovi, this is a young man with thick black hair, with a clear outline, a deep facial features, and a handsome show, but that pair seems to contain Numerous mysterious black eyes and calm, confident and gentle smile make people completely ignore his appearance, thinking that he is so closely related to the "halo" he covers, he has no doubt that he is a powerful The horrible magician is a profound and intelligent arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Evans." Under the leadership of several magicians who have seen Lucien, Lowell and others together with mystery salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
