			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s unhurried, unobtrusive attitude in Felipe’s expectation, he showed an elegant smile: “I am not a modest person. There are also articles with Necromancer magic published in various periods, but you can still be heard by Professor Mr. You still feel the heartfelt joy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the joy, his expression does not think so. As a genius who was able to publish an article in the journal of Magic at the age of 22, the "professor" had heard of himself for granted. If it is the opposite, it means that his knowledge and strength are not enough to enter the upper level of the Magic Council, then you are welcome! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felipe is indeed not a modest person, as he himself said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his words: "You can teach Mr. You are not polite and candid, we are all members of the Magic Council, why should we wear that ugly? Black hood? Such a stupid dress does not match your identity and status.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows that he now adds one more sentence The danger of exposure, but the silence is even more suspicion, so I have to take the two evils to take the light, deliberately replied in a dull tone: "I don't want to go back to Allinge and you are still Mr. Felipe. Entangled. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When initially using the "professor" identity to impersonate the will of the element, Lucien did not expect such a great danger, even if astrology did not prompt After all, everyone "all" is the inside of the magic parliament. As long as they find the opportunity to explore the identity of the Stewart liaison, their purpose is achieved. The risk surname and the income are directly proportional. The only problem is to use less music in the future. The identity of the family.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that Mr. Felipe is carrying such strong hostility and killing, so that Lucien instantly understands that there may not be inside the Magic Council. Harmony in imagination: "There is no matching strength and corresponding intelligence in the future, and you can no longer use the identity of a professor! Now it’s really the end of the mountain. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Lucien has been riding a tiger, it is impossible to admit that he is pretending to be the elemental will and the people of Holm Royal Devils Court just to get Stewar. The exact identity of the liaison of the Magic Council. It is true that it is frank and honest, and it is estimated that it will be killed by the fiercely charged Felipe. Therefore, you can only go to the black and rely on your own strain to find opportunities for risk-taking!< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really malicious. Felipe is not surprised, he pointed to the sofa next to him: “There are still ten minutes from the official start of the banquet. I really want to talk to Mr. Professor, you like this character, huh, huh, the nickname of Karendia, borrowing from your study, don't you mind? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I don't mind, I like the spark of wisdom that stirs up." "The Viscount Karendia lazily leaned against the window sill and gracefully raised the red wine glass.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien actually wanted to answer, sorry, I don't want to Seeing your face, you don't want to talk to you, you can be a powerful magician who comes from the "representative" element. Now there is no excuse and reason to retreat, so you can sit down very calmly and leisurely on the back of the sofa: "I don't know what Mr. Felipe wants to talk about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be a character of the Magic Council, the Kingdom of Holm, things, customs and the environment! I don't know at all! There is no way to fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not! Don't! Never!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have heard Lucy Under the calm cry, the pale flame of Felipe's eyes disappeared, revealing a deep black pupil, like a sick face with a gloomy smile: "He is the second ring magician Cleveland who followed me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to introduce the middle-aged, bold and strong man next to him, and then continued: "Cleveland is not only learning the necromantic magic from me, but about the elements." There is also a lot of hobbies in magic, especially after Lord Donald’s recent discovery of the 25th 'Hol Crown' ring by discovering the new elements of spectral analysis. He is also planning to write a piece about spectral analysis. Arcane thesis. However, he still has a lot of theoretical knowledge in this area. He has to ask me frequently, let me take the opportunity to learn the latest and most advanced elemental knowledge, and become interested in ‘element’ and spectral analysis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a moment, Felipe clasped his hands and exposed the left hand of the little finger. He looked at Lucien seriously: "I If you want to teach Mr. You must have deep accumulation and insight in the field of elemental magic, so I am allowed to talk about this topic with you, arrogant and not measuring the level of knowledge of your own elements. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien concealed his sudden relaxation, discussing arcane and discussing elements is much better than discussing the Magic Council and discussing the Holm Kingdom! In addition to knowing from the mouth of Natasha that there is no common sense that Holm has no food, I don’t know anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Felipe didn't ask about the Magic Council and the Kingdom of Holm. It seems that there is no doubt about my identity. I don't think it is necessary to waste time on it. After relaxing, Lucien began to speculate on Felipe's intention: "He did not knock on me to participate in the death banquet, but instead discussed arcane. This shows that the topic is more important."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it important? He is a powerful Necromancer, what is the important thing about the Arcane in the elemental field?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Does he want to test my depth of knowledge, or the level of arcane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having experience with the Aalto magic circle, Lucien quickly associates It’s here. Knowledge is equal to strength, and younger magicians who grew up in the magical parliamentary education style may be even more so! As long as Felipe roughly judges his level of arcane, he can also speculate on his own strength range, as a direct reference! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To verify a person's level of arcane, it is natural to discuss the latest and most current knowledge in the field he is best at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way to relax, every sentence is facing the test of life and death." Lucien guessed the purpose of Felipe and made clear about his situation. The judgment has become more and more calm, and at the same time, it has also reflected the similar psychology that has increased more and more since it has repeatedly gained a lot of rewards from adventure and boldness. This encounter is a great deal for yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Felipe did not discuss the construction principles and models of the middle-level elemental magic, or else I can only pray for luck if I first progress to this step. On the contrary, it is an arcane that is basically lower than the magic level. I have a solid foundation and deep knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, two hostile magicians Between, certainly will not discuss the specific structure of the magic, because that is to give each other enhanced strength! So the arcane theory of arcane is a better choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, are you not sure about the arcane knowledge in this area?" Felipe saw Luthern briefly silent, and his eyes fluttered with a pale flame. The tone asked dangerously, if the professor refused to answer, it seemed to represent his guilty conscience, and the strength of a young magician who could not keep up with the trend of the elemental field was limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the professor’s strength is stronger than himself, then he will do it directly, and will not talk to himself at all, can become the current situation, explain The professor also fears himself and can't figure out his true level. Therefore, he will certainly try first, instead of tempting himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien chuckled: "I just have some research on spectral analysis. However, Mr. Felipe, I think it is best not to discuss too. Deep, because knowledge is valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chemical phenomenon of spectral analysis belongs to the content that Lucien has reviewed through the Soul Library many times, and its principle needs The atomic knowledge is barely understood. Moreover, it seems that the elemental (chemical) research in this world is still at a stage where it has not entered the micro level, or relies on various irregular means to try to discover new elements. In the old saying of Lucien’s last life, he said, “I don’t know why.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of it, Lucien’s Soul Library, after he became a formal magician, also changed a bit, that is, the sealed book was unlocked, exactly The less knowledgeable part of the sealed book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was in a dangerous lock, Lucien had no time and no time to discover this change until he really started traveling, trying the formal magician’s astrological meditation. It was strange to see the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This probably confirms Lucian’s speculation that the seal should be the suppression of the world’s original strength, only with the strength of his own spirit and soul. Counterbalance and unlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. Although I hate the will of the element, but as a good-looking arcane master and magician in the 'Pale Hand', I still have basic The bottom line will not spy on Mr. Professor's research results." Felipe's pale flame disappeared, and Lucien's relaxed attitude made him feel bad, and it seems that the professor really has a high level of arcane. According to common sense, the level of magic is often higher than the level of arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
