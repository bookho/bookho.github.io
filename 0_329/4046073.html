			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unprecedented and enthusiastic response, unprecedented success, except for the silent standing on the side of the Rhine, this is the most direct evaluation of this concert by other musicians, that crazy And the continuous applause is incomparable to every concert they participated in, and the masters of these applause still rule Aalto, sponsoring the musicians' aristocrats, and the authority of the music industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these musicians are highly musical literate, and several of them can also be called performers. They have a good or bad symphony of fate. The basic judgments have their own expectations for the final result, so they are infected by music and a warm atmosphere, and they are more excited than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of success, because of the wish, Victor is very excited and embraces Rhein forward: "Thank you, Mr. Rhein, without you to transform the piano, without your superb performance. Skills, this concert can't be so perfect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But the most important part of the concert is music, this is the glory of Mr. Victor and Lucien.” The seemingly silent Lue smiled and embraced Victor and celebrated the success of the concert at the Shenglu Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was enthusiastically embraced by cellist and a bearded brawny Thomas: "Mr. Evans, you can be Alto And even the most famous musicians in the entire continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respect, kindly, this is completely treated as a musician, which makes habits Lucien, who called the name, was a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rehearsal of the symphony of destiny began, Thomas and other musicians were very optimistic about the future of Lucien, who was more polite to him, but had not achieved anything. Well, it’s not enough for them to call Mr., but at this concert, Lucien received the unanimous admiration of the three most powerful people of Aalto, especially the great authority in the music industry. Princess Natasha's evaluation is very high, one is described as unparalleled, and one is the changer who calls Lucien the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that in the coming year, with the release of Music Review and Symphony Orchestra, Lucien will become a soaring music industry across the continent. The new star can be called a musician, even if he has not even played the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as long as he has a work above the standard level in the next two years, the status will be completely stable, even if the trend of this theme music is beginning to prevail, then Lucien will become the authority of the music community about this symphony, so the attitude of Thomas and other musicians to Lucian has changed by 180 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor embraces musicians in turn, thanking them for their cooperation, although the status and income of musicians is much higher than that of musicians, but a successful concert is inseparable. The cooperation of the musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Rhein went to Lucien and smiled and gave him a hug: "I can imagine that for many years in the future, this kind of sentiment expresses some kind of feelings. The theme music will definitely be more and more, and even become the mainstream of the music industry together with the religious theme, Lucien, huh, or you should call you Mr. Evans, you will be the pioneer of this trend."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of concert is a successful way of celebrating. Even if there is some dislike, Lucien does not reject it. He holds on to Rhein: "A piano can't be mastered." The Blazers? Hehe, Mr. Rhein, your violin has played a great level just now, but with a little less passion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s small language test While holding the Rhine, I feel that although the Rhine looks thin, the arms are very strong and powerful, and the body seems to contain a lot of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I am a quieter, not too intense person." Rhein loosened his arm and explained it casually, but not Lucien wanted to hear of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the hugs of the musicians, Victor embraced his students again, and Lucien did all of it as he did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The complete symphony of destiny is very good." When she embraced, Felice excitedly greeted Lucien with a red face, and the concert was a great success. Victor The status in the music industry will be significantly improved, which will be of great help to Felice's future roads. At the same time, his classmates are praised by three big figures, and Felice can already imagine himself being surrounded by other noble ladies and ladies. The scene of the inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Herodotus and Lucien hugged, they only said a little after silence: "You are very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Victor walked up with a smile In front of Lucien, he gave him the warmest and most powerful hug: "I don't know how to thank you, Lucien. My greatest fortune, and the Lord's gift to me, is that I have not refused to follow the words of me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you, I am very lucky." Lucien is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor looses his arm: "Yes, there is one more thing, the income of this concert will have half of you. Lucien, don't refuse, this You should get it. With this money, you don't have to stay in the Adejan area. Although poverty and suffering can inspire you, the pursuit of a better life is everyone's name, and it can also inspire. The Ade district is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucion’s knowledge, there are three in addition to the west grandstand and several boxes. One hundred and sixty-five seats are for the upper class. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the seat looks a lot, Aalto is the capital of the Principality of Vaolirit, the holy city of the church, the closest city to the dark mountains. It is the first line against dark creatures, pagans, and heretics. It is a bustling city on the mainland. Therefore, there are many nobles and pastors, and there are more ladies, sons, and daughters, plus the same number of musicians. Tickets are often in short supply, basically full every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for a large part of the aristocratic side, this is full, or else it will be a feat to spend a week to listen to the concert. The main reason for bankruptcy is that they only come to the St. Hall to book early when they need to communicate or meet their favorite musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a concert in the Hall of the Holy Land, the ticket income is 365 Jintala, this is a very large number, this is Victor near Four years of income, and a normal Knight Lord, only between three hundred and five hundred Jintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the rules of the Musicians Association, 40% of the ticket revenue is donated to the church, and 30% is used for the musician association’s operation and The maintenance of the hall, the remaining 30%, about 110 Jintal will be owned by the musicians, and the band’s expenses are also paid from this 30%, so Victor finally got the Jintal It will be between sixty to seventy Jintales, equivalent to his half-year income, showing the huge profits of the concert at the Shenglu Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor said half of Lucien, that is, Lucien will receive thirty to thirty five Jintales, which are ordinary civilians for decades. Even the wealth that can be smashed in a lifetime is equivalent to a three-storey beautiful building in the civilian area of ​​the Purple Lily District. It is equivalent to an ordinary, two-storey villa with a small garden and a small garden in the neighborhood of Jisu District. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also shows the cost of magic experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't refuse, thank you, Mr. Victor." Lucien answered honestly, and it seemed that there was a lovely, shining yellow glory. Coins, more than 30 Jintales means that you can buy 30 grams of moonlight rose powder, and you can rent a vacant villa for two or three years in Jisu District. The only problem is that Moonlight Rose is not bought if you want to buy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not why Wayne wants to leave the slum so quickly, but the current status and status have not allowed him to stay in the Adejan area, that It will make people suspect that he is hiding something, and his own teaching status has always appeared in the Adejan area. As soon as he leaves, it can guarantee safety. Besides, the villa can build a magic laboratory without being discovered, such as quiet. Underneath the room used to create music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien is also a normal person who pursues a better life and a more comfortable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celebrate the success of the concert, just as Felice is ready to invite everyone to their estate to enjoy the idyllic scenery of the "Harvest of the Harvest", one wearing black The middle-aged woman in the long skirt came in and was the powerful Knight of the Natasha Princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Camille." Felice, Lott, and Herodotus and other aristocratic children who had seen her and heard her deeds hurriedly and solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor and Lucien and others saw it and followed the gentleman’s etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
