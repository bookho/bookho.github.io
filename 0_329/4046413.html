			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of stagnation, Sophia reacted first. Through the "secondary spiritual connection" urged Frederick, who still has some reason to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are the Knights of the greedy devil possessed to fight for themselves, and the gold knight Midrande as a card, even if it is a high-level magician? Only can cause a brief panic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he may not be a high-level magician, maybe just as close as his brother Bayer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With confidence and confidence, after Sophia’s face changed a few times, she quickly recovered her calmness, still pure as water, confident and elegant, and at the same time, she pretended to be afraid Step back and step on a floating stone brick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From entering this hall, every place in Sophia Station, every line that is ready to move, has been carefully selected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of things is beyond expectations and must be cleared in advance! The thoughtful Sophia did not have the slightest wish and luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has just stood firm and has not yet applied magic, she saw the left hand of "Bolaq", an unusually beautiful sapphire ring suddenly brightens the color, together The deep rays crossed the distance and hit the body directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Sophia only felt that all his connection with magic was completely interrupted. Even if he could mobilize blood, he could only affect himself. The wave just disappeared when he left the body. Without a trace, even the connection with Frederick's soul was erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-magic ray?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia's beautiful green eyes suddenly contracted, confirming this "Secretly sneak into strangers" is a high-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the caster, she knows the horror of the high-level magician very well, even if the mind is sure, the legs will inevitably be a little soft, blurred dreamy eyes Looking at Frederick, tempting him to entangle this mysterious mage, "greed" the devil at least not as "disgusting", "painful" can not communicate, his princess identity, his own beautiful beauty, are greedy goals . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick made a harsh scream: "It’s all mine, it’s mine, you can’t take it away!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick blood mist emerged from the blood vessels and body that fell from the roots, wrapped him in it, like a bloody fog rushing toward Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Bayer was swept by the blood, and could no longer support his body. When his legs were soft, he fell to the ground and was green. The sword made a jingle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the outbreak of "Rage of Justice", Bayer has not had much strength, and it can only stand without support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to scare Sophia to attack, and to delay the outside knight to break the magical array of underground palaces, but Frederick turned out to be like a monster, not only Death, but more powerful, just when he was desperate to die, he found that "Bolaq" suddenly became a high-level magician, which made him see a glimmer of hope, whether it was a long battle between the two, or The high-level magician controls the audience, and they are better than their sisters and monsters. At least the high-level magicians can communicate and have no direct interest in their own interests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy of the enemy is a friend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the brink of despair, Bayer discovered that the resentment brought by "Rage of Justice" made him dizzy, and things in sight became increasingly blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His dark blue eyes are straightening, just like losing his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Frederick’s transformation into a bloody fog, Lucian’s right eye is deep and deep, like a starry sky, with countless stars running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basic standard of the Knights who have just reached the sixth level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good at fusion and engulfing. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood fog is a defensive spell-like ability, but it has a strong corrosion last name and melt absorption capacity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-ring star magic, "resistance analysis"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magician's spell recognition ability and monster knowledge accumulation, you can effectively judge and draw the approximate strength, good direction and weakness of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightning bolt just disappeared and disappeared. Denny wanted to cooperate with Frederick to attack Lusien, but the silver electric light was directly absorbed by the bloody fog. "swallowing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the blood fog is about to fall in front of him, Lucien’s faint light flashes away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood fog immediately recurs, the bursting sounds, the chaotic vortex emerges one after another, and soon split into countless small pieces, revealing inside A disgusting monster with no skin and blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-ring force field magic, "reverse vortex"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster screams, the blood vessels in all directions retract like a creepy tentacle, and at this time, the light purple ring of Lucien’s right middle finger is bright and dazzling. Rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, blue, blue, black, countless colors of light merge into a huge vortex to wrap the monster, tearing and destroying everything composed of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster's body is destroyed, and the monster's soul composition is also disintegrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "element vortex" disappears, there is only one broken blood vessel in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, these blood vessels began to squirm, as if to reconverge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is expressionless, his right hand is extended, his fingers are open, and the words with mysterious and mysterious meaning form a simple and vicissitudes of pages. Then the blood vessels burst open silently and the gasification disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council has its own magic, "The Demon Elegy!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Sophia's body trembled slightly, Frederick, "greed" the devil is so simple to be killed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How powerful is this high-level magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little bit of blood on her face, and she turned back and looked at the entrance to the hall, but there was no one there. Denny took the sword and dragged the shadows. In front of her, although the fear is firmly toward Lucian, a defensive posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm, I want to calm down, I want to seduce him, I want to convince him, I want to delay to the arrival of Lord Midalun, Sophia is trying to tell herself, Do your best to overcome your fears, calm yourself down and find ways to get rid of the dangerous situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the pillar of glory, she immediately defeated all kinds of emotions, and once again restored the wisdom and calm attitude, just as she was ready to sign the magic contract, share the sun king Treasures, the glory of the crown will never be shot, let the proposal of its safe departure to persuade the mysterious magician who turned into "Bolaq", his face changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten swallowed his head in difficulty, watching the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets easily kill the Knights of the Heavens, the unusually mysterious and horrible "Bolaq", almost smashed to the ground, he Who is it? Why can you mix in? Will he help Borak to deal with himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the will of the great knight, he defeated the fear and stood strong, but did not know the attack, or waited for the trial of "Bolaq." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to him, Jocelyn muttered to himself: "Is he fake? It turned out to be fake! No wonder Borak suddenly became calm, elegant and funny. Powerful, very attractive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of praises, listening to Alten, it is inevitable that a little bit of acidity, you have so appreciated this fake blog Lack, is he still thinking that he will defeat me as the Earl of Goldeneye and then inherit the title of Duke of the Gorse? Is it still thinking that he will go to the pure and beautiful Princess Sophia, become the king, and finally get the empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien used the demon elegy to destroy the "greedy" devil, and slowly walked towards her with a gentle smile that made Sophia flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This magician, let's work together, this will save you from leaving the underground palace without any danger." Sophia smiled sweetly, Pointly and pitiful, talking and talking, her eyes revealed a kind of joy that ordinary people could not detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of Lucien, Alten’s face suddenly had a strange smile, a cyan blood vessel swelled and quickly turned into a dark red . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah...Hol...Joseline discovered that after the change of Alten’s horror, his heart was extremely frightened, but the screams had not yet been issued, and they disappeared into the throat, then A twisted dark red blood vessel stretched out from her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joserine’s eyes disappeared quickly, with unbelievable doubts and astonishment and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Alten’s face is even more strange, and the “greed” devil is so good to destroy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lucien, who was facing him, suddenly gave a silent, cold light, and hit him without any mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alten immediately produced a crystal ice layer, and the whole portrait was frozen into a humanoid hail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a clear reflection of the hail, flowing with gorgeous colors, just seeing it, it seems that there is a cold immersed in the heart, freezing the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the frozen Alten, Sophia’s sweet smile is as frozen and stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail melts at an extremely horrible rate, Alten’s physical soul, and the projection of the greedy devil are also melted like ice, disappearing completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Sien never thought about using the "Elemental Swirl" and "Demon Elegy" to kill one of the most mysterious seven devils from the beginning, just now In order to paralyze it and re-integrate it into the flesh, at this time, the "silent hail" that can freeze the soul is its nemesis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the little crystal and praise the experience it offers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Frederick is a monster that cannot be controlled?" Denny is more concerned about his changes than Alten was frozen. Let him smell strange and wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the remaining aristocratic children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s lips tremble, revealing the pity of weakness, this high-level magician is too dangerous and terrible, and he and Frederick face him like Children face adults, and there is almost no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of fear made her not hear Denny's question, and looked back at the entrance to the hall to find her last pillar, the strongest card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze is bright, like a star, so beautiful that people can’t move their eyes, she clearly sees a dry, tall and thin white at the entrance to the hall. The old man, wearing a white shirt, tight trousers, and new brown riding boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Midranden, there are evil wizards coming in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia is like The bullied child ran to Miranda, the crown of glory, and did not worry that he would be attacked by the back. This distance is almost non-existent for the 9th-level gold knight, and he is already in his protection! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midalen’s mouth twitched, showing a slightly painful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia just got rid of the great fear, it was the time of extraordinary joy and relaxation, just waiting for Lord Midranden to kill everyone here, things will be solved It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a familiar figure was in front of her, pierced by a sharp black spike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deni?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia stares blankly at the delicate Denny, his eyes moving In front of me, I found my own pillars, and my own card, "Glory of the Crown", was full of pain and smile on his face, surrounded by thick black fog, a painful face in the dark fog, with Andris There is Duda! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
