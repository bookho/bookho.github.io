			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After giving birth to a gift, do you like it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s voice is slightly hoarse, hard Let yourself look elegant and elegant. If nothing happens, her heartbeat can't help but speed up. I want to pass through, as if I want to shake the silky tension hidden in my heart, will Lucien like it? Will it accept? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Queen’s Majesty, the brave knight, this time she is difficult to calm down, not as active and domineering as the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if he refuses me, I will not give up and will conquer him one day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Natasha quietly made up her mind to inspire morale and told herself not to talk about heroes in a success or failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt that there was one more palm on her waist and her back, and there was a dull voice from Lucien:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like it, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand on the back is violently forced, Natasha is not Unexpectedly, the body leaned forward and leaned on Lucien’s body, seeing the pair’s lost depth, as if they had set off the eyes of the wind and waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...but not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Natasha still didn't understand the meaning of this sentence, her mouth was blocked by Lucien, and she felt his hot breath spray on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**The thin lips are separated by the hard sucking of Lucien, the sweet mouth is firmly penetrated by the tongue, and it is looking for a bold and unrestrained partner before looking for it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔? Natasha seemed to understand something, her eyes closed slowly, her face was filled with joy and excitement, and although it was dark, it seemed to be completely illuminated by the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s feelings of repression for a long time, the kiss is unusually wild, but the heart still remains uneasy, Natasha is really just a gift? Nothing else? Is it wrong with yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;忐忑, expectation, restlessness, nervousness is like being thrown into the pot, and it becomes a bowl of unspeakable emotions. Lucien slows down the speed. Waiting for the answer given by Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien felt that the delicate and smooth tongue was entangled with himself, it was so hard, so sweet, and even tried to reverse Into his mouth, while the two palms hold their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, Lu Xien seems to have a fireworks bloom, brilliant, Natasha's answer is unreservedly expressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mind is connected, the tongue is getting more and more intense, I don’t know how long it takes, the two talents are panting apart, and there seems to be a silver wire between the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants to talk, Natasha with flushed cheeks and spring eyes, a look of joy, pink tongue licked his lips: "Lu Xi Well, you are better than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was awkward, it was Natasha, but this is her favorite. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha breathes a little rush: "After overcoming my psychological resistance, I realized that I have long liked you, no, Lucien, I have to be serious. Tell you the truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful eyes of her silver-purple are serious and serious: "I love you, I hope we can try to get along, hope to be with you. Sharing the future life together until death does not change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a girl with emotional experience, Natasha is very clear, confession must be such a thing When both sides have a good foundation and the relationship is almost certain, otherwise, a stranger who can't even talk about it, the confession will only scare the other party, and the person who is willing to accept is not greedy for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly felt that his hard-working dating plan was so poor that he had been "thrown" into the trash before he came in handy. Even the confession of this matter was directly done by Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the words "not to fall in love for the purpose of marriage is a rogue", Lucien expressed his serious attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles and blooms beautifully, and the feeling that he likes a person just like him is the best feeling in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed to be a little tired at the moment, so her feet were separated, and Lucien’s shoulders fell quickly and sat directly on Lucien’s On the leg, then a hint of doubt and eccentric expression was revealed, and Lucien explained slyly: "This is a normal reaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, The wasted atmosphere was destroyed a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha woke up and twisted her waist. She saw that Lucien’s expression became strange, and then her head stretched out, exhaling like a blue, on the road. Sean’s ear is low and dumbly fascinating: “The big Ivan of Lucien?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well.” Lucien’s face was red, I don’t know what to do. Pick up the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s mouth opened, and it contained Lucifer’s earlobe, letting the feeling of numbness spread his body, then let go of his mouth and laughed. Get up: "I like your reaction, don't be shy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is angry and sullen, also contains Natasha's white earlobe, gently Sucking up and seeing her body tremble slightly, a bright red rose from the neck to the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is her sensitive point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also like you to me like this." Natasha was so foggy, no shame, said directly, then curious and happy smiled: "You said You liked me a few years ago. When I pursued me, how can I not feel it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am worried that you only like female surnames, so I am Slowly cultivate your feelings and try to change you." Lucien answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and seemed a little touched: "Lu Xien, I still like female surnames, but there is only one in the world, no name. It won't be uncomfortable to get in touch with your body. Like I didn't like men to kiss me, but when I face it, there is no rejection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; While saying that she reinforced the persuasively twisted the waist, let Lucien endure hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, since you are trying to cultivate your feelings, then this oyster party should have plans too? Is it because I don't confess, you will take the initiative?" Natasha seemed to like Lucien's patience. The waist slowly but twitched, and she smirked and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s brain was congested, and he replied honestly: “Well, prepared, and made a plan, from the initial preparation of ingredients, to how to guide Topic, how to play the piano, how to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stunned, she just asked casually, did not expect Lucien really have Plan, then ask in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I didn’t check it out, I’ll say this anecdote. Lucien had to carefully retell the plan and end up saying: “There is no result. It comes in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed and said: "This is really your name, it’s so interesting."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing and laughing, the voice came to an abrupt end, her eyes became dark and deep, slightly hoarse and authentic: "But I like it, I like it very much, I like it very much!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien feels that Natasha is getting a hot breath, looking at her eyes, understanding her current touch and joy, he has never experienced this situation suddenly I felt that the plan was not useless. Although the content above it was not used, the plan itself succeeded in impressing Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood became sweet and happy, but it was immediately broken by Natasha’s declaration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, let's have a baby!" Natasha seems to be a little uncomfortable with that kind of affectionate state, and quickly converges and exalted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien almost sprayed her face, this progress is too fast, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
