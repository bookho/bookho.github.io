			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Click on the last day of the week to ask for recommendations~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.................. ..............................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is reluctant A smile is revealed: "Maybe because it is Lata Summer Palace, maybe because it is facing the Princess of the Princess, I feel nervous and uneasy, please forgive me for my restraint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight relief in the heart of Lucien: "I finally asked out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha felt impatient and upset And the tension, both of them are disguised by Lucien himself, so that Natasha is asked to ask this question to test some things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked a thick but beautiful eyebrow: "Because of the identity of my princess and the countess? Lucien, men must be discouraged by men." You can respect others, worship others, and fear others, but you must not cringe. This is the spirit and pride of every man and every knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My Royal Highness, I will try to change. I think I am facing your nervousness and uneasiness. It is more from my identity and narrow insights from the poor." Lucien was attitude and language of Natasha. Slightly shocked, but quickly said a prepared excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha suddenly laughed, not charming, but the atmosphere is beautiful: "In fact, you are much better than most people, at least for the first time. Facing me, I can express my meaning smoothly and completely. Perhaps Lu Xien did not find this potential. Hey, the first time I saw Silvia, I could watch my legs intently. Lucy, your daring is really admiring me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because Lucien did not bother to disturb Silvia, even There was no conversation. Natasha mentioned the previous incident and did not show any anger, but instead had a taste of ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was the first time I saw stockings, some sinister, in fact I am not a satyr." Lucien explained slightly with a distress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s left corner of the mouth, a look I understand very well: “This by-product of the ancient magical empire alchemy gives people a dreamy feeling, Ladies and gentlemen are 'like' items, oh, it seems that you are no exception. But because the magic empire has been destroyed, this material can only be produced in some places, even ordinary aristocrats can not get."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can understand your Royal Highness Princess." Lucian nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked at Lucien with a smile: "But it’s not like you, but no, Lucine, you are not a satyr." ?? Lucine’s embarrassing explanation made her have some bad taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I haven’t even taken the girl’s hand." Lucien had to respond with the tragic facts of this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha said with a long sigh: "I am unfortunate, I have read your information, it is already seventeen years old. Oh, Lucien, actually After the concert, many girls are interested in you. Do you need me to introduce one to you? Although they will eventually marry the nobles, there is a pre-marital, romantic memory that is also good for memories.” It’s the kind of joke The tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, thank you for your kindness, I don't need it for a while, I want to devote myself to music in recent years." Lucien refused seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he looks like this makes Natasha’s play more interesting. It seems to be awkwardly distorted: “I don’t need to introduce it, it’s hard road Xien you are Want to pursue it yourself?” Then she raised an eyebrow. “Need me to teach you some ways to pursue the girl? Silvia’s little wild cat was me...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough, Camille's cough sounded in time, interrupting Natasha's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, why should we discuss such a strange topic?" Lucien felt that Natasha was very approachable, had no shelves, and it was very easy to communicate, but the topic Always slipping in the inexplicable direction, giving yourself a strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are a lady, Princess Royal." Lucien finally understood where the problem was. It was obviously a dialogue between two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha spread his hand: "You can treat me as a gentleman. In fact, I can teach you how to pursue a girl more than most of my husband. Ok, let's continue to discuss music." She saw that Lucien's face was a bit dark and had to end the topic for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s rare that Lucien is not like other nobles in this matter, and does not show resistance or nervous attitude, so she is very satisfied, finally there are men I can talk to her about the "gentleman" topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed with relief: "We just discussed some tips at the end of the music..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I have a question." Natasha interrupted Lucien's words, a good student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was very dedicated and very serious and asked: "What is the end skill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You really don't need me to guide you how to pursue a girl?" Natasha laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Lucian had to pretend not to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour passed quickly, Natasha suddenly came to the inspiration, recorded the melody on the white paper of the music stand, and Camille stood up and sent Lucian went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes don't just say it to others." Camille sent the road to Sean and looked at the front and said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used lunch, Lucien’s mood rose slightly to Victor’s home Wait patiently for the arrival of Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he told the housekeeper Ace: "Mr. Ace, there are a lot of mosquitoes in the harvest month. This time is especially horrible. You sprinkle some sulfur in the hall to drive away. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Mr. Evans." The housekeeper Ace is always the most valued etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis also seems to understand Lucien’s mood, going out half an hour before the usual time, except for Lucien, she is the first Arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing Lucien to the corner of the hall, avoiding the maid, Felice took out a black bag like a deep night with several embroidered The beating flame mark: "This is forty grams of moonlight roses, they must be preserved by this special bag. This is my bag, but I can't use it for a while, you should hold it first, wait for moonlight rose. Give it back to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Felice." Lucien resisted the excitement and took the bag of this trait. Open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a glittering silver shimmer powder, which has a dreamy beauty under the black bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of the mat, Lu Xien estimated that there is not much deviation, the bag is tied, hidden in the clothes lined pocket, the material is now ready Qi Qi: "Fillis, Quintal, I will return it to you as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice answered with the most standard etiquette smile: "Of course, this But my private savings." Then she pumped her nose. "Why is there such a heavy smell of sulfur?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were a lot of mosquitoes, I told Mr. Ace. Sprinkled, but will soon be blown away by the wind." Lucien seems to care less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon’s study, Lucien even told himself To be calm, and on the surface, it’s still very good, but more mistakes than ever before show that Lucien is actually not calm. Victor has no criticism of Lucien’s state because of the concert. After the mood is relaxed, it takes time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
