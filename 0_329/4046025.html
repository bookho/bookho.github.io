			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No surprises, as Luthian expected, in the four hours after dinner to sleep unconsciously, he only interprets the magic notes There are more than ten pages in front of the content, and the words are not continuous, there is no way to form a complete sentence, because many words involving magic are very uncommon and rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, with the ability of Lucien to study for many years, these words can really restore and brain to fill in the meaning of some sentences, but certainly not accurate enough, according to this Understand that Lucien can't dare to start learning magic with the rash, and he doesn't know how to die. Fortunately, as a magic note, the witch will record his thoughts and some of the things he encounters while recording the magic he learned. It is like a book. Remember, and the words in this part are not uncommon, and the grammatical structure is the same as that of Lucien. Let Lucien smoothly interpret the similar sentences contained in the previous ten pages, and roughly know the other two magic notes, or It should be called the origin of magic books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch was born into a family of magicians who survived the destruction of the ancient Ilvanas magical empire. This family, although occupied from Aalto, lived in a remote mountain. In the old fort, the whereabouts are hidden, but under the hundreds of years of attacks and raids by the church, the population is still getting less and less. If the church has been attacked and searched for a little more than a hundred years ago, I am afraid that this family has already Desperate, but even so, to the generation of the witch, only her family and her family are left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an accident called "the creature represented by the words that Lucien does not know", the witch became an orphan and officially inherited The book of the Astrology and Elements, "The Common Things Related to Magic," are two magic books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only so many descriptions of the witches in the first ten pages. So the next morning, when Lucien wakes up, the first idea is that : "The best witch's magic notes are complete, no cut corners, or else I will go to the ancient hills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the current work that Lucien can find from the Copper Crown pub is mostly related to the Aaron gang, Lucien is unemployed again. It can only be supported by savings in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this coincides with the intentions of Lucien, John, and Joel, that is, let Lucien first concentrate on learning the text for a while, avoiding the possibility of coming. revenge. After all, Joel and Eliza are either street performers in the administrative district, or cleaning clothes in powerful guilds, and Ai Wen can follow Alice to the textile guild to help with little money, and nothing to do with Aaron gang. Intersection, only Lu Xien, if you start doing things, it is difficult to jump out of the market area where Aaron is very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they asked John Lucien to leave the city during this time, they could not go to a secluded place, and at night they were careful to be sneaked into the house by fear of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien got up and washed his face, and after eating soft brown bread in boiling water, he had a leisurely feeling of nothing to do. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is just an illusion, Lucien quickly slouched and went out to find an open space in the Adejan area, and then according to John’s teachings, Start exercising and come to the body and practice the basics of the sword with a wooden stick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucien, the best way to meet the dangers you may encounter before learning magic is to work hard to strengthen your strength, even if John has already said If you don't exercise from a young age, and then start at the age of sixteen, there is basically no hope to stimulate the blood and gain grace, unless you get the "water of the light" given by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien also has Jackson’s dagger, and he can fight for it at a crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already nine o'clock, and Lucien returned home, took a short break, and began to review what she learned yesterday, and tried it last night. The harvest, the diligence and the consciousness of the magic notes are unprecedented, far more than ever before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall at 12 Sneew Street, Jisu District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor looked at Lucien unbelievably: "You haven’t really studied text before, whether it’s pronunciation, spelling rules or grammar?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time that Victor has been surprised by Lucien's performance, so that other students can't help but look at Lucien again. Is this poor boy a genius of language and writing, or is he deliberately lying, in fact, he has a certain foundation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Victor, I did not really learn the text before, but when I was studying, I accidentally thought that I could be associated with the pronunciation, habits, etc. I usually talked to. After comparison and reference, I can learn so fast." In Aalto, Lucien wants others to regard himself as a genius, but does not want to regard himself as an incomprehensible monster. If it causes the attention of the church, it will be troublesome. I am not busy talking about my own learning method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the method used by Lucien, but without the help of library assistants and text books to try to interpret Learning speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is a civilian, but his father is already a good violinist, and he has been appreciated by many nobles. He has been learning linguistics since he was a child. After listening to it, after nodding, he nodded and praised: "Very good, very good, you can make good use of the advantages of idioms and sum up methods to prove that you are very smart, and very talented in this area. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His satisfaction with Lucien is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herodotus, Colin, and Renee look at Lucien’s gaze with a hint of envy and envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Victor for five years, there is no problem in lingua franca, and even the music is not low, Lott, Felice, very Seeing Victor’s praise for the students, I couldn’t help but look at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His method sounds very useful." Felice clasped her hands and placed it on her legs, sitting in a dignified and ladylike manner, nodding slightly. Keep a slightly proud attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lott was going to shrug his shoulders, but immediately thought of how this was no aristocratic movement, if he was with other familiar companions or the civilian girls around him. There was nothing at the time, but sitting across from him, but compared with his own temptation to try music scores, but also stingy and ironic, so he just smiled and whispered: "Speaking for so many years of lingua franca, there is this The idea is normal, and this method can't be used to learn music, right? Felice?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You thought I would be so naive, so Childish? Besides, I have my own way of learning music. Unlike someone, I always rely on that talent. I don’t want to use my heart. I’m going to spin around in a woman’s pile. Lott, I think you should understand that talent is not profligate for a long time. Felice showed a standard smile, eight white teeth were neat and beautiful. "If this, well, it seems to be the poor people of Lucien, start learning music, maybe it will exceed you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naluxien irony Lott sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, apart from Lucien, a guy who has no common sense, and who knows that he just wants to learn words and change his life, Joel, John, etc. People, including Yan En, Victor, Lott, Felice, Renee, etc., all think that Lucien wants to develop in the direction of music, because once they choose to study the text, it often means choosing the future road. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you want to be a clerk of a village court or an administrative officer of a city hall, you will definitely choose scholars in law and history when you study language and writing. Not a musician like Victor. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for a simple scholar, not a noble person, or a small group of people close to the aristocracy, can not be recognized, even if it is very dependent on its own strength The music path, which has not been praised, recognized or sought after by the nobility, cannot be called a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lott sneered aloud: "If it exceeds me, it must have surpassed you, Felice."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis was about to fight back, and suddenly saw Victor’s gaze coming over, so he took care of the long hair, buried his head and continued to look at the score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor affirmed Lucien’s talent, his teaching of Lucien speeded up, and soon combined the words to spell the rules, speak Part of the grammatical knowledge, which is in line with the mind of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
