			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be Maskin’s cover, no one has disturbed Lucien and Rhein during this time, so that they can survive the toughest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the mummy gloves can't be used, it's enough to have a shield of truth. At some point, the shield of truth is better." Sean took the shield of truth from the alchemy lodge and stuffed it into the mummies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the simple defensive power, the mummies are stronger, but the shield of truth is based on the defense of time and space, and it is less likely to be attacked by most Break, and it won't lower your mind like a mummy glove, which is definitely not a wonderful feeling for an arcane who is used to living by the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine restored the human appearance, finishing the bow tie and silver long hair, a state ready to attend the banquet: "In addition to the injury caused by the first monster, I also The recovery is almost the same, even if Ivan is encountered, it is not unsure of the whole body and retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will leave here soon, maybe it is 'God' Eyes 'Alvin.' Lucin checked the robe of the Arcanotians, the Moonlights, and the Ring of Congos, confirming that their condition is intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine gently nodded: "Although I am not afraid to fight Alvin now, the blazing angels must have a deep understanding of the world of the door. Once entangled, It may be besieged by six, and Heaven Mountain is nearby. The cost of summoning the projection of the projection will be reduced, and almost everyone will increase the strength of the half-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think Heaven Mountain is actually in the world of the door..." Lucien opened the black door and felt the slow flow of time, stepping out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein is closely followed: "In essence, Heaven Mountain is the best hope for most human beings after death, and it is also a kind of death custom. , oh, the deepest and deepest death and darkness, the most sacred and vigorous life and light..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't know if Heaven Mountain is naturally formed, or Related to their experiments with Tanos and Mr. Muskilllin..." Lucian said in his heart's speculation. At the same time, he knew that the star of destiny began to turn in the world, and that the black vortex that seemed to devour all the light reached the most In the front, all the trajectories are absorbed, deflected or disturbed, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein seems to have noticed something, go two steps, parallel with Lucien, look at him sideways "I feel that your fate track has become blurred and chaotic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Muskilllin is one of the most famous prophets of the astrology. Now I have the blessing of 'God of Truth' and 'Heavenly Mountain', which must be treated with caution, or else After this fan black door, we probably will see the 'Eye of God' Alvin waited to intercept us. "Lucien smiled, did not specifically mention the fate of things secretive person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a gray hall, Lucien and Rhein moved closer to the "mirror of fate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely got rid of Douglas, Fernando, who was suppressed by the "headless pope" Returning to the entrance according to the law of coordinate changes, all the way to Lu Xien left a lot of secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening a black door, Douglas suddenly looked around in confusion: "I feel the familiar breath."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not Lucien..." Fernando carefully distinguished and slammed openly. "It's the king of angels, Mekantron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "He appears here?" Douglas was a little unbelievable. "Is it the monster that changes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He runs the "Star of the Stars", The master of divination, this time joined the monster this variable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Douglas laughed and laughed at himself: "Eighty percent may be the king of angels, and twenty percent may be monster camouflage. What is the difference between using and not using astrology? I can judge this as normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that the monster's strength level is too high, seriously disturbing the prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing with the monster twice allowed him to have more confidence to escape in a dangerous situation, and he still couldn't worry about his student Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't worry about seeing Heaven Mountain directly here? Meet the god of truth?" Douglas joked. "The king of angels should just pass through this hall." Soon, we can try to track it, but we can't delay it for too long. If we don't gain it after ten minutes, we must return. Maybe Lu Xien is waiting for us at the entrance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good." Fernando understood that he was only looking for student Lucien by reason of tracing the king of angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not far from the lab of Tanos, along the way Actually did not encounter an enemy, it is not like us who have been unlucky after coming in." The coordinates of the Rhine calculation change are more and more skilled, hehe teasing himself and Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien remembered "Cao's past" and chuckled: "Mr. Rhein, can't assert too early, otherwise open this black door." Maybe you will encounter the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's mouth is pumping: "I won't be so miserable?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he pushed the black door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his expression changed, and the whole body collapsed, turning into countless small bats flying all over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long black giant python crossed the space and time with a sigh of sigh, and found his former position, and took the place It has a pale flame that melts the gray tiles into a weird transparent liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really met the enemy..." Lucian didn't know how to describe himself and the Raven's crow mouth, two floating in the gray hall. The legendary undead, a black hood and a black cloak, the face is undulating black gas, only the red flame-like eyes are clearly visible, one is a tens of meters long rotten dragon, the mouth is sprayed with gray The flame, "Death servant, dragon lich..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is the legendary third-order necromancer, the reaper of life, mainly in melee combat, but There are a lot of spell-like abilities, the latter is the standard caster, and the melee ability is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any hesitation and discretion, Lucien had a beautiful silver-white pocket watch on his right hand, and the thin bracelet was attached to the buckle with a hint of metallic luster. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click, Lucy’s thumb pressed the button slightly before the death servant and the dragon lich cast spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray inside reveals the white, the bat flying in the whole hall seems to be bound by the invisible shackles, and the giant servant who screams again is like a movie. In a slow motion, the dragon lich and the gray flame on its mouth are solidified in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large lysis, big lysing, Lu Xien did not go to the dragon lich, relying on its own and the monthly timepiece to store the instant nine ring magic crack Surgery, and with the "unsure hand" to cooperate, and then cast the "Evans's sea maze" with additional spell delay, uncertain hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Lucien turned into an epic knight, and took the sword of truth and went to the servant of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, you can't think about keeping the cards, how to quickly repel the enemy, solve the battle, how come! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale coagulation quickly dissipated, and the black-pressed bat group recovered first, and hula flew around the dragon lich, tearing its body and soul from all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singular scorpion swayed to Lucien and cut the illusory figure. Lucy had already held it at the end of the advanced time stop effect. The shield of truth has changed its position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death servant black cloak above the dark black, Lucien's big cracking lost its effect, suddenly, deep black burst, fireworks bloom, a lot of roads One of the "Hands of Uncertainty" has finally worked, destroying the spell-like defensive layer of the servant of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the servant of death screamed the sound of countless items, so that Lucien was quite sad, and at the same time regretted not learning "luxury cracking". Otherwise it will not leave a black cloak, except for the legendary item, it will be stripped clean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
