After Lucien confirmed the safety, many of the primary alchemy plaques carved on the stone table were opened with spiritual power. Then, from the box that applied the "Save Organs" magic, take out a tube of wraith dust, three black diced mushrooms, a dark black still crawling water ghost brain tissue and some other auxiliary materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magic effect of twenty-four hours has passed, with the help of cryolite and other materials purchased by Lucien, the water-brain brain organization does not appear. Broken signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lucien’s measure to prevent himself from being able to apply the “Save Organs” magic every day because of the delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on gloves and pick up the sterling silver dagger, Lucien picks a black nectar from the weighing alchemy:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6.72g."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While jotting down the weight of this black guilloche in the Soul Library and calculating the use of other materials Volume, Lucien put it in a glass dish engraved with magic runes, and then took a dry glass beaker to call its own weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour the wraith dust into this beaker, Lucien observes the change in the weighing alchemy, until these transparent shimmering dust has 3 grams It stops only around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the same method to weigh out ten grams of moonlight rose, Lucien wore a white gloved hand and picked up the silvery sterling silver dagger, gently The ground is cut on the dark black water brain tissue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a water-brain brain that keeps a lot of bugs twitching, creeping up, it feels like a great danger, cold and creamy The feeling of nausea is transmitted to Lucien's brain through the fingertips of the glove, which is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless water ghosts and wraiths in the eyes of Lucien, their rotten skin and muscles, bloody teeth, and stench Feel horror and nausea. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien was cold and cut without shaking, and cut the delicate internal structure along the complex texture of the brain tissue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghosts of water and grievances disappeared, and the squirming of the water-brain brain tissue returned to its original level, and it continued to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the weighing of the alchemy and sterling silver daggers and determining the weight of the cut brain tissue, Lucien will have a thick casserole-like black vessel. Take it over and put it on the flame alchemy array and start adjusting the flame size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame is stabilized in golden white from dark red through deep red, orange red, golden yellow and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien first threw the black corpse into the vessel, added a small amount of water, and then stirred it with a glass rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black turkey is not like other plants, it will coke and burst at high temperatures, but will melt a little bit, and the rotten smell will gradually spread, but But it was bound by the alchemy array in the vessel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the black, viscous liquid rolled out of the bubble, Lucien’s hand added the Wraith Dust and Moonlight Rose Powder in an unusually stable manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tengland, when the three materials are in contact, a lot of black and silver smoke is emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke keeps expanding and contracting, as if there are countless souls fighting in it, a burst of screaming screams are coming into Lucien’s ears, so that Lucien begins to have Slight nausea and vomiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and silvery smog began to slowly condense and condense, presenting a pale, seemingly dead but not rotted human skin with a chill and shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the smoke condenses into a strange pale waterdrop, and Lucien sees the opportunity to use the sterling silver to dagger the water ghost brain tissue. Lost in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale water droplets in the vessel are like magnets, all integrated into the dark black water brain tissue, just one second, the water ghost brain tissue It disappears strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature of the entire magic laboratory suddenly dropped and became gloomy. The pure white flame burned a hint of gray, making people unable to say anything. Heart palpitations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retired three steps in the empty laboratory, the internal organs rolled, extremely disgusting, almost fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is attacked by a certain intensity of infrasound, refining the 'cry soul' and such a change?" Lucien stepped back unsteadily. While holding back the dizziness, judge the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the hard mantra came out of Lucian’s mouth, a transparent ring wall surrounded by Lucien, a ripple that swayed on the wall ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Muffler Barrier"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After blocking the subsequent attacks, Lucien resumed for a few seconds and continued to perform "lighting". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright ball of light appears in the open laboratory, under the strong light, you can see the dense white face of the vessel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These faces are very transparent and vague, they can barely see the five senses, but they exude a strong sense of sin and sinister, and are working hard to break free from the alchemy. I want to go inside the body of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like a pure grievance, but something like a mixture of spirit and curse. If you get into the body, I’m afraid it’s going to be miserable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glare-like magic similar to brilliance appears with the curse of Lucien's mystery, under the superb of their strong illumination, these sinister The fuzzy face gradually disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lab returned to normal, Lucien saw only a small amount of residual black liquid left in the vessel and gave off a strong burnt smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Crying Soul' formula translated on the Witch's Magic Notes should be error-free. It may be that some restrictions she feels are not important and cannot be encountered, so No translation. It almost killed me.” Lucien took off his gloves and wiped the cold sweat. “You have to find the opportunity to learn the words of the ancient magic empire in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I did it according to the recipes and processes recorded by the witch. The only difference is that the water brain tissue I use is mutated. It is probably a problem here." Lucien thought and re-analyzed Formulation, process, made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Crying Soul" potion is an outstanding achievement of the ancient Sylvanas empire's necromantic magic. According to the witch's record, this formula is only a small number of magicians. Mastering, her ancestors were obtained after an accidental exchange, so it is a very precise formula, and a slight change in material may cause failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lucien’s mutated water brain organization is just a little more soul power, and there is no difference between the normal water and the ghost brain tissue, so Lucy En soon thought of a way to decide to refine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lucien used the black turkey with the deepest color and the best quality, and the process was exactly the same as the first time. It is the last step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a look at the pre-arranged "silence barrier" and trapped the trap of the spirit, calmly and calmly cut the water ghost brain tissue Throw it into the vessel and let it absorb the pale waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what! what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp, piercing cry came out of the vessel, full of stern and tragic feelings, but was offset by the silence barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
