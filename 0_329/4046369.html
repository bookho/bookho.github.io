			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as Bellac, the black ring on his right hand illuminates a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like all the brilliance of the two black-and-white entangled black snakes, turning into a secluded, deep ray, very fast, hitting just Responding to Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Douglas’s spell absorbing wall disappeared, and the high-level arcane badge’s constant “normal free action” effect disappeared, with the road to the center of the body, A small anti-magic force field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven Rings Magic, "Anti-Magic Ray"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a combat mage, Barack is more cautious than the high-level magicians such as Traquil, who was met by Lucien, and chose from the beginning. The magic of the surname inspired the best equipment, limiting the use of high-end magic items by Lucien, and making himself invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Element" ring can't be started, the magic of the construction is difficult to display, but Lucien is not the "first time" encountering anti-magic rays, and when the machine is upright, it goes to the side Throw away, intend to rely on speed, terrain, etc. to temporarily avoid, until the end of the short anti-magic ray effect ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellak sees Lucien’s body dragging the afterimage, the knight’s rank is quite high, don’t care, smile, put his hand in the way, Lucien’s front A high and transparent force field wall appeared immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Lucien, who had no time to turn, slammed into the wall of the force field, but under such a strong impact, the wall of the force field did not move, it seems that In addition to a few special magic, it is extremely strong against other attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not delay the time, leaping to the side by the rebounding force of the impact, and then ran around the wall of the force field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem with this five-ring magic is that it is not completely closed like a magic prison, just a wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can jump into the surrounding lakes, relying on the terrain to delay the attack, and the Bellac’s right index finger through the spelling buffer shoots a gray light, no matter How Lucien escaped, he could only watch it hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes became sluggish, and the place hit by the ray began to show a gray-white rock feel, just like the stone skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-white color expanded rapidly, but in a second, Lucien became a gray stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-ring magic, "Petrinization"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, the original devil, the original devil of the 53rd purification sequence is too weak!" Bellak hit a hand, his heart swelled and forbearance Can't stop satirizing a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a spy-watching night watchman who is under tremendous pressure all the time, and will not vent this opportunity, and sooner or later he will be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is ironic and ironic, other things can not be relaxed, a few consecutive magic, the petrified Lucien bounds tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mission is completed successfully and you can return to the night watchman team!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until this time, Bay Lark was completely relieved. After all, Lucien was the student of the storm who dominated the Arcanist. Who knows if he has strange magic items or triggered magic scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lucine, who had just dug out a stone from the mine, Bellak’s dark face showed a smug smile: “The order they gave was only The original devil who had the 53rd purification sequence, I directly captured him! Hahahaha, when the church burned him publicly in the holy city of Reims, will there be less rewards, honors, and rankings?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But have been hiding in the holy city of Reims for decades, Fernando’s anger is not for the people of Holm parish."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Holm, the night watchers are basically latent activities, and once exposed, they are easily killed by the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zi Lag Lake in the southeast of Rantat?" After the space countercurrent interference transmission array, the place where it appears is random, and it can be seen from the time it takes for space to jump. It should not be far from Rantart, so Bellak made a preliminary Judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he used the technique of reducing the magic, turning the petrified Lucien into a statue that can be held in his hand, except for the gray-faced side. "Lifelike"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, you have smashed the majesty of the Lord and are destined to be purified by the Holy Fire. Otherwise, I can ask the Pope to make you a statue of the Deity, placed in mine. As a collection in the collection room, you are the one with the highest ranking in the purification sequence I am hunting, and of course, the weakest one!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellak looks at the hand "The statue of Lucien" vents his own depression and arrogance. "Do you understand now? There is not enough magical strength to match, even if you make great achievements in the arcane, it is only illusory. Shadow, you may be caught and killed by my high-level magician with low arcane level at any time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low level of arcane is like he touches It hurts the trauma of my heart. "Why am I not good at arcaneism, I am secretly ridiculed by my classmates, teachers, colleagues, and other arcans as waste, idiots, and idiots? Even if my magical level is raised again and again, they seem to see To? The girl I like also puts in the arms of the guy I hate the most. Isn't the arcane level two levels higher than me? The magic level is a little worse than me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know, in an adventure, he was me When I secretly grasped the slow killing, how comfortable I was, and what kind of snot he was always on, he cried for help, even wanted to find a chance to send his wife to teach, the level of arcane is high, in fact Nothing to use!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien can still think, he will certainly ridicule his failure to be a man, sensitive and fragile. In the Magic Council, no one dares to face the magician with a high level of magic and a low level of Arcane. He is not optimistic about him at most. He thinks that his potential is limited and he may continue to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After venting a few words, Bellak forcibly converged his emotions, preparing to hide his body and fleeing into the Glorious Cathedral. Can not be delayed, the high-level elements of the will, the storm of Allinge, can be found at any time, use the prophecy to determine the scope to find over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are smug, and then suppress depression, Bellak will not completely lose his mind, but also know how to judge the situation and grasp the time difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever other magicians praise you as the best arcane master in the 100-year history of the parliament, the most promising younger generation of legendary magicians, I The heart is like a kitten tickle, can't wait to completely purify you, finally, finally let me wait for this opportunity! Lucien Evans, the original devil, elemental order, you are good before you go to hell Hey, remorse yourself is not focused on improving the magical power.” Bellak shook his head at the “Lucian statue” and his body gradually disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the corner of his eye saw the face of "The Statue of Lucien", and the gray corner of his mouth twitched slightly, showing a very strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously threw out the "Rossian statue", and broke it if it broke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is a step behind, and the mouth of the "Rossian Statue" squirts out a cone of scent, dark and dark, like a heart that keeps changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a close distance, Barak was completely unable to react and was sprayed directly by the cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barack's brain is paralyzed, countless thoughts roll, but how can not concentrate, the whole man is like a daze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange flash of light flashed over, Bellak disappeared in the same place, flashing the other side of the air, getting rid of the conical scent, the mind began to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the high mage armor defended his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six Ring Magic "Spell Trigger"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level magician deals with the powerful magic of assassination, raid, and dangerous situations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
