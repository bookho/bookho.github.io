			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top floor of a magic tower in Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio took the information gathered by other people in the "Pale Hand" and sighed softly: "The Holm Crown Award, he should be the most The young winner. Whether he can become a high-level arcane master in the future, he is destined to be remembered by history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he is smashing himself Tight neckline, seems to hope to have a beautiful talisman, but unfortunately after all, fighting and magic talent is higher than arcane talent, so many years of hard work has not been able to get the "immortal throne" award, can only look at Felipe, These latecomers to Lucien have won the highest honors in their respective fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing on the shoulders of giants, hey, standing on the shoulders of giants, 'Professor' I don't think I can get my students so fast. Erm Crown Award. He is still trying to concentrate on experiments, trying to artificially synthesize the life material with the meaning of the surname, and at the same time win the Holm Crown Award and the Immortal Throne Award. Haha, you will recognize this achievement and give him the award. Immortal Throne Award?" The undead Adolf sat on the sofa with his hand in his hand and a "sky blue". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t look at his lifeless horror face and the red flame of two jumps, you will definitely be a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have already investigated Richard Holson, the Holm Crown winner who is still alive below the high level, and can confirm that he is not a professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio sneered: "Look at whether his 'giant' can live until that time. No major awards will be awarded to the dead. Felipe has made significant progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he called in a pale hand and told him: "Will Lucien Evans? X's level of attention is raised to the same level as Larry, Timothy, and Ulysses, paying attention to his movements and promotion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Only because of the "professor" and the attention of the pale hands, they themselves began to receive their attention, but before his research may destroy the pale hand, the pale hand is only to increase the attention, do not bother to think Way to destroy him. There is not enough interest to kill a genius who can only say that there is potential growth. The gains and losses are very unbalanced. It is the worst one of all choices, and the highest panel of judges absolutely does not allow such a bottomless infighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the same time tell the person, continue to help find the trace of 'professor', we promised the 'lich conversion ceremony' will never repent." Rogerio Once again, I yelled at the core of the pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead on the sofa, Adolph, carrying a glass of swaying in the sky blue liquid, calmly watching Rogerio and the pale hand, sneer inside Road: "Stupid humans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the dark winter night, the alchemy arcs on both sides of the road are getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage rolled over a thin layer of snow and slowly traveled to the tallest building in the aristocratic area, "The Royal Tower of Holm" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachman jumped out of the carriage, carrying the dimly lit lantern, and respectfully opened the compartment door: "Mr. Evans, Mr. Lazar, to the Royal Devils Court in Holm "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a coachman who has been employed for a long time by Holm Royal Devils Court, he knows more about the magician than the average person, and is more awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished the double-breasted black long dress, Lu Xien stood at the door of the carriage, deeply sucking the cold and biting air, taking a few days of meetings The boring sweep came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepped into the magic tower with Lazar, and came to a middle-aged man on the head. His pale yellow hair combed neatly to the rear, the oil shined, and every effort was made to maintain a perfect posture: "Hello, Mr. Evans. I am the steward of Holm Royal Defence, Rodm, according to Lord Morris. Commanded to pick up potions, materials, or magic items worth 2,000 Arcane points. Right, are you here tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because The Royal Court of Erm has deep roots with the families of Hoffenberg and Ruiz, so the title here has a strong aristocratic taste and a stricter distinction between the upper and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Rodham, take me to see the magic items first, I still have a magic robe." Lucien nodded slightly. If there is room available, please arrange for me and my companion to stay here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it was already 8 o'clock in the evening, the bottom of the magic tower was very quiet. Only Lussien and Lazar reverberated on the slate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of people came down from the second floor of the Magic Tower, heading for the half-aged man wearing a black coat and wearing a crimson double-breasted long dress. Sean is inexplicably familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has an impressive pair of silver-gray eyes, because he and Natasha are like 50 or 60%, it seems to be a male surname. Natasha, who is getting old, but his face is very poor, pale and thin, and there is no feeling of Natasha's delicate skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a purplish red coat on the black coat and long dress, the outer layer is the cloud line, and the center is a crown with a sacred meaning. On both sides of the crown are a scepter and a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pseudo-herald scholar" Lu Xien recognized at a glance that it is the coat of arms of the Holm royal family, that is, the Hoffenberg family coat of arms, Na Tasha also has a similar pattern on some clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-step behind the Holm royal family is a middle-aged brown-haired man, who is graceful and long-dressed by his ball. The figure was bulging, with a black leather bag between the arms, and a chubby face with a charming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness." Rodham solemnly salutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only prince of the Holm Kingdom, the Duke of Edenburg, Patrick? Hofenberg, Meredith's brother, Natasha's aunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar and the probably guessed Lucian followed with a slight sigh, but not as respectful as Rodham, but a courtesy. There is no such strict ritual between the magician and the nobility, unless the magician is "supported" by the nobility, providing money, materials, etc. for him to conduct magic experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick gently returned to the front of the jaw, originally wanted to go directly to the gate, but the corner of the eye suddenly saw the luster of the right hand of Lucien, dreamy and beautiful The lilac gemstone ring, then opened with a hoarse voice like a cold: "Holme Crown Ring? Are you Mr. Lucien Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Holm royal family is the most powerful and authoritative in several countries that support magicians, and is associated with many of their family members as outstanding magicians, especially the great arcian master. Therefore, the entire royal family attaches great importance to the magician's power. The natural genius of the genius magician who can get the highest honor in the magical field of the Holm Crown Award is to be gracious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiles and pays tribute: "I am honored to be remembered by His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Patrick's silver-gray eyes reveal a smile: "In recent years, it seems to be the world of Lucien Evans, a talented musician who opened a new era of music... One is a genius magician, the youngest Huo "The winner of the Erm crown award." When he talked about the talented musician, he suddenly paused, and then his mouth smiled. "Evans, do you want to join the Druid study?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Lucien didn't understand how Patrick suddenly asked this. Patrick smiled and nodded. "The land used for the experiment has been determined to be the small town of Sariva, which is directly under the royal family. Some of the soil is very poor. I will send people to tell the town officials to entertain you, cough, cough, cough and cough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly coughed up, as if he could not breathe Come, until his entourage took out the usual pale green magical potion into his mouth, he gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I thank your prince in advance for your kindness." Lucien was a little uncomfortable with Patrick's sudden enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick raised his hand: "The glory of the royal family is inseparable from the common support of the nobility and the magicians."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few words, Patrick was obviously in poor physical condition, so he left under the restraint of several knights. Before he left, he said lowly: "In the letter sent by Little Natasha, there is the latest moonlight sonata of the talented musician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;路Sean stunned, is this recognized? However, after getting the Holm Crown Award into a man of the storm, it is very possible to reveal the identity. Lucien never despised the ability of the church and the Magic Council to collect intelligence. He only hoped that Natasha could fulfill his promise. Look after Joel, John and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
