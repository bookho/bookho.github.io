			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the "end of the traitor", Lucien and the sage quickly left the home of Morningstar and merged into the darkness so as not to be blocked by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for the professor’s acting style, the referee that has experienced once is no longer strange and aware, so they doubt whether the professor deliberately appeared in the magic circle. In this way, the spies they placed were exposed to the fire, and the referee had already planned to use several spies as bait to arrange traps. The news of the Magic Council headquarters and the re-emergence of the professor will be transmitted to other magic circles through mercury. Those circles also have spies, and similar information is passed to the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the referee did not expect the professor to lock the morning star for the first time, and he was decisive in just half an hour after he secretly transmitted the information, apparently monitoring him. On the other side, the exposure of the sage's identity and the action of the clown let the person in charge of the referee believe that the object of the professor's trap is the clown, the chasing watchman, so the center of gravity is offset, and there is no time to arrange the trap, just arrange two ordinary The night watchman secretly protected and guarded, and was easily smashed by Lucien, killing the morning star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and the sage in the darkness secretly bent around, crossed several blocks, and came to a secret set by the sage in previous years. Hide in the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, I don’t think you are very good at necromancer except for the astrology and elements." The sage who was really relieved at this time exclaimed, The body has not reached the level of the quasi-chief, and his tone is very weak after he has lost too much blood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I witnessed Lucien’s magical array of dead spirits When one-third of the blood is mixed with the body of the broken limbs collected in the Black Forest and become a body that is no different from the real person, the sage is from the inner earthquake, which is completely touching the true god. The field has made him more and more fascinated by the magical magical magic, and he has strengthened his determination to go to the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien still pretends to be a hoarse voice, and smiles slightly: "It’s still far from being proficient, just starting to make up for this weakness more than a year ago. However, the parliament has made great progress in the research of human body refining. For example, the results of the cell memory surname I used can fully play the role of your blood, in order to teach the current magical effects in similar aspects, absolutely can not distinguish It is a fake corpse, unless the cardinal examines the priests of nine or more levels such as 'God' and backtracking scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a year Research, coupled with solid arcane and magical foundations, Lucien, who is already a four-ring magician, is no worse than the Hunter magic of the human body, and thanks to the advancement of arcane and magic. The human body is more realistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still far from mastery? What about the true mastery of necromantic magic?” Even if the body is weak, the sage can’t help but surprise. Question, then he thought of one thing: "Felipe Carneiro, who suddenly rose from the countdown to the 91st in the purification sequence more than two years ago, is a Necromancer, and when the ranking rises It was only a five-ring, and later promoted to a higher level. Is it the degree of his mastery that you are referring to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Aalto City Hall The "former" consul, the Viscount Klein, is qualified to learn more about the purification sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the Necromancer, you have to admit that he is very proficient." Lucien even had a nervous relationship with Felipe, and he did not arbitrarily devalue him. He was Necromancer is indeed a rare genius. And Felipe is already a high-level, even though many young magicians inside the Magic Council compare themselves to him, they still know the current gap between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of magic is more difficult in the future, especially in a few places. When the five rings are raised, they have begun to need the aid of magic rituals. There is not enough arcane and magic accumulation, and the failure rate is extremely high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucian transferred the topic: "Sage, I am sorry that I will involve you in this matter without detailed explanation, and the clown will not be true." Killing you, whether the night watchman and his interval are enough for me to save you are unknown, which puts you in great danger. I apologize for this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fear that the clown can ask for some details of the surname, Lucien did not give the sage a trap, just hinting that he will be very dangerous tonight, and he will save him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien gently squeezed his head. At that time, Camille was indeed nearby: "It is a bad thing to get you into a huge danger anyway. The items you get from Morningstar are left to you as a compensation." Don't refuse, this is the principle of my life. Well, take a break after taking the medicine, and then leave Aalto as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Professor I feel a lot easier now. "After becoming a formal magician, the pressure is getting bigger and bigger. The status of the governor and the status of the Viscount can not only bring him glory and enjoyment, but make him feel inexplicable. Panic, plus age, he has long had the idea of ​​throwing everything away to find the mystery of magic. Anyway, the family has been succeeded, so this suspended animation has helped him to be relieved in a certain sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the Lata Summer Palace, Natasha, a expression of indifference and indifference, embraced the grandfather Waotiit who heard the news. Reassuring him: "Father, don't worry about me, I will recover soon. Rest assured, have I suffered from the blows and tribulations? I think this is the test of the Lord, and the mother will love it in Heaven Mountain. Look at me, so I will live well, live happily, and live for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor little Natasha, I believe in you Tough, but don't be too embarrassed about yourself.” Waorit Grandpa touched her hair with pity, this child must be very sad, forget that her mother is a magician, how can the soul go to Heaven Mountain? However, Xiao Natasha is also very pitiful. She just came out from the closed heart, and the only two romances did not end well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let Dagong comfortably, at least his daughter and Lucien? Evans's love shows that she doesn't just like girls. At most, she hasn't had the chance to fall in love with her surname before, so don't force her too much afterwards, lest it develop in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, please allow me to be quiet for a while tonight." Natasha looked up and smiled "hard", and her heart was not so good. No one wants to deceive the loved ones, but their feelings are too deep, and so far, the feeling of the female surname is better than the male surname, so it is better to have a longer period of time to calm and distinguish the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wariott nodded and touched her hair again: "Natasha, I believe you can come out."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Natasha with Camille and several guards returning to the "War Gallery", the face of Vaoliet suddenly changed: "She won't be hit, Women and men don’t like it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the War Gallery, Camille sits quietly on the sofa, and Natasha is not very good. With the piano venting, the passionate melody reverberates repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best "sorrow" that I have heard you play, but can you stop and talk about what happened inside the villa, clown and vigil Did anyone find out?” A guard did not exit the room and stood by the piano, and teased Natasha in a very familiar tone, trying to make her feel better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha stopped her finger and took a deep breath, and calmed down: "Lu Xien, your dolls are well-made, they have no problems. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guard is the disguised Lucian, who bids farewell to the sage and quietly meets with Camille, under her cover with Natasha. Sneak into the Lata Summer Palace and hide in this seemingly dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very confident about the doll who used my quarter blood. I care about Natasha's performance, if you are sad and sad When I said "Love", I suddenly laughed, and things were completely messed up." Lucien understood that Natasha was in a bad mood because she deceived Dagong, so she made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha screamed twice: "Is that person who can't control myself? I think I can play opera at that time! But that's it. The role is a bit unsuitable for me, I should be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfinished, Natasha swayed and appeared directly in front of Lucien. Then the right hand presses the chest, the head is slightly buried, and the distance between Lucian's eyes is very close, using a man's gesture of "deep love": "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Whenever I see the moonlight, I will think of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head gaze, breathe audible, don't know why, usually used to joke like Lucien After seeing each other's beautiful and deep pupils, Natasha was a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
