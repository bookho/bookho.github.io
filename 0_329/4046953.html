			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, Fernando eagerly said: "Douglas, what mathematical problems are you studying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never been ashamed because he does not know, need to ask others, and when he encounters something of interest, he is extremely eager, and magical knowledge and mathematical problems are just like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has a warning magic array nearby, and has long known Fernando’s entry, but he is not concerned about this issue, still immersed in the ocean of mathematics until Fernando Opening, slowly lifted the head: "The calculation of the area and volume of irregular things, and the related problems arising from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered The feather pen in the hand did not stop, so the language was very written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after hearing this answer, Fernando’s eyes immediately became horrified, and the bright red eyes seemed to be two rounds of hot sun: “The area and volume calculation of irregular things And the related issues that have evolved from this? How do you deal with the curve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fundamental problem in the analysis of complex spell models, which has been difficult for generations. The magician is the most dazzling pearl in the magic crown. However, the results of previous research can only be used for special situations, and it is impossible to popularize it. This makes many magicians frustrated and even assert that there is no solution. It is better to spend more. More energy is on how to effectively improve mental strength, although the progress will not be large, but at least will soon see the return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Fernando’s heart will become turbulent and difficult to restrain, because from the papers, strange symbols, graphs, etc. Seeing that Douglas is farther than anyone else in this respect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this really solves the problem. No matter the middle, low order. Still high-level, legendary, analytical and inscribed spell models will be a straight line of difficulty. In the next 20 years, the magician's strength will be greatly increased! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas almost woke up from the study and smiled: "Yes, although it is always unrealistic to be jokes, I can’t help but study it." I think it contains the most beautiful scenery in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What angle do you think from?" Fernando blurted out and then returned, " If you don't want to communicate, you can't answer, I'm just curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secrecy of magical knowledge, he still pays more attention, will not rush to spy on others Confidential. This is a serious problem that has caused many veterans' vendettas many times, but his dynamic face is full of words such as "Tell me," "Tell me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and said: "Nothing, I am also stumped by some problems. I need someone to communicate with me, give me inspiration, um. I am from From the perspective of infinite division and recombination..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no secret ideas, and he talks eloquently. Although Fernando mostly does not understand, The mathematical foundation is based on high IQ. I can barely follow, and I ask questions from time to time. And this makes Douglas more interested and more in-depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this symbol mean?" Fernando has come to Douglas, pointing to a symbol on the scratch paper in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas eyes brighten: "My own defined symbol, indicating infinity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the two completely fell into the discussion of mathematical issues and forgot the existence of Roland outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that few people have devoted themselves to Douglas to share his favorite and favorite questions, so he is very excited now, without the peace and elegance of the past, no Such as the spring breeze, only the excitement and joy of the eyebrows, only the endless words, like the most embarrassing old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" Roland was waiting outside for a long time, but he did not find any signs of fighting, and the secret eye could detect Fernando’s alive. So, I was brave and walked in with full of doubts. I saw that I was learning the scene in my magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s face is very rosy now: “Communication problems.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Douglas calmed the excitement of the heated discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando silently said: "Tonight's raid here, killing a high-ranking vigil and traitor, but everything is safe, Don't take risks, and evacuate immediately if there is an abnormal situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at him with surprise. When we discussed it, it was not said that, there is no second sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need detailed information, need strength comparison, distribution of magical arrays, etc. Only then can I decide not to agree." Douglas is very cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly analyzed the situation in the city and told the inferences and opinions of himself and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded lightly: "According to the information you gave, success may not be small, because the night watchers would never have thought that we would be bold enough to directly attack them, but It is also very dangerous. As long as there is a slight delay, the church reacts and opens up the divine array and the transmission array. We are in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church was trying to defeat the magic The parliament is a step by step. The churches in such big cities must have a transmission line to the capitals of all countries. The "heart of time" and "sword of truth", the cardinal and other legendary powers can come within a few minutes, if they are by the city. The divine array is disturbed and the danger will be magnified infinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland will take magical items to interfere with the church, but at most it can get two or three seconds, we must seize the opportunity to escape." Fernando said preliminary The plan for discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, even if I meet the Golden Knight, I am sure to get out of the battle quickly, unless his immunization time stops." Douglas revealed that he would be the hardest in the Nine Rings spell. One of the few to learn, "Time to stop." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will raided the referee with you." Fernando's repressed anger leaked a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the detailed plan and the alternate escape method were worked out, Roland quietly asked Fernando: "Why should you emphasize safety as a priority and not take risks?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s expression is very serious: “Because I think Douglas’s value is many times higher than the entire referee, the whole city. Even higher than our entire union, of course. Except me. Outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland once again stared blankly at his friends. He always liked to attack others, rarely praising others, but actually gave Douglas such a high rating. ! Even if the final supplement reveals his nature, is it too ridiculous? Is the sun rising from the west today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened before I didn’t come in? Is Fernando controlled by illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you see it?" Roland controlled his inner surprise and asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is angry and said: "Where can you see it! Here, here. Here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He pointed to the draft paper on the floor and then whispered Douglas's research to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he succeeds, will the difficulty of becoming a high-level magician be reduced?" Roland said excitedly, he always admired his friends and said to him. The judgment is more trusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows, there are still many problems, maybe he hasn't finished when he went to see the goddess of magic." Fernando couldn't help but damage Douglas. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening is coming. As the sun sets, the sky is red and the gates are about to close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a hill nearby, Fernando stood in a temporary array of auxiliary magic and prepared for spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He really improved that magic?" Douglas asked Roland with some curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolando proudly said: "Well, there is no one inside the entire union and other organizations I am familiar with. This one can manipulate this magic so perfectly, As a real change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
