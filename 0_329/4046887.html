At the same time, in the white maple palace of Antilles, once the "Sun King" Tanos, now the Imperial Emperor Doffer II also stood up from the throne and flashed to the "display screen". His eyes were deep and dignified but he was delighted. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he seems to have grasped the key to returning to the level of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this experiment does not have double seams, there is no such thing as a "recording alarm", but a brand new design, which is achieved through this design. The purpose of recording and erasing, but Douglas and Lucien have already demonstrated the equivalent of the two experiments in principle. According to Lucien, this experiment now excludes many unnecessary "interferences". It can make the weak "effect" not be destroyed, otherwise the experiment does not have to wait until Douglas becomes a god to be able to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, but all the intelligent life of a little insight has a kind of trembling shock, is it that the observation of "we" causes the wave name to disappear and the particle name to appear? key? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the world still objective and real? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lucien? Is the observer effect proposed by Evans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the lab bench, Douglas’s raised hands had a noticeable tremor, and it’s obviously unacceptable for this result, but it’s all designed according to his vision. It was done by Him personally, without any omissions or other influences in the middle, and the results were true and credible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien first proposed this thought experiment to "prove" the "observer effect"! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this does not rule out other reasons than the "observer effect", it also allows all arcans to face up to the "observer effect" Maybe, at least until you find another theoretical explanation, you can no longer ignore the "observer effect"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas stabilized the hands that seemed to be diffused, repeating the experiment again, and the transformed interference fringes remained clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, twice, three times, after five full times, Douglas looked up, solemn and slightly low: "The repeatable surname shows that the experimental results are no problem. After today, the Arcanist can apply for these devices and repeat the experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live room, dead silence, Samantha, Louise and some of the highest The members of the jury were still in a state of sorrow and resistance that they could not believe. Most of the legendary magicians such as Brooke, Fernando, Hathaway, Helen, Oliver and Vicente showed a contemplative expression. After being shocked and attacked, they chose. Thinking about the "observer effect" can not find other reasons to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Annick shook his head, ignoring the glass slag under his feet, squatting back and forth, his mouth silently, seemingly looking for other reasons. And Sprint is standing there, not knowing what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Observer effect... Is there really an observer effect?" Heidi whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment was designed to highlight the existence of the observer effect, and the results are clear and unobtrusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general school, aristocratic school, Ali looked at the students next to him, as if they were asking them, and they seemed to ask themselves: "This is impossible." If the 'we' perception is the cause of everything, will the whole world be objective and real? This is totally inconsistent with the concept of arcane..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The comparison of the experiments before and after, a clear conclusion is clearly revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least it is caused by our own observations, not the gods, and the fate is in our own hands." The squad leader Charlotte answered subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students next to "This...this..." are stunned, only to know that the previous arcanes have been subverted, what is right? of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the live screen, Douglas put away a solemn expression, and the tone and ambiguity contained a little solemnity: "The quantum erasure experiment is completed, then we carry out the second It is also the last experiment, Evans delays the selection experiment, we still have to make a deformation of the traditional electronic double-slit interference experiment to better highlight the results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“The previous electronic double-slit interference experiment let us know that if we choose the fluctuating surname and design the experiment, then the diffraction stripe will be presented to us, and if we want to see the particle surname, we add a record alarm. There will be a pure particle spot superposition on the screen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time our choices and corresponding arrangements led to different results."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas used the words very cautiously, still not using the "observer effect", but adding "corresponding arrangement" in addition to "choice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcane Masters who watched the live broadcast nodded no matter what theory, the Speaker of the Speaker just described is an objective experimental fact, without any problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas continues: "If we delay this choice? In the above experiment, when the fluctuating surname is presented, the electron apparently passes through two gaps at the same time. After two paths, then self-interference, and when the particle surname is presented, it must pass through one of the gaps, after a path, then we have actually selected the path in the electronic, but have not yet reached the display before making their own Choice, what will happen? Will you observe that electrons come from two or a path?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the double-slit interference experiment has been deformed, Douglas does not Use double seams instead of paths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what choice is made, the path of the electronic pass is determined before the selection, and will not change any more..." Ali and other ordinary people erased the experiment from the previous The recovery is the fastest, and I start to use my shallow arcane knowledge to judge what might happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick shook his head and asked himself not to think about other explanations of the "erasing experiment", but to look at the experiment with his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment by the teacher is also related to the "observer effect", but Annick does not think that there will be results that are beneficial to the "observer" hypothesis just now. After all, is the electron going two or a journey? Before the choice is made, it has already been determined that it is always impossible to "observe" and cause the past things to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Pope" of the Holy City of Lans, Wicken, converges on the previous joy, watching Douglas lay the experiment with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly does this experiment want to prove? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t think there’s anything unexpected, it’s shocking, it’s just shocking, this experiment looks more like Refuting a bold hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II re-sitting on the throne of the White Maple Leaf Palace, quietly watching the experimental picture, I do not know why there is a bad premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the highest-rated jury in the live room and Samantha, Louise and others are also slightly confused, difficult road to Sean? Evans wants to prove that the current observations can affect what has happened in the past? This is an exaggerated idea than time back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past has been determined, how can it change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas initiated the experiment, the detector signaled, and the electrons came through a path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment is repeated over and over again, once again demonstrating that the electrons have come through a single path after the previous steps. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, when the electronics completed the previous steps and did not reach the detector position, Douglas quickly joined the new experimental setup, indicating that we wanted to select the "fluctuated surname ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the detector in the other direction sounds at the same time as the current detector, and the sound of the drip is endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas turned pale because he knew very well what it meant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that when we made the choice, we have determined that only one path of electrons comes from two directions, and what happened in the past has changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our "observation" has changed the electronic "past experience"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
