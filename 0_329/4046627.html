			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, there is a sense of sight... Lucien heard the Douglas proposal and almost couldn’t control his expression and blurted out: "Lord of the Speaker, and Pure mathematical field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I forgot, mathematics is the brightest jewel in the crown of arcane and magic, how can it be less? Now a total of ten Two fields of awards." Douglas took his forehead and smiled humorously. "Lucene, your proposal is a little late, or else the discovery of neutrons, the general theory of relativity is enough for you to take Evans. The Element Prize and the Evans Star Award."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien waved his hand and did not care: "I have enough magic items and some use No, so the prize is not important. If it is a reputation, there is the Lucien Evans Prize. I think I will be remembered with every winner."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Medal "Superconductor" and the Ice and Snow Medal "Quantum" have been awarded, There are a lot of badges on the chest, these two are not special and can make up for the magic effect of their own defects, in order to prevent interference with the same type of badge, so not worn, but placed in the storage bag, in case of need . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you can get so free and easy to get a soft arcane master." Oliver smiled, regardless of his heart or not, within the highest jury He and Douglas, Atlante, Klaus, Erica, Manuel are a few members who are good at talking. People are like bathing in the spring breeze. Others who look normal are each have a certain social shortness. Board, such as the No. 2 character Brooke is full of gentlemanly manners, broad-minded, but the name is relatively lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the seemingly abnormal Fernando, Vicente, Hathaway, Helen, Davy and others, not to mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Lucien, Oliver turned to look at Douglas: "His Speaker, I think the awards by faction are a bit out of line with the current situation, and it is obvious Seeing that the new alchemy research will definitely involve electromagnetic content, and the general theory of relativity itself contains the astrology, force field, light and dark and changing factions. Are we integrating the Evans Prize into a relatively large number? Awards, don't know when to give it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas agreed to nod. "I’m right, I read and reviewed Lucien during this time. In the general theory of relativity, the esoteric content of multiple factions is clearly felt, and its predecessor is 'the electrodynamics of moving objects', which belongs to the electromagnetic faction. In fact, according to my thoughts, everything belongs to the arcane system. An Evans Arcane Award is almost the same, but it is obviously not authoritative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not authoritative? Whether it is element, electromagnetic, light dark, star Force field, alchemy, and heat are all studying the laws of the world. The mystery of matter and energy is called the Evans Arcane Prize. There is no problem in illusion, change, summoning, and death. The specific thing is called the Evans Magic Award." Brooke did not object because of the mustard, very recognized authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "Why must we divide according to factions? Deeply reveal the results of the world's mysteries and basic laws, take Evans Arcane The awards are relatively more practical and specific, as well as the magic prizes for studying the complex application rules based on the basic laws, plus the more abstract and more basic mathematical awards, a total of three awards."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest that the study of the human body and the soul in the Necromancer system, the study of psychology within the illusion system alone, be combined into an award, because they belong to the category of medical care, whether it is The body, or the spirit, can be treated from it. This helps us to shape the new image of the magician and compete with the healing effect of the magic, so we should express the encouragement of the parliament through similar awards." Atlante proposed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s right hand to pick up his chin, Evans Medical Award? Don't ever come up with something more strange. If there is a peace prize, I will propose to the teacher and Hathaway, who used the "eternal blaze" and human bombs to maintain the peace of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, arcane award, magic prize, mathematics award, medical award, four awards correspond to the four basic forces." Douglas hammered, other people naturally did not Opposing, I can't argue with him because of this problem. "Well, the meeting will end here, and the assigned tasks will be completed or given to the committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice just When he fell, he disappeared, and Lu Xien, who had not yet got up in the sitting position, was quite surprised. The Speaker of the Speaker is running too fast, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has also recently tried to understand general relativity, and the discovery of neutrons has diverted his attention and discovered many problems of the new alchemy, which is busy studying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the members of the other top judges did not leave without delay, confirming Oliver’s words—everyone’s time is precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The four basic forces, I suspect that the power of binding protons and neutrons should belong to one of the two fundamental forces that have not yet been confirmed." Hathaway's expression is indifferent. The eyes are thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded: "I think so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Lucien discovered that Hathaway had crossed her own and walked to the door, not waiting for her answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out she was talking to herself..." Lucien touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Oliver came over: "Would you like me to take you to the committee?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, Mr. Oliver, the soup is there." Lucien smiled and refused, knowing that he was looking for an excuse to go to the panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver spread his hand: "It seems that nothing can help, Lucian, I heard that you also set up an Evan when you were in Aalto." Music Awards? Are you interested in joining us to get an art award?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Gold? Lucien was already drinking sky blue, almost squirting out, and finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Oliver, I sponsored a third of the property, and there is really no extra capacity." Lucien refused Oliver’s invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver smiled and said: "It seems that I can only prepare myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thinks Lucien, a big musician, is qualified to set up with himself, and there is no such thing as a strong demand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Oliver left, Klaus, who had been sitting opposite, got up and said humorously: "I used to get up early, and I used to the last few to leave, Evans, You just said that the Lucien Evans Prize requires more stringent standards. Is it necessary to explode the theory and findings of others' heads to qualify?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crow Mr. Si, you are really joking.” Lucien laughed twice and his reputation was too loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Klaus walked out of the door, Lucien deliberately coughed twice, leaving only himself and the "ice witch" Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen is concentrating on learning the content of Evans geometry, the feather pen is flying fast, and he has never heard Lucy’s cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, Lucien continues to cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen still didn’t respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Helen..." Lucian simply shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen just raised his head a little blankly: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she saw Looking around, I asked in a hurry: "Is the meeting over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s over." Lucien is quite ashamed, compared with her, concentrates on herself. The degree is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen nodded, no surprise, seems to have gotten used to this situation, continue to bury his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Helen..." Lucien reluctantly shouted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Light Blue is close to the colorless eyes and looks at Lucien, wondering: "What? Why don't you leave?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not saying to take me to pick the legendary magic when the meeting is over?" Lucian tried to keep a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." Helen didn't delay and swear, with Lucien going to a hidden library on the 35th floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the standard, you can pick a magic directly." In this kind of thing, Helen has always used words to be simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien came up with an advanced ritual map of the legendary career of "Atomic Control" and two basic legendary magical roads: "What if I hand over them?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two basic magics are changed one by one, the legendary career is changed two, you can pick five in total." Seeing these two things, Helen's attention Only then, but because of the regulations, she can only see the introduction of the atomic control and the two legendary magic, as well as the overall structure, whether it has a unique sense of the legendary field, in order to deepen the study, must be exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stepped into this small library, where the bookshelves were placed with legendary magic or wonderful rituals. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to parliamentary statistics, the legendary magic that has appeared so far is between 156 and 165, and some belong to racially-specific spells, parliament Not yet acquired, such as the "real dream" of the vampire family, "destruction screaming", etc., some of the legendary magician's card spells, there is no parliament, such as Hathaway's "elemental decomposition", Lucien's "time and space scepter" "Douglas's "storm enchantment" and so on, so there are a total of 87 legendary magic to choose from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you have a legendary magic that has nothing to do with your legendary career, you can’t learn it. If it’s at the point of conflict, it’s impossible to learn unless Can achieve the level of arcane fantasy of the unified factions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a few years, Lucien can only build three legendary magic in the soul, so it must be carefully selected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My atomic fission is a range type, including high temperature, energy storm, curse and other aspects of the attack, so there is no need to first select the range of killing legendary magic, The "time and space scepter" I intend to construct can now provide a certain area of ​​acceleration and slowdown effect, can create a space barrier, break the space shackles, is the magic of escape, defense and control, this aspect can also not pick... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has only a preliminary understanding of this horror magic from general relativity, and believes that every time he raises the first order, its effect will gradually increase and Significantly improved, maybe when it comes to the legendary third-order or peak, there is a certain range of ability to escape time and space, worthy of the name "time and space scepter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magic of enchantment and enchantment, the teacher has promised to teach me 'storm enchantment', not the preferred type, the seven magics on the legendary items, I can reverse the analysis, and I don't have to choose." Lucien looked at the legendary magic name and effect on the shelf and carefully considered it. "What I lack most is a single attacking legendary magic..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Lucien quickly had three alternatives: "The Wrath of the Snow Goddess", "The Revenge Gaze", and "Evaporation". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the icy-like magic of the deep ray and the goddess of ice and snow, Lucien prefers the latter two to enrich the diverse names of the spells. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge gaze" seems to be a high-energy laser ray that creates horror. The melting and penetrating surnames are excellent, and "human evaporation" is to directly damage the target. Without a defense, you can let a legendary magician evaporate from the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge gaze is good for most defensive layers, and it's very fast, it's hard to avoid..." It took almost no time, Lucy Well, there is a decision, it will be the third legendary magic built by myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Lucien also selected four legendary magics that will be learned in the future, namely, "spiritual blasting" and prophetic legendary magic that affect thinking ability. The mirror of destiny, the trigger of the surname of the legendary magic "reunion" and the peak of magic defense "steep turn". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne wanted to choose "luxury big crack", but he has "elemental order", and will be converted into "elemental decomposition, you can also learn nine ring magic." "Large lysis", some repetitions, is not the most necessary choice - although "big lysis" is not as effective as "luxury cleavage", "elemental decomposition" can not deal with energy, space-type barriers, but they can be combined Reluctantly cope with various situations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
