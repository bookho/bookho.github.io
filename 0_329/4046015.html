			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling countless ways to make a fortune in the novel, Lucien sadly discovered that he knew too little about the world and didn’t know that these methods had No use, and no matter what you do, the first bucket of gold is especially important, and you only have seven copper fairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the sun at nine o'clock is in the market area, Lucien has carried a bag of heavy goods and headed for the gate area. After all, a lot At the time, survival is ranked first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat can’t stop falling from his face, he’s got into his neck, soaked in linen clothes, not the strong sun shining on Lucien’s body, he’s heavy. The more painful, at the same time, the hard-working Lucian also has to endure the chatter of the fat man Gucci next to him:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, who has found such a child, you go Keep it steady, don't break my goods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the handkerchief and rubbing the Gucci out of the sweat that slammed up and down, Lucien abdomen : "All you are, please only ask one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this way, Lucien’s reward is mentioned from the three copper fairs. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get to the Shing Mun area, and Lu Xien put the goods safely on the freight wagon waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Gucci reluctantly took out the purse and took out four copper fairs and handed them to Lucien: "Your reward, young man, did not expect your strength." It’s not too small. If there is any cargo to be transported in the future, I will go directly to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of Lucien is actually not comparable to the young people of the same age who have been trained. Can win at a cheap price, one can be used as two, the Gucci naturally wants to be so praised, completely forget how he cursed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just got the copper fair, Lucian saw the two men wearing a linen jacket, very fierce look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the men of Aaron's boss, you can call me Andre." The brown-haired man who spoke showed his identity and had a shallow face. Shallow scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands what they are doing, and they are prepared for it, and they don’t plan to read (read-force) specialties. This is called the man of Andre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another burly man glanced at Lucien: "Two copper fair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Don't you say that you only give one?" Lucien is now a poor man. Even if he knows that he is currently unable to fight against the gangsters, he can't help but argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s not your own, Gucci will hire two people, and everyone will give us a copper ferry. This loss, of course, cannot be borne by us. "Andre laughed like a legitimate businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a copper fair, and it’s not related to Lucien’s survival and bottom line. Therefore, Lucien was later hunted by a gang and a copper fair. In the meantime, just hesitating for a second, he endured it and took out a copper ferry and handed it to the man who walked around Andre, like a man who showed his strong body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, kid, you understand the truth, there used to be some hairy guys who like to challenge us, but you also saw it, we are still here. And some of them have sunk to the bottom of the Belém River. Well, Mag, there are people coming there." Andre intimidated a few words as usual, and with Mag, turned and walked to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the backs of the two of them, and they felt a little wrong in their hearts. Although they knew that they would be exploited by the gangs at the beginning, when they actually met, Still can't help but change the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After swearing that he was not enthusiastic enough, Lucien understood that he had to get rid of this situation, either with strong personal strength or a certain social status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in this world, a strong personal strength often means a high social status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if there is any potion in the magic notes that grows strength and physique?" Lucien couldn't help but think about it, even if he knew it well. It is a dangerous sign, a sign that can't stand the temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Musicians Association near the Shengli Hall in the administrative district is famous for its unique architectural style in Aalto. Therefore, Lucien, who was pushing the rented four-wheeled cart, just asked for a road and found the name "Bounce Flame." "building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of vertical lines, small spires, flying buttresses, stained glass, and window slabs shaped like flames, giving the entire five-story light-colored building an asymmetrical The exaggerated beauty is light and complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien coming over, a wretched, middle-aged man with a goatee walked down the steps: "How come so?" Late? Look at the clock of the Golden Cathedral, it’s already a little faster!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the entrusted mission, Lucien was already under the arrangement of the dwarfs. I have seen this middle-aged man once and know that he is George. There are some relationships within the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"George, there are still ten minutes." Lucien pointed out that the aristocratic area in the distance stood tall, majestic and heavy, and seemed to control the entire city. The golden cathedral, the hour hand above, and the big one, point to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George complained: "The servants invited by the association have been cleaned up in advance, and you will come in and hand over to me, or else the garbage heap in the mountains will be behind the association. The mood of the musicians who came to work, it was troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was very curious about the path of Uncle Joel’s dream musicians, so there was no George argued, set the cart aside, let the guards watch, and stepped up the stairs and walked toward the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pushing the door inlaid with pieces of stained glass, Lucien saw a bright, grand, wide hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor is covered with a soft thick carpet, there is no footsteps on it, and there are very few people coming and going. The whole hall looks quiet and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under George's leadership, Lucian walked to the front of the hall in front of a half-high wooden platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind the wooden platform, a beautiful girl with a brown hair, a sweet smile, and a crisp voice: "Uncle George, are you looking for someone?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that she handed out a squeaky purse to George. According to Lucien, there were at least forty Tongfei, and I couldn’t help it. With a snoring, I was able to earn eight copper fairs in addition to the money for renting carts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George took the purse and revealed two rows of yellow and yellow teeth, laughing and smashing his eyes into a line: "Elena, you are looking for someone to lead the way to Sean." Behind the garden, don't look at his young age, he is not strong, but his strength is very big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he went to Lucien Road "Your money, I will put it in Andre, Shing Mun District. You can go and get it when you come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ordered Nod, I don’t worry that George will take the money. The Aaron gangs are embarrassed to collect money, but they are very reputable in this respect. According to Yan, there have been people who tried to get rid of the employment expenses. Doubled the reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena is about to greet the servant in the hall to lead the way to Sean to carry the rubbish in the back garden, and suddenly saw a middle-aged man in a red wide coat left. Come in, get up and get up, and say a little: "Good afternoon, Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man is dressed simple and elegant, with a touch of erhu Black curls, sea-blue eyes reveal a melancholy color: "Good afternoon, Elena, give me a "music review"." The sound is mellow and heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Elena taking out a brand new newspaper from the cabinet under the wooden table, Lucien couldn’t help but be surprised: "Aalto has developed Out of the newspaper? And it’s still a special type.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the situation in the slums, Lucien’s heart sighed: “The world’s polarization seems to be serious However, there are still not many people who know the text, how much does the newspaper have to sell to get the cost back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor first puts the Music Review in hand On the top, I turned over at random, then gave Elena ten copper fairs, nodded to Lucien and George politely, and turned the newspaper and walked to the stairs next to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
