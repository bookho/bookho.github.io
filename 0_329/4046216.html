			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's roaring voice echoed like a thunder in the hall, shaking the arcanes' ears. This is confused with the shock that has just witnessed the confirmation of the periodic table of elements. There is a complex feeling of vibrancy, expectation and fear, even Gaston, Avery, Locklint, Lydia and Lavin. The members of the audit committee, who are not far from each other, are unable to maintain the usual calm, and are slightly excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confirmation of the periodic table indicates that the new elements found in the magic field of the element are no longer scattered and blind, and the cat that has been described as blinded has hit a Only the dead mouse, it will be guided by theory, there are rules to follow, and there are things to move forward! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the world, trying to sum up the law from the phenomenon, and then deducing other phenomena by these laws", the elemental magic field is no more in line with the research results. Spiritual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this mood, they didn’t react to Lavin’s problems for a while, but there was an excited and uneasy male surname in the corner of the hall. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Evans? Mr. X..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien Mr. Evans? Mr. X is here!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeating the discourse, the voice became extremely large and seemed to be difficult to control, as if afraid that others could not hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Ravendy and most of the arcane masters did not expect such an answer, Lucien? Evans? X is actually in the venue? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon, Larry reacted the fastest time, the Lutheran who met the same name with K before? Evans is Mr. X! His level of arcane is only one level, which fits well with the signature below the title of the paper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great enough discovery to be summed up by a first-class arcian, a magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the half-height metal table, Leandre next to Lavindi stunned in front of him, and his face became like a dry orange peel for ten days of water. There are countless thoughts mixed up in my mind, and I can’t find a line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone’s eyes are on the lookout, and Razer is raising his hand in the corner. He wears his usual black double-breasted long dress and looks abnormal. Excited, after receiving the letter from Lucien, he took the opportunity to arrange the venue and turned over the temporarily printed "Elements" journal, focusing on the paper of the Periodic Table of the Year, which was very impressive. deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when the experiment of Lavin’s first scene was carried out, every data or every surname was measured like a wave of waves hitting his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guess based on the law of the elemental cycle is so precise that it is more worthy of the prophecy than the fuzzy prophecy of the star system, as if he has seen it with his own eyes. That new element! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magical thing that even the magicians are incredible. Lazar is naturally dizzy and his head is swollen. It wasn't until Raven's growl came to his ears that he came back to God: this magical paper with horrific value is his friend Lucien? Written by Evans! The X letter behind his name, he is the first to know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great joy and glory hit Lazar, and although he was worried that he would be ravaged by Raven’s grumpy Master, he would still Start, shouted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadside beside him, after the atomic quantity of the new element was measured, he closed his eyes and his adventure finally succeeded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy, invigoration, happiness, fear and other emotions continue to ferment in the heart of Lucien, if this new element is a strange isotope, then this paper I don't know when I will wait until I get the attention, and once the Arcane Masters are blindly arrogant and have no corresponding strength label, the next paper will be subject to inexplicable incognito discrimination. In addition to the protection of the will of the element by the Holm crown ring, there is no other way in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien’s grasp of this is far greater than the hunch of failure, because the analysis of this family of different worlds can roughly judge even if there are isotopes. Being able to exist steadily does not affect its arrangement in the periodic table of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easier to say other phenomena according to the law. How many people can adhere to the rules they have summarized before the phenomenon is confirmed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi, Timothy and other arcaneists saw an inspiring young man standing beside the excited and excited Lazar Wearing a black bow tie and wearing a double-breasted long dress of the same color, both formal and handsome, the black pupil is dark and deep...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Lucien? Evans? The X?" object was too young, and Lavin asked with a slight surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is also quiet. Except for the magicians prepared by Gaston and Larry, other arcane masters can hardly imagine the youngness of Lucien. They also thought that a low-level arcane master who was a long-term research element surname discovered the cyclical law by chance, but it seems that this is not the case. This is a real young man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien returned to God when he was roaring in Raven, controlling his excitement and keeping his smile: "Yes, Lord Lavendi." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some of the legends of the Nine-ring Magician who do not conform to the tradition of the Magic Council. Lavin is the vice president of the will of the element. The problem is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s eyes narrowed, slightly inciting a magic, reading the record of the Lucien Arcane Badge directly, then nodding: "Evans, come up, I think you will come to your speech at the end of today's meeting. It has great significance, and I believe that every arcian who is present can understand that I don't need to say anything more. This The 'Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference' will be loaded into the history of magic for you and your research!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Mr. Ravendi." Plus Sir stood up. In the eyes of everyone's doubts, he smiled. "The significance of the periodic table is still clear. I am too negligent to review this paper, so I want to share with Mr. Avery. File an application with the committee to request a reassessment of the paper, giving Evans the glory, praise, points, and arcane points he deserves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aufrey Get up and nod, indicating that you agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the assessed person is not satisfied with the results of the review of his thesis, he can complain to the Arcane Review Committee, as long as two of the members agree to apply for the parallel name, Can re-evaluate the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon and Avery two old foxes witnessed the tremendous shock brought by the periodic table of the elements, and decided to apply for each other after discussing each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand they are taking mistakes for their own students, on the other hand they also have opponents, they are not convinced that they have an authoritative reputation in the field, always want Drive them out of the enemies of the Arcane Review Board. These enemies will certainly not miss an article in the "level of the elemental crown" that only gives an arcane point, an arcane point "absurd" assessment of the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you can’t pass it, you can’t press it, it’s better to ask for a reassessment, and it’s more just and modest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a deep breath and took a step, passing through the aisle between the orthodox seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who started first, an orthographer got up from the seat and greeted him as a welcome crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I regret that I didn't find the value of this paper in the first place." Larry firmly held his left chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Timothy pushed the glasses: "Evans, if you put those kinds of atomic quantities that have not been experimentally corrected to the last one of the paper, maybe I I went to see you that night. But no matter what, this is a lesson I should remember. Oh, in the future, your essay will definitely become a beautiful talk in the magic world, and I and Larry are the beautiful images in your beauty. The clown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is humorous and straightforward, similar to his style of studying explosive magic, but contrary to his elegant and gentle appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least two of my papers have passed the review." Lucien had no bad impression on both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, when he passed by Ulysses, he squeezed his nose and bitterly said: "No matter what other people have questions, I totally believe in Evans's periodic table of elements. In fact, I have been close to this result, but I gave up the idea because I could not explain the atomic weight of those elements. Bold assumptions, careful verification is more difficult than I have always thought. , authority and experience have bound me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
