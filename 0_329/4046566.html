			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you watched Roque leave, Lucine smiled and smiled, not optimistic about his thoughts, and then turned his attention back to "Arcane" and read all the time. At the end of the day, I saw the discussion of the surname paper submitted by Annick and Sprint - a discussion about the difference between the actual effect and the ideal effect of the cyclotron. They vaguely believe that the energy is converted into electricity, but the formula cannot be extracted. It also deducts specific data to adjust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope more people will start thinking about this issue." Lucian closed the journal and concentrated on the eight-ring magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July 3, morning, the heat wave is rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovies don’t know that this is the first time in the recent period to come to the Allinge Tower, he only knows if he can’t find it. Mission, get enough compensation to pay the rent, then it is difficult to survive in all the expensive places of Aringe, you must stay away from this "the center of arcane and magic", go somewhere else to find opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I blame myself, I am afraid of hardships at school, I have not worked hard enough, I have not been an elite apprentice, and I cannot be recommended to a good position." Lowe has no complaints. Resentment, but reviewing itself, in the final analysis, is the result of not working hard at the beginning. If you can become an elite apprentice in school, you can be recommended to the Magician Management Department, Apprentice Assessment Department, Mission Area, etc. Departments, or organizations, journals, and alchemy companies in Aringe, are not only exposed to numerous formal magicians, but also have a generous salary to survive in Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell touched his arms, and there was a recommendation letter from the school for the local magic organization in the county of Perth, Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in other remote counties, even the magic apprentices of the Solar Islands Division, it is recommended to go to Pephos County. The top three places in the most prosperous area of ​​the Kingdom of Mum are very enviable, but for Lovi, who suddenly wakes up when he graduates, as long as it is not Aringe, it makes no sense, because it means far from the "Arcane and The center of magic research, the students who will be left here gradually widen their distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the sample survey and statistics of Lace Weekly, which appeared only a few years ago, after leaving the magic school, stay at Aringe at least three In the apprenticeship of the year, about one in ten people can become a formal magician, not to mention the horror ratio of the three-to-one elite apprentices who are recommended to a good position, far higher than the 20th of the branches outside the Rantat. Than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Solar Islands Division and the remote county magic organization reached an astonishing thirty-one, which is prohibitive, unless there is no way, no one I don't want to go - after the "world real" channel, it is said that it has changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lovi resolutely removed his fingers from his chest and could not fall behind other people from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the feeling of burning in the stomach bag made Lovevi smile. In order to save money, I have not had breakfast for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own family is not rich, and can’t find anything that is suitable for them and is relatively rewarding. Dreams can only succumb to reality, unless they are willing to pick up those It seems to be a dangerous task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is life, or a dream? It’s hard to decide." Lovi teased himself, swallowing a sip and relieving hunger, and it became reasonable to start looking old. Black apprentice robe, walking towards the mission area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for a silver-gray metal counter that was temporarily unoccupied, Lovi slightly lifted his head and carefully looked at the tasks shown on the dark green magic water curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Secret Secret Mining Mission in the Southern Desert of the Gusta Empire: Fix an Arcane Point or Quintal's reward every day, and finally receive additional compensation based on the quality and quantity of the ore. Please refer to the details for specific calculation methods. Strength requirements: no limit. Quantity: no limit. Danger degree: high, need to face monsters in the desert, but also guard against attacks by church vigils and clergymen. At the same time, ore contains Invisible curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich reward flashed Lowell’s eyes, but the final description made him stop, without the strength of a formal magician, don’t even think about it. The task is relatively stable, and at least seven or eight are killed in ten apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Wei has some heartbeats. Although he has no remuneration to buy materials and borrow books, it is possible to avoid the high cost of living in Allinge, and it is still an assistant to an alchemist. Maybe he can learn. To a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, I am a magician who prefers to cast spells instead of refining items. The three-year delay will only be farther away from others. It is better to go to Pephos. County, master the latest research direction through magic radio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell shook his head and continued to look at the task, but they were not too dangerous, or the reward was too low or The cycle is too long to cope with the embarrassing situation at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour of reading the new task, Lowe became very frustrated. Do you really want to leave Allinge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician wearing a different style of clothing is taking a smile and leaving after the task, but in the eyes of Lovi, they are like another picture of the world. The surroundings are full of color and light, while the one around them is gray and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to give up, Lovi looked up again, looking for a task with a low-paying short period to cope with the day, and then wait until tomorrow to see if there is a new post. Appropriate, suddenly, the dark green water curtain jumped a bit and a new message jumped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apprentice Recruitment Mission: The Atomic Research Institute on the 18th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower urgently needs ten apprentice-level assistants. Duration: three years. Strength requirements: At least a high-level magic apprentice. Remuneration: 10 Arcane points per month, free arcane and magic basic books, experimental devices without additional payment. Deadline: July 10th."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apprentice-level assistant?" Lowe recounted a bit stunned, and the rewards behind him were unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his gaze jerked, and the words that appeared dark red under the dark green leaped into the eye:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Research Institute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Research Institute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Loveton felt that there was a fire burning from his heart into his head, hot, and I couldn’t figure out anything, the Institute of Atomic Research, the "new alchemy" proponent Lucien? Mr. Evans' Atomic Research Institute, that is the holy place in the minds of every magician who is interested in the path of elements and material. Every month, there are magical places where new research results appear, representing the most advanced level in the current atomic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place recruits apprentice-level assistants? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you waiting for! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell feels that the dream is in front of him. It is so dazzling, his nose is squirting, and he quickly picks up the task and picks it up from the responsible person. After a transfer of the form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CV?" Lovi has never heard of such a thing since he was a child, and he has some stunned moments. Fortunately, the above clauses are very clear, he According to their own situation, they can be completed one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the 'CV' passes the review, there will be a first round of written test in two days, which is an assessment of the basics of arcane and magic in the elemental field." Retelling the details of the task, she has not heard of the so-called resume and written test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days, can I still stay in Aringe for two days? Is it a transition to a variety of low-paying short-cycle tasks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell is a bit stunned, but his heart is rushing up and looking at his apprentice robe: "You can't do the task, you must concentrate on reviewing the arcane." And the basis of magic... Selling this robe to the redemption area should last for seven days!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the decision, Lowell’s eyes became brighter, Stepping vigorously out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible personnel watched him leave, shook his head, his face also appeared a fanatical expression, and quickly got a resume to fill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell just took a few steps and suddenly heard someone exclaimed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Atomic Research Institute recruits apprentice assistants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
