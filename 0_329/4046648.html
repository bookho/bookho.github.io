			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the committee, Lucien happened to meet Douglas student Norman, one of the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of Evans, you are the truth of the element..." Norman salutes in accordance with the rules of the Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "You don't have to be so troublesome, you have to delay time. I used to use tribute words only when I first met you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of Evans, do you have something to tell the committee?" Norman asked. "In fact, you don't have to bother with this. You can use the tower communication tool to contact the members on duty. Or let us go to your study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien pointed to the conference room: "Some things are more clearly stated in person."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Holt School of Magic about it, Lucien looked at Norman and said: "What is unclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, this is a very good idea, a teaching model that I have never seen before. I also graduated from the Magic School. If I were able to choose courses and teachers independently, I would save at least one year. The time." Norman smiled and praised this new model, he can be seen by Douglas, indicating that the original talent is very amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien secretly thought that if someone else proposed this kind of independent teaching mode, it would probably be considered to undermine the school atmosphere and undermine the traditional teacher-student relationship. It was like the dilemma that I met when I was at Douglas Magic School, but now Norman gives a very high praise based on the impression with almost no analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apprentices are not very old, and their choice will only indulge themselves. Different ages require different ways. It is definitely not a good idea to indulge." Lucien got up and said, "The college is limited to two years. You can graduate in advance, or you can apply for a one-year delay. You can come up with specific things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well, I will organize the committee discussion as soon as possible." Norman has recorded Lucien's story in the magic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was leaving, a middle-level arcian of a panel came in: "Mr. Norman, the sorcerer of the Ice Lady The secret recording stone allowed the committee to organize the discussion of the surname article."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recording stone?" Norman looked at Lucien strangely, and the highest commenting group Do you want to tell other things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding the material in Gaston to complete the magic phonograph, many arcans have developed similar products, and the recording stone is one of them, than the previous one. Simplification is much easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s some discussion before the meeting." Lucian stopped the move and was ready to observe Norman, although he could determine this based on logic and prophetic spells. The discussion will not cause the magician to cognize the world, but it is still necessary to hear the response from the Norman, the high-level arcane master, to judge the acceptance of the people and adjust the release of the next paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman saw Lucien sit down again, thinking that he had to explain the contents of the recording stone, so he signaled the middle-level arcane master to go out first. He opened the soundproofing and confidentiality of the conference room, and then inspired the recording stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has been no experiment to prove the electronic fluctuating surname..." The clear and cold voice of Hathaway came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman’s heart was suddenly overwhelmed. It should be a discussion of Dieppe’s paper and his evaluation by His Excellency Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the continuation of the debate, Norman gradually became more and more focused, and there are several views of yours that represent his own views, such as micro Particles are waves, so why is the human body composed of microscopic particles not a wave? For example, Hathaway's special vibration of particles shows an explanation of the fluctuating surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Oliver asked about Lucien’s point of view, Norman looked curiously at Lucien sitting in the conference room chair, and it’s hard to understand why. I will ask 'what is the wave', 'what is the particle' problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien’s use of the story of “Blind Touching the Dragon” to clearly explain his ideas, Norman’s expression became very dignified, as if Thinking about esoteric questions, whispered to himself: "Big bats, big lizards, waves, particles... this is an angle that has never been seen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After a while, he was delighted to have a little bitterness in his heart: "Lord Evans, with your perspective and easy-to-understand metaphor, even if the electronic is proved to be a fluctuating surname in the future, I am not worried that the cognitive world will collapse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he said his understanding again, seeking Lucien’s affirmation: "...can treat it as one we are not yet complete The things you know cannot be easily defined with partial features. They can only give a description within a certain range. This is not the daytime equals the night, but the sky can show two states, day and night. The difference in observation time causes its surname. The difference is qualitative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much easier than accepting particles directly. For unknown things, magicians always have a strong fear. What is the result of the experiment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien naturally cannot say that it should be a superposition of "daytime" and "night". Seeing Norman accepting good, he got up and said: "This is the current The discussion of some issues is mainly to let the arcane masters have a more cautious and open attitude towards the unknown things, and can not simply substitute the original concept, otherwise the blind person touches the dragon and points to the face."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arcane research is important, and the thinking of arcane research seems equally important!" Norman felt touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and nodded. This is the methodology, an external manifestation of his own worldview, reflected in what method and attitude And deal with the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman saw Luthern leaving, so he sent him to the door, sighing slightly: "Can only solve the new alchemy by treating the electrons as waves?" The problem of surgery? This makes people feel that the new alchemy has reached the most difficult time, almost no hope, the dawn that can be found is still unacceptable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The existence of matter is really true. Even Norman, the arcian who favors wave theory, is somewhat unacceptable in introducing the concept of wave into the material. It creates a weakness in the dilemma of the new alchemy. And frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have forgotten that it is just a mysterious substance that exhibits a fluctuating surname." Lucien waved goodbye, and the reversal of ideas was not something that would be completed in a while. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes left, Sean left his hand on his cheek: "...so real touch, it's hard to believe that it will have a fluctuating surname... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the president of "Elemental Will", discuss the surname article After coming out, Morris quickly got his hand and looked up. There was a self-deprecating smile in the silver-gray eyelids: "There is a new alchemy on one side and a fluctuating surname on the other. It is really hard to decide." Ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, this is the third time you sent a similar sigh today, at least within a short hour of my discussion with you, it has been three times. Florensa complained slightly. "This kind of problem is now worried about how much to do? Fluctuation can explain, it does not mean that it is not possible from the perspective of particles. It is better to spend more energy on research than to worry about it. However, your tone does not sound as embarrassing as the previous two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;She is a member of the Panel who is more capable of researching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris smiled and said: "Very sharp, Lucien explained the problem of electronics from a new perspective. If it shows a fluctuating surname, it is not impossible. Accept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Florenza reached for the paper, read it carefully, and finally smiled: "The discussion before It's fierce, but Lucien's way of thinking is also unique enough. This should be the internal factor that he repeatedly makes the subversion of his surname... It's hard to see a metaphor to simplify the problem so much."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe this is the essence of the wave-like surname." Morris sighed softly. "From the point of view of Lucian, he tends to Use the fluctuating surname to solve the problem of the new alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cornerstone of the elemental field, describing the fundamental code of the particle, and finally using the fluctuating surname to solve the problem, It’s a satire.” Florence laughed and looked a little stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris got up and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the gray weather outside, the heavy snow that blocked the line of sight, bringing a feeling of sinister repression: "Currently The new alchemy is in such a weather, surrounded by white snowflakes, can not see the direction of solving problems, caught in a difficult dilemma, can only explore step by step, even if it was unacceptable in the past, Something that is difficult to reconcile, as long as it can show the road, it must be tightly grasped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
