			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien looked around and found himself in a narrow log cabin full of strong wine when he found Elvis, almost everything In the same scene, I sat on a wooden chair, and Elvis was next to the fireplace in front of the left hand side. Outside, there was a noisy sound from the adventurer camp. The only difference was that it was supposed to be in Elvis. The wooden spoon in the hand fell to the ground, and the brass-cast soup pot fell over the fire, and the bright red tomato soup poured the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if he understood something, Lucien blurted out: "Lord of the Nightmare King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elvis" did not deny, angry conviction, his expression became haze: "Are you really a middle-level arcian?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thinks Finally, the mathematics analysis exercises that emerged in the dreams smashed the lower teeth: "I have recently deepened the mathematical foundation. Should there be high-level standards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a pause, Lucien doubted and deliberately shifted the subject: "Hello of the King of Nightmare, why do you want me to fall into a dream? And, am I really awake now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up from dreams twice in a row, everything is so real, Lucien has a bit of a difference between reality and dreams, even if the soul library is quietly opened. Can not dispel the confusion in his heart, who knows whether the soul library will appear in the same dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most mysterious magic that Lucien has seen so far! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "Elvis", now the king of nightmare Stanis, said with a smile: "I just accepted the support of an old friend. He thinks you The magic level does not match your arcane level, so you are going to let you experience different things in the dreams I have built, so that the potential of the soul can be thoroughly developed. You can feel the strength of your present soul."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the words of the king of nightmare, Lucien directly entered the meditation environment, and the familiar cognitive world gave Lucien a sense of "reality", followed by Lucien opened his eyes and was quite surprised: "My soul does have a five-ring level... Can the old witch's electric shock stimulation really enhance the soul? No, it should be a dream activity that maps to the soul, thus making the soul There is a change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of Lucien has a five-ring level, but the growth of mental power is lagging behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of nightmare Steinness nodded gently: "All dreams are based on your own cognitive foundation, psychological activities, mapping of past memories, etc. Everything that is experienced in a dream will be fed back to the body and soul, but the feedback of normal dreams is very slight. Only the world can use it to thoroughly develop the potential of the soul. Of course, it is only potential, not more than you. In its own category, if you want to continue to grow, you must practise meditation, take medicine, and hold a ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally my own perception and Based on memory mapping, it is no wonder that there will be strange coincidences such as 'electric shock stimulation' and 'magic mirror telling me'." Thought of this, Lucien subconsciously asked: "The king of nightmare, 'shock stimulation' can be enhanced Soul?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stannis pulled out a smile: "What do you say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I didn't ask. Lu Xien replied slyly. At this time, he had accumulated a lot of doubts in his heart, but he finally chose the thing that made his head explode quickly: "How do you distinguish dreams and realities from the king of nightmare?" How do I know if I am still in a dream? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stanley is accustomed to Lucien's experience of being in a state of sorrow after experiencing a "real dream", revealing an old witch-like smile: "Dream and Reality Why is it so clear? What is the truth? It is your brain's reaction to the outside world, the reaction of your soul to the outside world. As long as I can directly stimulate your brain and soul, let them produce similar reactions, what is the difference between dreams and reality? When my career comes to the end, it may be to create a dream world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, when I react to something outside, the dream creator can't completely understand the truth and the dream. "Lu Xien thoughtfully, while silently added a sentence, "When I know that the projection of a certain theory of the world can explode the head of the dream creator, the dream will naturally break. Wait a moment to quietly try the light wave of the two elephants and the quantum aspect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's no wonder that the old witch has never been interested in arcane, even if it is a dream in the dream, it is only the result of some application. This is contradictory to the madman's unscrupulous!" Lu Xien suddenly realized, then laughed, "The original old witch It’s the king of nightmare, you play that kind of crazy meaning is very real.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stannis replied blankly: “Strictly speaking, the old witch has Half is the projection of a certain horrible thing in your heart, and the remaining half is what I fill to shape and give thoughts, so that is true enough. In addition, Adam, Carina, Alva, Ophelia, Brad, etc. I played like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was awkward, this is the real version. "Don’t see a lot of people talking to you here, it’s all me. The vest?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to conceal his embarrassment, Lucien quickly asked another question: "The king of the nightmare, that is to say, this mission is purely for the sake of Let me see you, accept your dreams and develop your potential. Which is your good intention?” Can be the old friend of Stamnis, the king of nightmare, Lucine guessed at least the legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stannis is somewhat gloomy: "It's also a test. If you can't send the letter here, there is no 'real dream'. As for me. An old friend, probably because of your talent and potential, wants you to be his disciple. You should have received a similar test before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Does the strange summoning event encountered in the castle also a test?" Lucien suddenly recalled this matter, but "Vicken" has contact with the missing legendary magician such as Maskillin. It’s not like a fake, so ask again: “I don’t know who you are?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of nightmare doesn’t seem to want to mention the name: “Back You know the Magic Council. The letter on your body is actually a special magic scroll. When you are attacked by a fatal attack, it will automatically trigger, bringing you to a certain semi-plane, if you want to save back to the Magic Council. Time, you can activate it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;This special magic scroll is at least a nine-level item? I don't know how many Jintales can I change? Lu Xien suddenly had a kind of "sorrowful anger" that "has no eyes on Taishan". He runs around with such high-order items, but he doesn't know its value at all. What should he do if he loses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this also made Lucien’s grievances about the Magic Council disappear, and they did not use any tests to make themselves really in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucien take out the letter and carefully "watch", the king of nightmare Staniss waved his hand: "Go out, I will return to the magic tower." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, sir." Lucien got up and said goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucian is only the soul to enter the threshold of the five rings, but does not worry that his level of arcane can not keep up, the only problem is to spend more More time to add up to the illusion, deformation and other areas that you are not good at, at least on the basis of solid, can not be missing - the means of the king of nightmare to make Lucien is amazing, even if they can not reach this level, face When you have the magic of the faction, you can't understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out of the cabin and return to the adventurer’s camp filled with spirits and silver enamel. Lucien walks forward and has a mission. Easy, walking and walking, Lucien suddenly stopped and remembered a detail: "Is the king of nightmare not an ancient magician? Why is the mathematical analysis problem facing me be countered? He should not understand, let me dream It’s right to act on your own!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the cabin, Stamnis, the king of nightmare, did not leave immediately, but said to himself: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The closed devil's land, the towering tower, maps out his innermost fear, which seems to be the epitome of the whole world. But why does he feel that he is Closed, imprisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a dangerous environment, you can stay calm and observe, not desperate, not crazy, have a good quality, but until Ophelia When Ya died, he accelerated his escape. This shows that there have been pros who have an important position in his heart. The incident of a friend being hurt, and even death, has greatly changed his mindset, leaving a deep psychological mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adam probably It was the collective projection of the man’s surname friend who had helped him for any reason. There was a sincere side and a side of use. But why would it be called Adam? Carina also represented him and he was helped. The female surname is a friend, but there is less embarrassment and emotional occurrence, indicating that he is still uncertain about his inner feelings, or has deep concerns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
