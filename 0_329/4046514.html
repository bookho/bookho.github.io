			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression was calm, not talking, but raised his left hand, his fists stretched out, and the five fingers gathered together, like a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the world around him began to distort, the darkness receded, the cold glow shrouded, the serenity and serenity, the silver moon in the sky suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you absorbed Asin’s death surname, it seems to be a lot of recovery, but it is not enough." Annathan’s voice is like a The cat stretched out his claws and scratched the rusted iron plate. He was dumb and extremely harsh. He raised the warhammer and a gray but quiet soul flame glowed on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of a hundred meters seems to disappear, the warhammer appeared in front of Lucien, and the black and white solid monotonous world also swelled outward, and passed Everything has faded out of color and sound, as if it were to be eternal silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at it calmly, looking at "Anantas" and looking at the warhammer without the slightest sound and cracks, it was like The legendary story swallowed the tranquility of the world. Suddenly, behind him, a huge silver moon was raised, clean and clear, as if coming directly from the sky to the world, and a black devastating flame entwined in his hand, it seems to have become A real long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand slammed down, Lu Xi'an robes raised backwards, and the silver moon also swelled, dazzling, colliding with the solidification of black and white ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world seems to be chaotic, without brilliance, without sound, without space, and without time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion of this flash disappeared, Natasha and others saw a crack in the monotonous black and white gray that was shackled, and then more and more cracks, It is getting bigger and bigger, normal colors and normal winds are reflected in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Horan, the boring and solidified black and white gray world collapsed, and the surrounding world returned to normal, but Natasha and others felt physically paralyzed and slow. I still can't get back to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they saw the result of the fight, Anatans floated in the air, the temple cliff at the foot had disappeared, the river stirred up a huge whirlpool, trying Fill the deep hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decaying piece of Antanas fell, the rust-stained war god surname gave its white bones the same color, and the black and white ash in the right eye solidified. The ball of light seems to be a lot more transparent, and there are far fewer infinite changes in it. It seems that in this fight, He was not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, compared to Lucien flying to the other side of the Solna River? Evans, Annatans is obviously much better. He has hit countless river boulders, tall trees, lying on the ground and moving hard, and his left hand is covered with a layer of ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I said it is not enough!" Annathan laughed with the hoarse and squeaky voice that made people crazy, seemingly because of the mysterious world of the dead. The existence itself has not been completely awakened and interrupted by Etna. The consciousness and emotions that are now manifested are obviously more biased towards the Lord of War, or that He is a more crazy and extreme Anantas who is influenced by the mysterious existence of the Necromancer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward and looked at Lucian, who struggled to stand up but failed to do so, watching his left hand, unable to hang down, feeling very happy: "After absorbing your strength, it will be enough for me to recover completely. Although I can't kill you, I can send you into a long sleep! Etna, slowly returning from the fate of the river!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warhammer waved, the solidified world of black and white ash twisted the world again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death knell of death seems to have been ringing in Lucien’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the black and white gray world without the rest of the colors and sounds burned a green flame and completely disintegrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antanas reappears in the world, surrounded by dead gray, which is completely different from his own black and white ash, with a significant decadent taste And there is a screaming scream that can break the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Asin suddenly screamed, and the visible white vitality of the naked body quickly pulled away and rushed toward the air. In just a few seconds, his face became very pale, and the green and transparent eyes jumped out of red. The flames, the body exudes a strong undead breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centered on the Temple of War, in the area of ​​more than two hundred meters, the dark green Husum tree withered and rotted, a little fresh vitality also rushed toward the sky, the moist and fertile land instantly lost all the water, one The inch is cracked, and as the river of the Solna River flows into this area, it becomes gray and dead, causing rotten stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking clergyman in white robe exclaimed: "Life Sacrifice? Semi-God Lich?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the magical light on his body aroused the siege of the surrounding death atmosphere, the raging gray decay and holy light seems to have produced a horrible "alchemy reaction", a bang, this At least eight levels of cardinal swelled and exploded, and vitality flew into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire of purification" Danielle’s white flames linger a lot, his legs can’t support himself, knees down, with long swords When I was against the ground, I was barely lying down, and my vitality was passing fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha responded as soon as possible. She didn’t know when she was standing next to Camille, and there would have been a small crack in the truth. The shield imitation is vertical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the small and delicate black shield, the color actually fell off a bit, as if it would lose vitality, look like this, it will take a minute or two, this shield It will be rotten, but Natasha has no other way, only tough defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun god Belo lost his focal length, a stunned, vitality was pulled away, the whole body was inexplicably shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard struggles to stand up Lu Xien’s left hand is seemingly thicker and the breath is slowly weakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis, lying on the ground, couldn’t move, twisting his neck with difficulty, turning his eyes, looking at the wilderness of the bones in the distance, and suddenly he was glad that The mysterious knight flew himself far enough, which was not in the range of more than two hundred meters around Annathan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this area, the sky has already condensed a cloud full of dark feelings, a bang, black lightning lit up, a drop of gray The rain began to fall, and the smell of rotten odor made the seriously injured El directly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This septic raindrop falls on the ground, the earth instantly becomes gray, and a bone that has been buried for many years does not know how many years it has climbed, they Bathed in the rain, the atmosphere is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sign of drenching in the rain, including Danielle’s Purity Fire, Natasha’s Shield of Truth, all showing signs of decay. Fortunately, they are not the focus of the attack, the rain is pattering, there is no drop, and next to Annatans, the gray sewage is pouring down, polluting everything, melting the solid black and white world around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antanas raised the warhammer, but there was no momentum when he had just played with Lucien, as if he had a short-lived legendary attack like Aitna. ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, He is the mysterious existence of the realm of the dead, this warhammer, the broken souls around him have surrendered, no longer holding his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Anatans was to get rid of the bondage, a gloomy voice came from the sky:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul Imprisonment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken soul around Annatana, the soul warrior in the field of war, all distorted the face and turned into a soul The light penetrated into his body, causing his body to expand and contract, and the corners of his eyes overflowed with gray liquid, and the stone solidified in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life Sacrifice." The voice of the dark forest sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the cloud of filth in the sky collapsed and fell on Anantans, and the countless undead creatures that climbed around rushed to him at the same time. Incorporate into the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich life swells from Annathans, his tall and strong body is completely decayed and disintegrated, the muddy warhammer is unable to land, the skull is smashing A few pieces were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white ash solidified light ball got out of the eye socket, and it turned into several pieces of the same size and fell to the ground. It was like losing it because it was not pinned. Consciousness is still the kind of feeling that is high in the past, but it lacks a little spiritual surname, unconsciously dyes the surrounding into a monotonous still black and white gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." The voice of doubt sounded in the air, and a lich with a black cloak emerged. His face had no flesh and blood, and his white bones were directly exposed. His eyes were dark and his needles were red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, he, the demigod Lich Congers." Lucian sighed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus did not rush to find a way to take away the mysterious existence of the dead spirit, but turned his attention to Lucien, it is not a fool, will The opportunity to let Aitna slow down, as for others, there is no threat at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life stripping..." Congers read two short, strange words, this is the original magical text, it has no meaning, directly with the legend Magic deals with Lucien and his "left hand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one is about to be sent out, and a glaring ray of light is behind Congos, with a sense of order, honesty, kindness and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical defense that is self-inspired is silently dispelled under this light, but Conggs suddenly disappears in place and appears in another place, as a The legendary magician, who has no ability to defend against being attacked by several people anytime and anywhere, is considered to be dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's a spell trigger, spell sequencing, spell sequencer, or astrology, prophetic magic, etc. can achieve the same purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two red needles look at the opponent who just sneaked, but Congus found that he was the sun god Belo who had no resistance under the ritual of life. At this time, he was horrible, arrogant, and vocal in his voice: "This sword just reminds you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Congers A familiar feeling, understand that this is not the sun god Belo, but can not recognize which strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bello" did not answer, there seem to be countless white wings spread out, solemnly said: "Death must sleep, this is the order of life, you violate this The chaotic evil creature of the law, accept the trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly appeared a black balance on his left and right, and after a few shakes, he recovered his balance. The horror scenes surrounding the gray and the cloud of the sky disappeared, and the polluted land, withered trees still existed, and it was difficult to go backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Order balance, you are Rudolf II!" Congus could not understand this approach, but did not hinder the legend he would have just used. Magic is used in Rudolf II: "Life deprivation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is coming from a long distance, even if he brings the order balance, he will certainly not be able to compete with himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the face of "Bello" is aging, like a long time, and the white wings behind Rudolph II are closed. , merged into a strict order: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Return to order, Congos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Light of order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This light seems to fill the whole world, letting all unnatural existence dissipate, Congers also opened his mouth , issued a roar that can destroy the land, "the devil of the demon lich"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha and others lost their brilliance again, and they could not hear the sound in their ears. The nose seemed to have no sense of smell. The shield of truth in front of them began to The velocity is visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the bright moonlight emerged in their pupils, and Lu Xi’an, who was on the other side of the river, did not know when he was floating in the air, wearing a long black dress. The left hand is lifted high and the black is destroyed by fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does he and Silver Moon Aitna not have the ability to do it?" Such questions have emerged in the hearts of Francis and Camille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After absorbing the sacred world to dominate the name of God, Aitna has a blow, and now absorbs two surnames of God, sleeping for half a month, never in the middle After the hand, how can it be that there is no fighting power after a blow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hides near the Temple of War, trying to get his own legendary magician to fight against Anantans, thus getting out of trouble, so fight At that time, the Congens variable was budgeted, and Artena was deliberately given up all the strengths that could be used, and they were seriously injured in exchange for their first struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
