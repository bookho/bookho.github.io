			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 31st floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is already at night, the magic tower is automatically closed and no entry is allowed, but Lucien is a great arcian, naturally completely unaffected, with Natasha from His own semi-planet "Atomic Universe" jumped to his own study in the 33rd floor and set foot on the lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower at night is very quiet, walking in the silver-gray aisle, the footsteps are loud and resounding, bringing out the quiet and strange atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha just entered the area where Sky Radio was located. A white giant wolf ran out and found Lu Xien. He whimpered, kneeling on the ground, waving his tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Evans... sir, good evening, Her Majesty." Louise, wearing a light yellow simple dress, later saw Lucien I almost used to call Mr. Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing her sweet and familiar voice, Natasha was slightly surprised: "You are a nightingale lady? I like your anchor program very much, hey, you are not Louise? Alto's missing musician Louise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reminiscent of Alto's from the delicate face of the impression and the white wolf of the surname A new musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the musician Louise, but her other nickname believes that you are no stranger, mercury, magic apprentice mercury." Lucien laughed as Na Tasha introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha opened her mouth and wanted to say something. In the end, she could only laugh and laugh at herself: "The Aalto Musicians Association should change its name to Alto Magic." Association, is it easy for a musician to become a magician, or is a magician like to use a musician to disguise his identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I knew Lucien, she passed The intelligence personnel knew about the protection of Silvia, the magic apprentice mercury, but I couldn't think of it. She was actually a musician, and she actually fled to Allinge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the Aalto Sorcerer Association, obviously Aalto "study abroad" training session, Lucien silently whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise smiled and said: "Because there is a great example of a great musician and a great arcian, Queen Majesty, are you visiting the radio station?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha first looked at Lucien with a smile, and it was a good example. Then she smiled cheerfully and enthusiastically: "Because I like the voice of you and the lady of Lark. The anchor style, so I asked Lucien to take me to listen quietly, but I didn't expect to meet you directly. Your real voice is better than the magic radio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because the effects of radio and radio are still not clear." Lucien defended the radio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Louise smile who is already a three-ring magician is sweet but polite: "I am honored to be able to get the Queen’s love, but the Voice of Mystery is about to begin. Please, let me be rude to leave, Lord Evans, Samantha, they are waiting for you in the conference room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am rude, I have delayed you. Time." Natasha watched Louise enter the live room of "The Voice of Mystery" and said with a happy mood, "I just met Ms. Nightingale when I came, it seems that my bad luck has begun to improve."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the laboratory disaster in the morning, and the level of the road surpassed Lucien, able to surprise him and enjoy the strong repression, but he was suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t seen you so polite and graceful for a long time." Lucien took Natasha and crossed the door of the "Sound of Mystery" live room. Go to the meeting room at the bottom and play with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and took a look at Lucien: "My courtesy and demeanor are only for ladies, hey, you also have 'opportunities'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two laughed and talked forward, Louise behind the "Sound of Mystery" live room, but sighed softly: "Her Majesty and Evans know well. Early, when Aalto was supposed to be a couple... Now it’s finally to be overwhelmed by overcoming obstacles...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door of the conference room, all the arcane masters including Samantha got up and the right hand helped the ceremony: "Hello, you are The truth of the element, the scepter of the time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to be so troublesome, you can say a word, everyone's time is very precious." Lucy I gave a humorous opinion and then pointed to Natasha next to me. "This is my fiancée Natasha, the Queen of Holm Kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgeons, regardless of gender, exaggerated their expressions. This is the first-hand news. Lord Evans directly acknowledged the marriage contract with the Queen! At the same time, they secretly admire Natasha's beauty and temperament, and have seen the various types of female surnamed magicians. It is hard not to be surprised to see such a sultry lady, especially Natasha's own conditions are very it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha groaned, his eyes flashed, and then a sincere smile appeared: "I know your marriage contract, I wish you happiness forever."塔 < br br 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜 娜You know the surname more than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored." Samantha recovered the look of no expression, looking at Lucien, " Lord Evans is indeed the church's radio station, called the 'redemptive voice'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her words, the whispers of the Arcanists gradually Stop, the sounds in the magical array are clearly introduced into the ears of Lucien and Natasha:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We believe that there must be a race in the world, regardless of race Any profession accepts the truth, it is the virtue of love, compassion, tolerance, honesty, courage, etc. It is the light of the Lord’s love, it can make me The mind is calm, not invaded by this sinful world, and the evil wizards, dark knights, etc. that violate this universal truth are fallen, cruel, vicious, and will be destroyed..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...We are brothers and sisters, embracing each other, mourning the name of the Lord, and redeeming the soul. This time, we have invited believers from all walks of life to let them tell you What is faith, what is the virtue of love and compassion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am a believer from a slum, here, as long as I am sick, as long as Injury often means death, and a few months ago, I suffered such a serious illness, but I was lucky to survive because my neighbors, the priests of the slums, were full of love and compassion. Virtue, treat me with no compensation, take care of me, let my body recover gradually, my mind has never been calmer in this scorpion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...I used to be anxious and impatient. With all kinds of negative emotions, with the opening of the pastors, as I became more and more heartfelt, I calmed down and enjoyed the tranquility I had never had before. It was the harbor and destination of the soul..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next show is "The Cruel Magic You Don't Know." In this Rantart war, the evil magicians summoned the demon of the abyss by means of living sacrifices to humans, and the cruelty made people gesticulate. What is the specific details? I will restore you one by one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arcane master couldn’t help but smile: "The church is completely copying our program ideas! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only way to get it out so quickly is that the anchor is still a sacred female priest. "The other Arcanists also smiled and answered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't underestimate the Pope and the church's understanding of the development of arcane, but the program is too rigid. Too rigid, not lively enough, not attractive enough. Lucien nodded lightly. "Arrange special personnel to monitor this channel. You can consider responding to sensitive topics in the voice of mystery, but you can't follow their rhythm." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "The arcaneists answered in unison.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Our destiny has long been arranged by the true God, everything is doomed, only the believer can be redeemed ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this sentence, all the arcanes showed a disdainful expression, which made Natasha quite curious: "You, this is The church's definition of fate, I don't know what the fate of arcane and magic is. What is the accuracy of the prophetic magic of the star system? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-ranking magician of the astral system, Samantha solemnly and solemnly said: "In the star system, fate is also arranged, everything is doomed, but has nothing to do with the God of truth."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Natasha looked puzzled at Lucian and Samantha, and she could hardly accept the statement that her fate could not be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and told her to listen first, and felt that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why... I don’t know if the Queen’s Majesty has heard of the 'Tanos Demon’?” Samantha recalled what he had learned and intended to be as simple as possible. Language description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha shook her head: "I haven't heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien due to Just studying the astrology in depth is not very clear about the "Tanos". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the late period of the ancient magical empire, the magicians began to believe in determinism, also known as the law of causality, that as long as they knew all the conditions and parameters of a thing, Or the influence factor, you can know the result of the matter through various laws. There are certain factors, and there must be a cause." Samantha first told about the law of causality, "and with the development of arcane This concept is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As long as conditions and data are given, we can draw certain results based on the corresponding arcane theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Na Tasha is still confused, and a male surnamed Arcane singer adds a sample: "The Queen's Majesty, assuming that I have a Kintal in my hand, and then throw it away at will, it is possible to land on both the front and the back. Right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.” Natasha thought about it and looked at Lucien again, answering it earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is not like this. After the shot, just know the strength I use, Jintale's center of gravity, material, surrounding wind speed, humidity and many other conditions. According to the Douglas movement system, it can be calculated which side it will land, there is no other possibility." The arcane master said with pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcans explore the world, discover and summarize the laws, and then use the laws to predict the "trajectory" of the world's operations. The more precise the mastery is. This is the charm of the Arcane, making people like the gods of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha thought carefully: "I understand, at this moment of throwing Jintal, all factors are determined, so the result is doomed "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After understanding, this is determinism, this is the law of causality, and 'Tanos demon' is the greatest four in the history of the astrology One of the magicians' 'Sun King' Tanos proposed a concept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha returned to the original topic, "He will be the current state of the world Considering the future cause of the future, so suppose that there is a very powerful demon of wisdom, know all the current states and laws, and master every atom, 呃, every proton, neutron, electron, then it You can apply the law and accurately trace back all the things that happened in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, it can also be predicted by reason Anything that will happen in the future, the future will be definitely displayed in front of it as in the past, this is the 'Tanos demon', Telling every magician of the astrology system, the fate of the whole world has been doomed since its birth. There will be no change. We cannot accurately predict that the future lies only in the fact that we don’t know enough and the rules are not complete enough.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is completely unable to accept this fatalistic law of causality: "Everyone's mind is unpredictable."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, from the perspective of the illusion system, each person's family name is affected by the environment around him, that is to say, the name is determined by a large number of factors, and the determined surname, plus All other factors in making a decision, the unpredictable people will actually give a doomed answer. Her Majesty, did you guess his reaction based on the opponent’s surname and past style when you made the battle plan? The more you don't know, the more accurate this guess is.” Samantha's voice is light and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded, but shook her head, not knowing how to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha is rare to show a proud and slightly sentimental look: "Every astrologer of the astrology will be proud of being able to see the fate." It will also grieve for the fate of being unable to change. This is cruel and cold, but it is a fact. If there is a cause, everything has been decided in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
