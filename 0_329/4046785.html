Anna repeated the name in a low voice, filled with fear of restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people standing in front of the altar are their future lords, Viscount Andrei, who has a well-defined face, rough and hard It is gloomy. Like other members of the Vladimir family, he has golden hair, blue eyes and a unique tough guy style. Unfortunately, his eyes are filled with the horror of the name, but I don’t know it. The Daren and the Frost Giant Knights were easily defeated and feared, or they were panicked because they were blocked in worshipping the demon scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Anna did not pay attention to the expression of Viscount Andrea, she was full of intelligence, stories and legends about the other side: the genius knight, the future of Calcut The Earl, a member of the Vladimir family, was promoted to the Grand Knight at a young age, and was recently seen by the epic knight as a student of the other party...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These titles And deeds, even if they come out alone, can make Anna's ordinary mercenary feel fearful, so after the combination, even if Viscount Andre has not yet started, even if he is surrounded by a powerful magician Katrina sister And the handsome vampire, like a legend, she also trembled from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must have excelled, even in the five-level knights, it is certainly the most outstanding minority, otherwise it is impossible to be seen by the epic knight... ···””<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“He is the future Earl of Calcutt. If the battle is discovered, the Knights who arrive will definitely kill us...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, he is a student of the epic knight, 'Death storm, Ninell doesn't know if he has given him high-end items and special power... Catri If Sister Na killed him, would she be chased by the epic knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas emerging in the heart of Anna at the same time, not mentioning Katrina's sister And the handsome vampire can beat Prince Andre, the identity of his epic knight student will make people scrupulous, fearful, afraid to put him to death - Andre has just become his own student two It was killed in three months, and the "death storm" Ninère will definitely feel a slap in the face. The presence Epic Knight who spared lost control of the forces of death to kill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar worries, fears and fears permeate every mercenary. Yakov is no exception, but he quickly stabilizes his emotions. It is the Viscount Prince Andre who wants to kill himself and others. If he does not resist, he will definitely die now. If he resists, he may still be alive in the future. After all, relative to the epic knight and Count Calcutt, he and others are just small ants on the ground. Running a little further, maybe they are too lazy to chase themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how to choose it is self-evident! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shouldn’t come in, this is what you forced me, forcing me..." Andre in front of the altar Repeating this sentence, and the blood fog that spreads on the altar is getting thicker and thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to him?" Although Viscount Kareldia is self-proclaimed and knowledgeable, he still cannot understand the current state of Andre. So, ask through Katrina's pre-Binding Spiritual Connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina indifferent as the eyes of the golem looked at the visceral Viscount Andrea, calmly judged: "Probably we interrupted the ritual, Let him be eroded by the power of the demon, in a short state of mental abnormality, seize the opportunity to take him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she spoke, she lit up The pure and splendid brilliance of the layers, and then the fireworks burst out with a dazzling ray of light, constantly screaming at the thick bloody fog, the dark statues and the wonderful altars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she applied the "light of mystery", she was like a feather woven into a ray of light, sacred, solemn and solemn, seen in Anna, Jacob In the eyes of husbands and others, it is like angels coming to the world. Slowly unfolding the wings of light behind them. These spells are created by the magical parliament with reference to the magical technique. They are very similar in appearance except for the special fluctuations without magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the road hits the blood fog, and the glare is bright, but the blood fog around the altar is obviously stronger than that in the outer hall. Those who dissipated as the wind blows, they are only a little thinner after being hit by the "light of mystery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his words and gestures, a black line lit up on the floor, they spread from all directions, drilled into the altar, forming a three-dimensional magical array, and the dark fog in the center of the altar Let the statue looming, with a hint of coldness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quick hands, the ceremony is almost finished!" Katrina is performing "Luce's big fireball", "Sunburn", "Thundercloud" "When the magic attacked the altar and Viscount Andre, he urged the Viscount Kareldia to start." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the ceremony started, she felt a strong danger. The ceremony was almost finished, just waiting for the final start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia snorted: "I thought things would go very well..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloak behind him rises to the rich darkness, and together with himself, the altar is shrouded and the magic patterns are eroded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Andreas Viscount in the magical array protection looked at the blood, dark fog, and magical patterns that gradually collapsed under the joint action of the two, hazy Shaking his head: "All of you forced me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a dagger without flashing light from the storage bag, but it was white, but it looked Hard and rigid, dead-hearted, seeing it as if you saw the call of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the invitation letter from the teacher, the high-level dagger, Ninier, and now I use it as a sacrifice for the ceremony. In the ceremony Under the urging, it will turn into a pure and thorough death storm, and no one can escape!” Viscount Andrea madly laughed and threw “Nignel’s invitation” into the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the master of darkness, the incarnation of despair, you will freeze the world in the last days..." Viscount Andrei raised his hands high and read out loud The ritual prayer, like a cult priest, beats the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They worship the 'Devil Prince, Gonheim!' The deeds of the Dark Lord are often heard in the Atomic Research Institute in recent months, so Katrina is no stranger, reminding the Viscount Kareldia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the altar, the darkness of the strands of the scorpion swelled around a layer of frost, and suddenly, the altar and the whole main house and the village violently swayed, a group The darkness is deeper, and the desperate cyclone emerges more slowly than the cold. As soon as I see it, Anna feels a chill from the heart, like the feeling of being dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mercenaries, including Yakov, were sucked by the cyclone, and as they turned, they felt their soul and body Disputes and wrestlings can't be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, under the influence of more and more severe cyclones, the darkness outside the altar was picked up, and countless black bats hit the wall and lost all vitality. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death Storm···························································································· Tao, "I hate this kind of ritual to fight the power of high-order items..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While he spoke, he took out a Photo frame · Inside is a portrait of a silver-silver-eyed Rhine. Compared to myself, the oil painting is more correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiencing the sense of death from the depths of the soul, Anna desperately and fearfully said: "Is this the power of legend? Just a trace of the epic knight Breathable high-end items can produce such terrible power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head hard and looked at Katrina, wanting her to ignore herself, hurry Escape, with her strength should be able to escape, but the kind of death shocked, she opened her mouth but could not make a sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what is Katrina’s sister doing..." The brain is close to the blank. Anna suddenly sees Katrina’s left hand constantly pressing a silver A badge with various mysterious symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, you will soon be able to taste the 'death storm, the taste.'" Andre, regardless of the surrounding blood fog, magical array under constant attack It’s crumbling and laughing wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna painfully wants to close her eyes, the pressure of death is too uncomfortable, but at this time, she heard Katrina’s high-pitched voice, The usual voices are very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna was shocked to see an innocent starry sky behind Katrina, dark and deep, brilliant stars, emitting a variety of colors different from normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stars are coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The universe is coming?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She and Yakov and others have a similar question in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, they felt the vastness of the universe, the subtlety of the stars - and there seemed to be endless mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This innocent feeling suddenly eased the hearts of their oppressed and oppressed, and no longer felt a trace of despair and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, what is this power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a legend?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their large eyes, a gaseous planet has changed, filling into a "blue" that freezes everything, and Katrina throws a tube in his right hand. Color liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "Atomic Universe" blessing, she did not use the mantra, directly let the test tube break, let the liquid condense into a colorless strange ray, and then hit In the middle of the magical array of broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water vapor freezes, the blood fog freezes, the surrounding air freezes, the blue, the light blue, the transparent and so on, and the black death storm that broke out is also frozen. Like a piece of black snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this, Viscount Andre also froze, the item cracked, the skin was like ice crystals, the blood became completely solid, and the expression on the face solidified at the end. In the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the cold disappeared, everything began to melt, and everything before it became a dripping drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this incredible scene, Anna and others only felt that they were still dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I knew you had this kind of preparation in advance, I wouldn’t take the photo frame out..."... Viscount Carrendia’s portrait of Rhein Collapse, "Evans's extreme cold rays?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Katrina's face was quite pale, with a drop of cold sweat on her forehead, " It seems that Andrea’s worship of the 'Dark Lord, ritual, in order to enhance their strength and potential.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be, otherwise it is impossible Not long after the ceremony ended, he became a student of the 'Death Storm, and the Dark Lord, the devil king is the most devil-like, and it is normal to develop believers.” Viscount Kareldia was thoughtful. nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror-like light curtain in a castle completely reflects what happened in the Duda Manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, in fact, you can easily kill them." A glamorous sexy woman kneels beside a young man, feeding him red wine with his mouth Her forehead has a pair of cute black horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man stroked the woman’s hair and slowly removed her gaze from the light curtain. He had a face that was exactly the same as Viscount Andrea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what about killing? One is a student of the Arcanist, one is a close descendant of the vampire prince, you said things will calm down "Andre" laughed. "Change to a general magician and a vampire. Kill it and kill it. Slightly cover it up, find a murderer. The Magic Council and the Vampires won't pay too much attention. But now, come. These two, can only give them an 'answer, anyway, our plan has been successful, Andre’s identity can also disappear.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sexy The woman nodded. "Yeah, if we continue to be traced by the Magic Council and the Vampires, we will have a lot of trouble in the future. However, how do you know that the Magic Council is sending Katrina, the student of the atomic control? Otherwise, Duda had already killed Yakov on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre" smiled and did not directly answer: " Anyway, anything So far, I don't want them to have an accident, otherwise Lucien = Iraq Sri Lanka and Rhein=Karenrdia may have come over. This kind of thing that has been played with small ones is the most troublesome and most annoying. 哎····..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
