			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien cutting off the flesh and blood on his broken arm and drawing a line symbol wrapped in a circle, a strange mystery gradually spreads out. As if it represents the most abstract and deep secret of the human body and the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina looked at Lucien’s magical array and muttered in her mouth: “These three symbols seem to symbolize spirit, consciousness and carrier, respectively. They are the same level, probably representing the soul. The five symbols of the same level are the traditional symbols of the Necromancer, symbolizing blood, bones, flesh, internal organs and vitality. They may be used to represent the body, leaving four suns, silver moons. The stars and the dark symbols may represent the world outside the body. This is a magical array that combines the magic of the dead and the magic of the stars. And depending on the location and connection, it seems that there are different changes and different The role of "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity to see and learn the knowledge of the deep magical array is very rare for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After drawing the basic symbols of the Necrotic "Miranda Life Twelve Rings" magic array around the energy pool, Lucien changed the remaining bones and flesh and blood. It becomes a semi-solidified viscous liquid, and then as a "magic ink" draws a unique connection between the twelve rings, with a dark symbol as the core connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do all this, Lucien smeared the thick flesh and blood liquid as a "magic conductor" into the connecting path, and finally, with the help of Adam's flesh and blood, Re-shaping and changing the "dark symbols", "blood symbols" and "conscious symbols". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint glow of life feelings illuminates with the help of Lucien’s spirit and quickly spreads along a fixed passage, soon The entire "Miranda Life Twelve Rings" magic array has become a whole, and the light is fiercely restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array is no longer as messy and fragmented as before, all the symbols and connections seem to constitute a unique open life, giving a wonderful three-dimensional illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina’s heart is fascinated by this magical array of art, constantly interpreting each symbol, the representative behind each line. significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a voice rang in her ear: "Karina, wait, as long as the energy pool begins to boil, you use mental power to stimulate the dark symbols."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Carina stunned and found that Lucien was talking to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was repeated, she said with a red face: "Mr. Lucian, rest assured, I will have a good time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, this time can only fully believe her, after all, I have not yet learned the opportunity to mimic magic, you can split your own, then turn to two Knight said: "Alva, Brad, you are responsible for guarding Carina, don't let anything disturb him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, Mr. Lucian "Alva and Brad solemnly perform the Knights." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not jealous, look to the side of Adam: "Adam, we set out to go to the core of the magic tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem!" Adam was a little bit eager to try. He was shut down by the old witch for decades. After a long time of experimental materials, he couldn’t wait to fight back. Escape is a coward's choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ When the loud noise, the two steel golems fell to the ground, and the hands and feet seemed to have some uncontrollable bounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Adam was very impressed: "If I am alone, unless I can get a lot of room for activity, even a steel golem is difficult. It's easy to get rid of, and you just destroy a fierce and unstoppable one with just one magic. It's incredible and magical. Hey, I regret that I didn't learn magic at the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the progress of knowledge." Lucien answered in a concise manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucien walked past the steel golem and shook his head and looked at the magical pattern on the steel body. "A lot of things are good and there are disadvantages. If there is no such magical array, then you can make a metal shell to effectively shield the magnetic field interference of the steel magic image, but how can the simple alloy block the attack of the big knight and The bombing of elemental magic? Unless the knowledge progresses again, this structural dilemma can be effectively solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical array at the core of the Magic Tower is much more complicated than the protection of energy, but fortunately it still belongs to the common high-level magical array, which has reference to the data of the Arcanists' predecessors, so Lucien used it for a full hour and a half. It cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one and a half hours is a torment for the “Jailbreakers” who are racing against time. Even Adam’s determined five-level knight can’t help it. Awkwardly pacing back and forth, any slight movement will make him react greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his performance, Lucien can guess that Carina, Alva, and Brad in the energy room are estimated to be tight and close to collapse. When the old witch does not need to come back, just a flurry of bloody knights can scare them to make radical actions, even fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the distance between the core of the magic tower and the energy is far, beyond the scope of the secondary mind connection, Lucien can't contact Carina, only Can maintain the attitude of believing teammates and open the black door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the flashing black metallic luster back, Adam sighed with a long sigh of relief: "This is the most difficult one and a half hours in my life. The old witch did not appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, there is danger waiting for us behind." Lucien carefully observed the stairway behind him and resolutely stepped on it. Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if there are other powerful guards in the core of the Magic Tower. I don’t know if there is a unique magic array protection in the control hub. I don’t know if the control is successful or not. The old witch who will surely be alarmed after starting the experiment can come back in time... This series of unknown clouds are shrouded in Lucian’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam's body gradually darkened, carefully following Lucien on the silver-gray stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two just stepped on a few steps, and the entire narrow staircase suddenly squirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver-gray walls and steps quickly become blood red, revealing a trace of flesh-colored, and constantly secreting pure white, greenish acid, rotten Lucy En "the spell absorbing wall" sizzles and expands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkened Adam was drenched by these "acids" and gave a slight scream of pain. Fortunately, the injury was not very heavy, he remained calm. There is no blind attack, so as not to alarm the old witch: "Man, what is going on? Isn't it supposed to be immune to acidity after I am dark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is old The witch's unique magic seems to be able to rot and digest the soul, not just the acid!" Lucien said in the secondary mind connection, running at full speed and dragging a long afterimage. "This seems to be The magical array that must be activated, even if the old witch comes, will inspire, but she will definitely display the corresponding magic protection in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot of magicians One of the effective defenses against your important items and places can kill those who think they have cracked all the magical arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lucian and Adam did not care, and this came from fear and alertness against the old witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire blood red staircase is squirming wildly, like the human stomach is digesting food, strange and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Adam were suffering from "acid" damage, madly climbing and rushing toward the exit above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit is like an open mouth, with red lips and white teeth. They are closing quickly, as if they have time constraints! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucian and Adam, who superimposed the acceleration, were flying fast, getting closer and closer to the exit, seeing only a short stairway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, the layer of light flowing through the mysterious magic symbol absorbed the limit, broken and turned into a shining spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you see the more you go, the faster the exit is closed. Lucien doesn’t waste valuable spelling buffers and then cast a “smart absorption wall”. Instead, he pulled Adam next to him and inspired "short-range teleportation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash, Lucien and Adam appeared on the stairs in front of the exit seven or eight steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just showing his body shape, Lucien seems to have expected it, regardless of his burning pain, his feet slammed, shot like an arrow, passing through two rows of teeth that are about to close, falling on a thick carpet. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned over and turned back and saw Adam also rushed in. Lucien just relaxed a little, hurry up, look around, completely disregarding the body's acid Corrosive flesh and hurt the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the study room of the old witch, with several rows of bookshelves on one side, several beautiful women's stone carvings on the other, and a beautifully decorated desk in the middle. At the intersection of countless patterns, there is a crystal clear crystal ball that reflects the state of the entire magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind the desk, there is a sly old lady wearing a red magic robe, her skin is loose, wrinkles deep, dry and terrifying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Witch?!" In the secondary mind connection, Lucien and Adam both blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Lucien subconsciously inspires magic, he suddenly notices that he is not right, and forcibly stops, and quickly swears to Adam: "Don't attack, it is an illusion!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is a little shocked and unpredictable: "Imagination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A six-ring magic that can be made I have the same illusion as myself, and control her movement and speaking, but I can't cast spells. The old witch seems to be used to guard against this, as long as the subconscious attack her illusion, she can sense it." Lucy Enping resurrected the beating heart, then applied "medical surgery" to treat the wounds that were spattered by "acid". He used nearly ten magics and helped Adam with the help of Adam's darkness to make this difficult injury. it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam whispered: "Although the old witch is a bit crazy, it is actually very sinister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recovering the injury and mental strength, Lucien once again added a defensive magic to himself, then walked to the crystal ball and tried to resolve this "control hub." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waited for nearly an hour, time passed to the middle of the night, Lucien finally completed the analysis, his right hand extended to press on the crystal ball, muttering in the mouth The spirit is condensed into acupuncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the crack, but must also erase the old witch's spiritual imprint, in order to grasp the crystal ball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritual force follows the road that Lucien cracked, like a fish-like circumvention of heavy obstacles, instantly reaching the core, rushing toward the mark of the old witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the threat is felt, and the crystal ball illuminates like a brilliant sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical pattern follows, and the power of the entire magic tower is concentrated on the crystal ball to kill the invaders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the energy room, Karina saw the energy pool begin to boil, and quickly launched the "Miranda Life Twelve Rings" magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve rings illuminate at the same time, the darkness swells, shrouds the entire energy, and everything seems to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Carina, Alva, and Brad took the initiative and turned and fled to the door between the energy in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy flow was cut off, and the protection of the spiritual mark in the crystal ball came to an abrupt end, letting it face the spiritual attack of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this spiritual imprint cannot be erased, Lucien was succumbed to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten seconds, only ten seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the old witch behind the desk exudes a sense of life, and the angry voice is coming: "Two abominable flies, I want to make you a mummy." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is getting stronger and stronger, just one second, the illusion of the old witch becomes a real person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six Ring Magic "Location Exchange!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
