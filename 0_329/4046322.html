			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror is dark, nothing is reflected, but there is a flattering voice: "Udura, you have always been the most beautiful woman in the world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch satisfactorily put down the mirror: "Very good, Trios, you are always the most honest mirror in the world, not destroyed by me." The faces that fell are as hypocritical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"La la la, Udura hair is as bright as the sun, eyes are clear and green like a lake, lips are rosy like a rose Petals..." The magic mirror Trios sang joyfully, "sincerely" praised the "worse" appearance of the old witch Udura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch’s voice was also cursed and cursed, and laughed: "Trios, I will give you after we leave this damn ghost place. Inlaid with your favorite gems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the laughter, she put down the mirror and turned her eyes to Lucien. Suddenly, she screamed loudly. The horrible sound waves made the Lucien eardrum tremble like a magic, and the mind was dizzy, and they stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close your eyes! Close your eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not sure why There will be such a change, close your eyes, and then you will hear the footsteps and fierce cursing sounds of the witch walking back and forth: "Your eyes are broken, your eyes must be broken, otherwise how will you reflect me? In the ugly appearance, I want to dig..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a conservation, and can keep calm and wait for the opportunity, Lucien can't help but sneak a few words, hurry The words interrupted the old witch: "Ms. Udura, what do you want to find me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the old witch is determined to dig his own eyes, it will be troublesome. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dangerous to deal with a madman! It’s dangerous to be inexplicable anytime, anywhere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Udura stunned and seemed to have been diverted from attention and did not continue to go crazy: "I let you come to draw your blood and the blood of this girl." Mix."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, fortunately, the experimental things can make her recover a little awake, Lucian quietly vomited, then asked doubtfully: "She is The second-level knight, the blood is not worse than me, why do you want to mix?" It is not like Natasha's parents use the way of birth to mix two top blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indicating the specific content of the experiment, Udura became fanatical but calm: "Before you took a little bit of your blood while you were sleeping, you found the same level as the other The moonlight has a stronger resilience, and it seems that the high vampire uses his blood essence to help you improve. This has the hope to make up for the rejection caused by the direct mixing of the blood. And if this second-level knight can fuse the super recovery Ability, I will be honored to be my new body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia’s eyes fixed on the dissection table are desperate, tears in the corners of the eyes have dried up After many experiments, she began to numb, and she intended to spend a day in this day, waiting for the escape of the offline meeting, but I did not expect that the bad luck will come to my head, the old witch will even receive the final hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Lucien is very sympathetic to the fate of Ophelia, but he has not been relieved of the imprisonment, he can not even resist the hints of the old witch, can only be lost Stumbled down to another dissection table and lay down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, the metal ring locked Lucien’s hands and feet, and a pipe with a snake-like black needle plunged into the blood vessels of Lucien’s left hand. Inside, the sharp pain made Lucien wake up, and then felt the blood pumped out and slowly flowed to Ophelia not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia is wrapped in a lot of lines, like being wrapped in tentacles. The blood is mixed with different gem powders, magical plant powders, etc. under the action of the magic array, and then injected in a drop along the pipeline. Her empty eyes are unable to restrain the painful reaction, and the blood vessels of the body are highlighted like a python. Come out, as if it will burst at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch picked up the magic wand of the black magic snake, and the magic array under Ophelia lit up one by one, blue, golden, The six colors of silver white, dark green, pure black and red are blooming one after another, and the two blood vessels begin to merge slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This direct integration has caused Ophelia to suffer so much that she can’t wait to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be successful?!" The old witch’s voice rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, a loud bang, blood flying all over the sky, creating a patter of bloody rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia’s blood vessels all blasted open, revealing a calm smile. She finally did not have to accept torture as she wished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tragic scene left Lucien with an unforgettable impression that a living life was tortured to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was said that Lucien was originally sympathetic to them because they first accepted the inheritance of the ancient magicians, then now they finally understand even a few legends. The magician is missing, and the strength is stronger than that of the ancient magical empire of the church. Why suddenly the internal and external troubles and the wall collapsed, so it is necessary to guide the ancient inheritance of the magicians to the road of arcane, and let the history be unacceptable. The wheels are crushed without mercy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no!" The scream of the old witch came, and she quickly stood in a magical array filled with gems, frantically extracting energy. It blooms the whiteness of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia’s last magical array illuminates, showing a deep black color corresponding to the milky brilliance of the old witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the deep black began to appear a hint of milky white, and the milky white also appeared dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process, a glimpse of the excellent opportunity Lu Xien forcefully dragged his metal ring, wants to destroy the life of the magic array when running out of old The witch, but the metal ring is firmly locked, can not break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrist was smeared with blood and blood, and without the blood power and magic, Lucien could not break the metal ring made by the magic alloy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light is converted and quickly fades, the Ophelia injury on the dissection table is fully restored, and the skin exudes an attractive luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ophelia" read the spell, lifted his bondage, then jumped down like a deer, and couldn’t wait to pick up the mirror Terry Oss, caressing the mirror: "The mirror mirror tells me, who is the most beautiful woman in the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Youdu Pull!" The mirror is no longer dark, gradually crystal clear, reflecting the "Ophelia" blond delicate appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch Udura satisfactorily looked left and right, from time to time combing short hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, who heard their conversation, once again felt the strange feeling, why did she meet the old witch twice, and she said what she once knew? It can be seen from the facts but has another basis, not just reading your own memories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to see the “who” youthful and beautiful old witch can’t wait to stick to the mirror, the golden eyebrows that are as fine as needles, tall and small The bridge of the nose, the thin red lips and the skin of the surname, all of which made her very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the skin that shines with youthful brilliance faints, the clear green eyes are turbid, and a wrinkle appears at a speed visible to the naked eye... The old witch stays I saw that I was re-aging in just a few tens of seconds, and the tall, straight back was smashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible scream is raging, and many of the magic labs are engraved The glass tubes of the magic array were broken one by one, and the mirror of Trios had a crack in the road. Lu Xien once again showed signs of deaf roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch’s scream looks like a banshee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the old witch calmed down, looking at Lucien coldly, not knowing what was being calculated, then reading the mantra and letting go Locking Lucien’s metal circle, suggesting that he stood up and walked out of the door, and summoned the servant to come in and command: “Take him back to his cell.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t Lu Xi'an interrogated and lobbied, using the opportunity to restore youth to induce her to contact the Arcane, and drove Lucien out of the fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the way back to the cell, Lucien looked as silently as before, and looked at the flesh-and-blood knights who took the extraordinary axe and the giant sword. From time to time, they looked at the wound that began to recover on the wrist, thoughtfully. Wrinkled his brows and firmed the idea of ​​finding an opportunity to escape as soon as possible, because no one knows what a madman will do unexpectedly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking in the evening, with the secret communication between Lucien and Adam, and the mouth of a young servant, Carina, Alva, Brad All three knew Ophelia's tragic end, one by one, became mentally embarrassed, as if she could not accept her, she left the world, and she had a good morning servant service to exchange breakfast with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it would be tragic enough to be an experimental material. I didn’t expect to have a more horrible end to wait for myself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently scattered back to the cell, Lucien rang the wall on the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Lucian?" Karena’s weak voice passed through the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien will take off the stone bricks dug in the afternoon and look at the neck opposite Karina: "Karina, want to escape? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Carina slammed down, and her green eyes with tears looked at Lucien: "Mr. Lucian, you Is there a way to take us out? I don't want to stay in this ghost place anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia's death has caused her great Psychological blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes solemnly said: “Any move to escape will be extremely dangerous, but it will be stronger than sitting here. If you want to follow me I need you to do one thing, this will cause you a lot of pain, don't you know if you are willing or not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucien's tone is extremely solemn Carina did not blindly agree, and after a moment of silence, she nodded firmly. "As long as I can escape from here and get rid of the witch's pursuit, I can bear what kind of pain. Mr. Lucian, you can do anything for me." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you lean over your neck." Lucien's voice was gentle and calm, and Karina's nervousness was comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina stood up and leaned her neck in front of the empty brick wall. Some of them realized: "Mr. Lucian, you are going to analyze the banned collar." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can't see it myself." Lucien didn't lie, then gently said: "Resist the pain."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Carina nodded gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reached out with his right hand, touched the forbidden collar on Carina’s neck, and then slowly moved to a special position according to the initial interpretation. Pushing slowly, while another finger hits the wall steadily, creating a tiny, unique vibration that constantly changes, much like a hard, whimsical mantra that can be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the double influence of vibration and pushing, the banned collar begins to flash silver-white electric awning, while at the bottom of the electro-optic is a rune that keeps flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina was erect with tiny hair and her body trembled, and she could barely see her lips biting. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien’s soul computing ability still exists, it is basically impossible to hit different special vibrations by the body without blood power at present, and the frequency is quickly out of shape. accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for Lucien, it would be enough to provoke the banned collar without threatening Carina’s surname. If there is no vibration frequency affecting the magic array to play a role, reduce part of the current, under the long-term observation, the collar in the spine is easy to let Karina, a pure magician who does not stimulate blood power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien did not observe too long, so as not to cause an accident, but also gave Karina enough time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, Lucien recalled the runes and structures he remembered before, and asked again: "Karina, are you willing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, Mr. Lucian!" Carina gnawed her teeth, and although the electric shock was painful, there was at least hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
