			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the monotonous black-and-white world, Douglas, Fernando, and Lucien have no direct space jumps, but instead fly in midair, and powerful pressures are emitted, even if There is no unscrupulous undead creature, and I know that I am far from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of collecting emotions transforms itself into a state similar to that of ancient devils, and then uses the power of faith and the fusion of space energy to step into a god-like At the pace, Lord Tanos is one of the greatest magicians on the star system. He is the first advanced level outside the natural class of God..." Douglas was born in the Wizarding Empire of Hillsanas. At the end of the period, it was far from the time when Tanos was in power, but he was often stunned in life and study, so he was still used to calling him a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a lot about this matter, saying that it is not heart-warming, that is a fake, the road to become a god is clearly displayed in front of you, I am afraid Who can control his mood well, Fernando is okay, he has not been promoted to the legendary peak for a long time, far from being qualified to take the level of this step, but he is different, in the legendary peak for hundreds of years, known as It is enough to compare with the Sun King before the Fall. If you want to, you can collect the power of emotions in a dozen years, and rearrange the magic array, and then “borrow” the power of Heaven Mountain with the help of monsters. God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the hidden dangers of Tanos and Viken as a kind of god are also clearly displayed in front of themselves, and they start from the cognitive world. The road from the general theory of relativity, although not clear enough, undoubtedly shows a bright future. After a few decades, after a few decades, it may be possible to advance to the gods without any hidden danger. Therefore, Greed is easy to be restrained, especially when the original road has just dawned, not desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say that they are simply stunned by desires, doing something extremely stupid, the ancient devil itself is not a god, it is converted into What is the significance of their state in addition to the ability to accept the power of faith?" Even for the forerunner of the magical empire of Thanos, Fernando did not care, and rudely degraded their research, "Of course, they It also has its own value and gives us an example of failure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicken, which can actually use 'God Drop' multiple times, is very dangerous The existence of us, we have not yet had the ability to fight against Him. Therefore, in our own efforts to go to the level of the gods, we must find out the path of God by looking for His weakness." Douglas is very cautious, except for monsters, who It is not clear how many times Viking can use the "God Drop". "We can't think of the failure because of this road. We don't think about it. We should include the ancient devil into the scope of the study." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and studied the ancient devil to help him master the mystery and essence of the state transition and discover the truth of the world: "There will be one day I am going to explore the ancient ruins in the deepest part of Hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Hell" looks at himself, without the power of legendary peaks, Lucien Dare to run to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there is enough interest to exchange, even if you kill a Duke of Hell, the Lord of Hell will not mind, let alone damage the projection of this small thing. 'But, however, you must beware of Him's conspiracy in the dark for greater benefit." Douglas is not strange to Hell's Lord. He went to Hell to explore many times. "When this thing calms down, I go to hell the deepest." The ancient ruins of the place, for the collection of 'information' for research, you do not take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord of the Speaker, you can rest assured that the harvest of this adventure is enough for me to digest for a long time. And, before becoming a legendary peak, I would rather go to the abyss and not go to hell." Lucien said with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando heard the word "harvest" and remembered the "immortal chamber" and said to himself: "The secret of immortality is the starry skyscape? What is this?" The secret of immortality... Is it really better to see it than the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so, 'Starry Skyscape' and it can't be touched, A surname that cannot be approached may have a secret hidden, and this secret is related to immortality. Fernando, have you forgotten that we have not found the existence of the planet in the universe until now? Even if we look back at the world below, I can't see it, as if it was concealed by what power, but in the immortal chamber, but there is a starry skyscape, there may be some connection between the two, can solve this mystery, perhaps touched the secret of immortality." Douglas from pure The arcane angle analyzes the situation of the immortal chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this "relevant" is quite different from the imagination of a normal person. Lucien has some speculations and thoughts on it, but it needs more theoretical foundations and findings of phenomena to verify and modify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the real roads of the world has always been a bold assumption, careful verification, and indispensable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is accustomed to rebuttalism: "Not necessarily, general relativity does not discuss whether light will bend in the gravitational field? We calculate the planet from the starlight The location may be very different from the actual one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is entirely possible." Douglas and Lucien nodded in agreement, especially Lucien was clearly aware of " The phenomenon of gravitational lens exists. Of course, this still needs to be verified by practical astronomical phenomena and "field test". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sees that they have no objections, and immediately has no interest in discussing this matter, and has shifted the topic: "There is another phenomenon related to this, when exploring the endless ocean According to Douglas's theory, we should reach the other side of the dark mountain range. However, when the legendary magicians of the past generations explored the moonlight sea on the other side of the endless ocean or dark mountain range, no matter how positioned, it will eventually return to an area passing through the road. It is impossible to verify the existence of the planet in a circular world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most famous mysteries after Douglas proposed the theory of celestial movement, Lucien has long been I know and guess, I suspect that there is space folding and so on. I can never think of why this is the case. I will not open the immortal chamber and see the familiar starry sky scene. I will have a certain direction. I will silently say this. The harvest of the second adventure, it is time to explore the end of the endless ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Fernando ridiculed the Lord of Hell without any politeness: "Maldi Moss has always regarded himself as the smartest creature, but in me. It seems that his degree of no brain is similar to that of the abyss. How can the secret of immortality be placed directly there to make people know that the secret of immortality should be a phenomenon, the trajectory with the stars, and the surname of the elements, and Natural geography, the same phenomenon as the development of biology, only contains the mystery of immortality, which must be studied to gain something!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mardimo After seeing the 'Starry Skyscape', he did not ask a few reasons. He was directly disappointed and ridiculed, indicating that it was only a little smarter than the abyss, or could not get rid of the low IQ creature's surname!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher, your mouth is really poisonous, this is the typical arcane thinking, where is the Lord of Hell? Lucian smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is also a similar expression. You usually think that I have too many problems. Now I laugh at Mardi Moss and ask why. It’s really wrong. He laughs. Shaking his head: "Well, for the time being, we will not discuss the starry sky scene in the immortal chamber. We still have to target the current arcane theory. Perhaps as we uncover the mysteries of the microcosm, we will understand the mystery of the macroscopic starry sky. The secret of immortality is naturally presented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most correct approach." Lucien agreed, suddenly remembered, "President Excellency, about the things of Tanos and Viken, are we spreading out widely, shaking the foundation of the faith of the Church of Truth, causing the suspicion of the members of the Cardinal Mission, or secretly hiding them to tie the priests?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A large-scale spread out? The Voice of Mystery has been broadcasting for several years. The believers have become accustomed to the various black history of the church. There are many exaggerations. , the effect may not be Good. "Douglas muses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is for the countries of the Stormwind Strait and the North Coastal Corridor, because there are several magic radios and radio hosts in at least one block. It is either a member of the Magic Council, or likes to listen to everyone, let the "Sound of Mystery" cover a large part of the crowd, and with the Holm Kingdom and so on completely fall to the Parliament, Lucien invented the "Manor Big Horn" "The Grand Horn of the Square" has done a good job of popularization, so that the vast majority of civilians can hear the "voice of mystery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the sea opposite the sacred Heilz Empire, except for the big nobility, the magic radio is a rare thing, the church does not have that ability, and there is no need for it. The popularization of similar magical items, they broadcast the broadcast in the church, to attract believers to pray, so the "voice of mystery" coverage in these places is very poor, can only rely on the secret intelligence of the intelligence agents sent by the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lucine’s opinion, this is a “spy game”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's better to use both methods, and to use the 'Mystery Voice' to spread the plausible story, shake the foundation of faith and let Wicken think that we have not figured out all the secrets, while retaining the core information and looking for opportunities to win over the scattered church personnel. Douglas said, "This issue is very important. Let's discuss it here and wait until we go back and hold the decision of the highest review group meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking room, three people Has already arrived at the forward base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magical array, Brooke, wearing a white hair set, pushed his gold-rimmed glasses and looked at the figure of the three, gently vomiting : "It’s good to come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey "The Prophet" Begner also smiled: "The two legendary peaks should not be so easy. It’s fallen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Universe, Natasha remains Doing hard work every day, leaving only a little time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pale justice" Jianguang flashed, an illusory crack appeared on the elemental planet, constantly spreading countless small traces to the side, which can The little planet that has been devastated by her seems to be unable to withstand it and will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, there is no air in the darkness, there is a crisp applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned her head in surprise and saw a young man wearing a black top hat in the deep starry sky. His handsome face was glowing. Smile easily: "There is no improvement in strength for a few months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, Natasha brows out: "Devil, pick me up Sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jian Guangyan came, Lu Xien was shocked, Natasha "fired into the magic"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not yet figured out that it is hard to pick up this sword, or to stun her, Jianguang suddenly converges, Natasha flies in front of him, a Lucy He hugged, his face was close, his breathing was slightly rapid, and his tone was full of joy: "It is a familiar taste!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still familiar formula? Lucien silently whispered a whisper, and she felt warm and happy about Natasha’s undisguised truth. She forced her with both hands and whispered: “Worried that I am in danger?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you are my husband, my lover, you are missing behind the soul fireplace, how can I not worry?" Natasha feels very good, no trace The land admits that the body is slightly behind, and the silver and purple eyes look at Lucien carefully. The smile is brilliant: "It looks like it is not hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No injuries, but also got a lot of good things.” Lucien smiled and took the initiative to kiss Natasha's lips. “There are no old springs, there are mummies, there are legendary eyes, there are substitute puppets, there are several curses. The hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien looked at the surrounding scene and said: "You are trying to temper and prepare for the advanced legend to save me? You haven’t promoted the epic yet. Is this time very weak and hates yourself? ?, It is no confidence "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; only Natasha, Lucien they are so jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed twice: "Is this kind of person? I can be confident and confident. If you disappear for another month, I will become an epic knight." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is playing "Destiny" in the Magic Tower?" Lucien debuted her "without mercy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s beautiful eyes dashed, and her hands moved up, holding Lucien’s head and giving him a long, deep kiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel my confidence?" The mouth separates, Natasha panted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also has some breathlessness, hehe smiled: "Feeling, there is such progress, you can promote the epic in a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, I should have hope to attack the legendary third-order, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien gently beheaded: "I fully support you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the head stretched out and spit in Natasha, smirking: "But you have to compensate me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the itchiness of the ear, remembering something "unbearable to look back", Natasha’s cheeks are once again difficult to contain Slightly reddish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Institute, Sprinter and other arcans are busy The respective experiments, suddenly, they heard the familiar voice with a smile: "Your diligence makes me very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, teacher? Heidi turned around and said happily: "Teacher, welcome back, we have accumulated a lot of questions and want to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of exploring the realm of the dead The matter was blocked very tightly. They didn't know the dangers of Lucien. They only thought that he was going out normally, so he was not particularly excited and excited to see him return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and looked at Heidi, and said to Annick and other students: "Is the original Heidi killed by the devil? Now it is the devil." Actually, I have to take the initiative to ask questions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the teacher you gave me and Cherie's research project has a breakthrough surname progress." Heidi proudly tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked the right eyebrow: "Analysis of the principle of auxiliary calculation magic array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes!" Heidi seems to be eager to show his results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sprint told Heidi: "When the teacher just came back, he must first report some important things to him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the important thing?" Lucien asked in confusion, Natasha didn't seem to mention it, but she had a hard time during this time and didn't know what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina smiled brilliantly: "Congratulations to the teacher, you got the first Evans Arcane Award, you and Mr. Dieppe because of the wave two The outstanding contributions of the surname and electron diffraction share this arcane medal. The name of the medal is 'second elephant surname'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said while The appearance of the Evans Arcane Award is presented with the magic of the scene. This medal, with the black end on the top, is set with a silver-white planet representing the macro world, and the lower end is silver-white, which depicts the black atomic symbols in the microscopic field. Strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basic shape of the Evans Arcane Medal designed by Lucien in the style of "Tai Chi", with the word "second elephant surname" written in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it an image? Who will help me with the award?" Lucien probably guessed that the Magic Council was meant to cover up things for himself and others, and deliberately made it in advance. Out of this award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lai Liya couldn’t help but smile at the thought: "It’s a small crystal to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are already familiar with the small crystal Aphrodite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It directly took back his own home, this is simply sending the sheep into the tiger's mouth... Lu Xien smiled and shook his head, not too concerned about the medal, But in order to constrain Aphrodite's greed, to create a sound dragon, it must be made clear when it will come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are reporting on the more important things happening in the parliament. The research results that are worthy of attention during this time, Holt School of Magic Operating conditions, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening, Lucien "cares" about Black, Lovi, Ophelia and other assistants, and finally walks into the conference room and holds a regular meeting - - After Annick and others became middle-level arcians and magicians, there was no need for the Lazar threes to always have to stay in the institute, so they agreed to complete the mandatory surname mission this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi is not in a hurry now, and is very embarrassed: "Teacher, Sprint and Annick gave a hypothesis about the anomalous line splitting phenomenon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
