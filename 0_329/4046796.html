			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the broadcast of "Sound of Mystery" in the past few days, both Banus and Ali clearly know that the "Lentart Festival" is scheduled every three years. The Golden Moon lasted for three days on the last week of Saturday, so they rushed to the Baroque Baron Square today to learn about the "Rentart Festival" from the "Sound of Mystery". In the news interviews and other shows, I heard indirectly the most touching and melodic part of the opera of Lord Evans. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they did not expect this to happen at all, watching the magician floating in the air, watching the darkness of the square gradually forming the "curtain" and complex precision The combination of silver and white patterns has not come back for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that silver-white line illuminates, it glows softly, and Banus and Ali are awake from the shock and are excited. Expecting and puzzled to stretch the neck and look ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Live? Is the studio of Today's Voice of Mystery at the Theatre of the Kingdom of Lentat?" Ali listened in the Voice of Mystery. The term "live" and its basic concepts can be ignorant of its true "look". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the term "studio" was learned from the pen pal's letter, and the weekly magazine had a special secret radio station and interviewed the famous anchor. The special issue, as the most prestigious Lace Weekly in the Magic Council, was not only loved by the Arcans, but also sought after by the curious magician's daily life and the Lentat citizens who had gonessip about the gossip, and gradually stepped out of Allinge. Going to the Lentat literacy class and heading to the major cities of the Holm Kingdom, the sales volume has surpassed the sum, and it is another alternative case for the magician to make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus did not understand the term "studio" before, but it was shocked by the "Lentart Kingdom Theatre", but the tone was very excited. Authentic: "Can we listen to it all the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Holm is a country of popular drama, oratorio and opera, even with the overall musical level and Aalto. There is a big gap, and these aspects are not inferior to any place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Pearl of the Sea" opposite Turtle Strait, the citizens generally believe that the drama that Holm Kingdom has spread is in the plot, content and ideology. Far better than other countries, the same is true of opera. . Say no words. Rantart's opera is indeed better than Alto. After all, in Aalto, the pure music is too dazzling, covering other aspects. Playwrights and singers are not comparable to Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. Even ordinary citizens. Banus also has an unusual love for drama and opera, and has long been eager for the "Lentart Kingdom Theatre", known as the theatre and opera sanctuary. Due to the limitations of his own economic conditions and the lack of small town opera singers, he and Ali have spent most of their time watching drama. Only when they meet the baron birthday, the small city establishment day, etc., can they spend their savings and listen to an opera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If 'live' is really the meaning of the 'voice of mystery', then we are sure to hear today, good-looking novels!!" Ali is very excited . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the length of the "Sound of Mystery", it usually replays several classic tracks at the most, and it is impossible to completely release the entire opera, and the Baron of the Small Town can The invited opera singer must be very general. Maybe there is no one who can call it a singer. So even if you can't see the singers who have been admired for a long time, you can enjoy this kind of first time. The top-level opera is also a matter of gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best musicians, the best singers and opera singers, the best theaters, I can’t think of myself and other civilians to enjoy the enjoyment of a noble aristocrat. luxurious"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus excitedly held his hand: "Hey, we are also a nobleman! But what is the curtain? Direct broadcast is not enough." Anyway, it’s the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Should it be a wall? Well, maybe to enhance the effect, in the previous Voice of Mystery, Miss Nightingale It is often said that due to signal problems, some listeners may have different levels of noise..." Ali racked his brains to find a reasonable explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus slammed his hands: "Yes, how have I forgotten this thing, Ali, you really have a good brain."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali proudly raised his chin and told you long ago that I am smarter than you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-level magician floating in the air completed the final debugging, and the eccentric sound of the aria was heard in the mouth. A star in the sky suddenly lit up and sprinkled a brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Banus opened his mouth again, can the magician command the stars in the sky? Is this not the authority of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dreamy and shocking scene, the black "curtain" is dyed with a pure and innocent light, and the stars of the sky complement each other, with the stars next to it. "Flying" together creates a beautiful picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the sky stars is no longer so bright, it returns to normal, tends to be stable, and the black "curtain" seems to be transparent, and there is actually silver inside. The moonlight slowly illuminates and dispels the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentle and serene melody floats out, and the beautiful is like a clear lake shining in the moonlight, letting the soul calm down and bring it A touch of sweetness, tranquility and sorrow, both gloomy and calm, and calm and bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus and Ali are all intoxicated, indulge in the slowly shining silver moon, indulge in the elusive fantasy melody, the square be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are no strangers to this most beautiful piano sonata, not only the style of the restaurant will hire a musician to play, so that people passing by can also be blurred, "Mystery The Voice of the Voice is often thought of as the background music of the column. However, this time the performance level exceeds any one they have heard before, so that they really appreciate the most beautiful side of the music, plus the scenes. How can they not be intoxicated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold moonlight is getting brighter, and a white piano is slowly highlighted in the darkness behind the curtain, and next to the piano, side to Banus, etc. The man is a woman with long hair until the waist. She wears a black evening gown, and her white shoulders reveal a large part. The side is quiet and soft, and the facial features are delicate and delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moonlight" sprinkled on the woman, making her seem to be covered with a layer of silver gauze, and her long, spiritual hands in the bright light Jumping constantly. Dancing. "Create" the most beautiful music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So beautiful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good moving..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, Banus and Ali have been completely attracted, except for similar thoughts, there is no other sigh in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of atmosphere and scene. The appearance of five or six points can also be very shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence, other book friends are watching: The quieter first movement draws a rest. The lady turned her head and let her see her pleasing and serene face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome to the ‘Mystery Voice’, I am your old friend’s nightingale.” Sweet and moving, familiar and intimate voice came from the lady’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night. Miss Nightingale?" Banus stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, real people?" Ali 520 novels came out, this is magic, just the curtain, wrong, the wall, how it became a living person, Can play! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people who witnessed this scene in the square are in a similar "quiet" state, including the middle-level magician floating in the air, and almost forgot He also flew in the air. Although he knew and participated in the “live broadcast plan” of the parliament, such an opening still made him feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am as surprised as everyone else. The video signal transmission of the parliament is matched with the artificial planet to achieve this level. This should be the first time in history. 'Full live broadcast', still listening to the 'Mystery Voice' friends at home, don't feel my words strange, you hurry to the nearby square to watch, in fact, I have already forecasted last night..." Louise sweet voice 娓The rumor came to solve the doubts of the "audiences." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full live broadcast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can see where we are in Samara Miss Allinge’s Nightingale?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
