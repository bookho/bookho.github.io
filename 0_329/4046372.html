			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weekend? So fast?" After hearing Florentha’s seemingly lazy voice after electromagnetic communication, Lucien was quite strange, Lord Morris’s jealousy, will he make the ring so fast? It’s only two days away from the weekend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge is not like the holy city of Aalto, the weekend is generally referred to as Sunday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensha seems to squint and smiled: "This time you are almost 'turned away' in the will of the element, the teacher feels lost face, so speed up The progress of the ring making."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pause, her laugh stopped and became a bit serious: "At least, you wear three Holm crown rings After wearing the 'Immortal Throne' robes, there is a certain life-saving possibility for the high-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Lucien is even more strange. The high-level elements of the will must not know that they have already recognized the initial realization of the world, and can use high-order items three times in a row. Then, where do they have the confidence to keep their lives against high-ranking magicians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa giggled: "The constant magic is very good, the teacher has no material, the magic of the two rings is great, so, finished He regrets, hey, even wants to cancel the awards banquet, saving this insignificant money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the style of Lord Morris. Lucien asked with great expectation: "Ms. Florencia, what are the two seven-ring magics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔, Confidential, etc. When you get it, you will be clear.” Florenza smiled and teased Lucien. “Keeping curiosity and expectation is the secret of youthfulness.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Zizz, electromagnetic communication interrupted, leaving Lu Xien helplessly flip through the books of "Star and Elemental Book" and "High-level Magic Encyclopedia", guessing their own two rings, a magic robe, Will each have a constant magic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduced Aphrodite is on the sofa, relishing his salary this month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Glorious Cathedral, a retreat interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker of the House of Lords, "The King of the Lions" Duke Rex is meeting with Cardinal Philippe Bell, referee giant Baha'u'llah and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex, I understand what you mean, and I agree with this idea, I will report it to the Holy City." Philip Bell could not see the face. Anger, only a little tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Holm, and in three other countries, the strength of the church is at a complete disadvantage. After all, the Magic Council is concentrated in a few cities, legendary Most of the magicians are in Aringe, and the church is strong. If you want to recruit, you have to worry about other forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Knights of the Knights of the Grail, who has always been very keen to fight, is also very calm at this time: "We can rest assured that we can know the attitude of the nobles. I hope that when the opportunity arises, you can cooperate. We will try to calm down this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to fight when the Magic Council is ready Well, Shi Dong is not a fool. He has to pick the hardest way to go, and wait for the opportunity to win over the nobility. It is not a retreat and does not violate his knight's creed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baha'u'llah and Warren Hill are not satisfied, but use this time in exchange for Holm, Calais, Burrian and other countries The change in the attitude of the nobility is also worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the news I know, James, Russell and other nobles are more inclined to the Magic Council. Do you know what Rex has?" The problem of internal division of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex just nodded hard and solemnly: "The so-called enlightened aristocrats who favor the Magic Council are actually very few, only about 10% of the kingdom's aristocracy. Half of the aristocratic powers that favor the church are less than half, and most of the remaining nobles are neutral, but they do not exclude the church. If they can meet their interests and create a situation that cannot be swayed by them, they will fall completely to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex, you forgot, most of the nobles are in line with the lord, and you are not the king of Holm, nor the heir to the throne." The Holy Knight knows more about the aristocracy's mentality. If the interests do not reach the point where the nobles lose their senses, they will definitely "unify around the lord." The stupid aristocrats understand that once the loyalty to the lord is arbitrarily stepped on the ground, they will only be able to fall apart and rely on the help of the church to rule the system and lose the status of reading power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermitty is already old, and the level of his knight is not high. In a few years, he may be called by the Lord. Are you sure you can find an opportunity in a few years?" Philip Bell shook his head slightly, as a long-term help. The clerics treated by Tis, he knows very well about the physical condition of Fertis, knowing that he is old and can't live for a few years. This is a trend that the magic can't be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex is gloomy and does not deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillie Bell looked at other people, and his tone was flat and continued to say: "And Prince Patrick is too biased towards the Magic Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Prince Patrick is too biased towards the Magic Council." Rex repeated it in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At 8:00 on Sunday night, the element will be the Allinge branch, with bright lights and staggering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this time Morris's mood will be bad for a long time, there is no particularly important thing, it is best not to find him." Gaston Carrying a glass of wine, screaming at the "strong smile" to entertain Morris of other high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of several Arcane Review Committees naturally gathered together, surrounded by their students, friends, such as Larry, Yurissie, K And the magician of Lazar and the Lucien Atomic Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and smiled: "After the opening of the micro-world, the important contribution of the elemental field worthy of history may be indispensable, and Morris must adapt to this in advance. The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Morris's voice suddenly emerged from behind the crowd, with a thick bite in his tone. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the sociable high-level buddies waited for a circle of guests to come back, just heard the words of Lucien, just like being shot by Lee In the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is a new field, this is an area involving deep mysteries of matter." Lucien seems to have not mentioned Morris's "hate" "Frankly, like the members," I suggested that the Holm Crown Award be changed to be issued once a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it issued once a year? Absolutely not!” Morris’ voice was slightly higher and his expression was “serious”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa smiled at Lucian, not understanding why he was stimulating his teacher, and other elements would be equally funny and strangely looked over. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled carelessly: "If there is no merit worth giving the Holm Crown Award in a year, it will be directly vacant, if there are several , only one item is issued a year, so that you can avoid the pain of issuing a few rings at a time, and it is best to issue them at a fixed time, so that the parliamentary magicians are full of expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good way!" Morris "strongly agrees." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that this only delays the number of years the ring is issued, and does not fundamentally reduce the loss of the warehouse." Seeing his teacher smile, Florencia Can't help but hit him, while smiling at Lucian, what exactly do he want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t believe that Lucien would have no idea to make a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his glass and smiled: "No matter whether it is material or money, there will be no growth in the warehouse, but if it is used for investment What is the money-making project? A Holm crown ring is postponed for one year, what is the return on the annuity that can be received? Anyway, it is someone else's, so why not earn some annuity income? A pool of stagnant water can only slowly decay The flowing spring will only be clear for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Morris and others are not fools. When it comes to this point, why not? Understand the idea of ​​Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I talked with Mr. Arthur Doyle of Holm Mining United Bank, his electricity from the use of water flow conversion Very interested, such as the magic crystal lamp to reduce materials and requirements, promoted to the nobility, such as transforming the magic of remaining sound into alchemy items, such as extensive construction of magic towers or other means, the level of electromagnetic communication is greatly reduced, I When it comes to thinking, it is an alchemy item that is very suitable for popularization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
