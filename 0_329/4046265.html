			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm style, afternoon sun and sorrow, bring people lazy sleepiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dress up for Lucien, who was led by Leo to the hidden house of Valentin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovering the strength of Leo shows his good camouflage skills, not only let Lucien turn the Holm style black double-breasted long dress into a typical sand Helan-style brown-red tight-fitting jacket, white tight-fitting breeches and black boots, and the hair is smeared with oil on the back, and the foundation is shaded to set off the lower nose. The make-up method makes Lucien look mature. With his beard, the whole person is like a twenty-seven-year-old calm and majestic gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East Exiles gathered a lot of guys who fled from the Shahran Empire, so this dress is not eye-catching, Lucian and Leo take the opportunity to walk with vigilance In the crowd, to prevent being tracked, after all, it is no secret that the Duke of Vladimir sent assassins to try to assassinate Valentin, and if they were found to be in contact with Valentin, it is easy to associate with the fake identity. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no small, there is half a lot of Alto, but the building is unplanned and free to build, so the streets are narrow and crowded and chaotic. In this kind of environment, Leo is like a fish, and it is very adaptable to take Lu Xien with the help of pedestrians and houses, and continuously change direction and street to get rid of any possible tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Lucien and Leo, who came out of a quiet, cold alley, returned to the most prosperous crossroads of Tez Valley and walked into A grocery store...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the surprise of the grocery store owner, Leo went straight to the stairs, and suddenly stood up in the shadows with two faces like a butcher. Dahan blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Griffin over the Negening River." Leo whispered a strange word in the Shahran Empire language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words were heard, the two great men relaxed their guards and looked at them carefully, indicating that Leo and Lucien could go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the narrow, swaying stairs to the second floor, Lucien immediately sensed that there was a dangerous magic array around them that seemed to be deliberately exposed. Those who are shocked to find it here, as to whether they still hide other hidden magic arrays in the dark, must be carefully examined before they can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a nobleman who can compete with the contemporary Duke of Vladimir for inheritance, even if he flees to the East, but can also arrange such a big hand." Well, the strength of the magic array here is equivalent to the Bertrand Castle, at least tens of thousands of Quintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Valentin fled, he seemed to have enough wealth and had a certain strength to guard them, so he could come to the middle magician. Arranged here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoes are stepping on the floor that seems to be in disrepair, and the sound of squeaking sounds, only Lucien and Leo walk side by side in the cold and quiet aisle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly walked outside a house in the middle of the second floor, and Leo knocked on the door reverently: "Mr. Valentin, I am Leo. I brought you a business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in." Valentin, who has long confirmed the identity of Leo through the magic array, has a flat tone. Answer, the voice is old and exhausted, with a strong bitter feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo like the housekeeper pushed the door open and reached out and said: "Mr. X, please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien smiles and walks, seeing the opposite window is covered by thick black curtains, only a small amount of light is transmitted in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This puts the whole house in a dark and dark place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the shadow in front of the curtain, there was a desk and a chair, and there was a man in a black night dress sitting against Lucien and Leo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Leo walks in and gently covers the door, the man in the shadow turns the chair and looks at the two faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His golden hair began to be dull and sparse, with a well-defined silhouette, stiff and rough, and obviously with aging. Although he could not see his exact age, Lucien judged at least sixty or more, because according to Leo’s description, when he fled to the east exile, Valentin was a four-level knight. After two or three decades. After the crouching, no one knows whether the strength is improving or stagnating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, in the shadows, he walked out of a well-dressed, well-behaved old man. He politely bowed slightly, and then went to the next tea room to prepare black tea for Lucian and Leo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo as a guide and temporary steward of Lucien, he replied: "Mr. Valentin, my employer wants to enter the Shahran Empire, so Need a fake identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to pretend to be a Vladimir family?" Valentin is not an idiot, forging his identity and finding himself, then It may only be related to the Vladimir family, otherwise the ordinary citizenship, etc., has a professional counterfeiter in the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said this, Valentin’s eyes became sharp, as if he could see through the people like Lucien, so Lucien had to open his own eyes. "Yes, Mr. Valentin, I need the identity of a member of the Vladimir family, which will help me pass the checkpoints and fortresses and avoid a lot of unnecessary troubles. How much money do I need to pay? Do you agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a few seconds, Valentin suddenly laughed: "If you have the strength to help me get rid of Ilyich, then I have a copper coin I won't accept you. But if you have this level of strength, there is no need to come to me to create fake identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ily is this generation The name of Grand Duke of Rakimir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a moment, Valentin took out a cigar from the drawer and lit a match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the grayish white smoke slowly, and slowly said: "The more this fake identity is done, the easier it is to be discovered, so these two For more than a decade, I have only done six copies. The price is very expensive. I need 500 Jintal or equivalent Shahran gold coins. If you can't get so much money, you can consider doing one thing for me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I can apply for compensation after returning to the Magic Council for a large expenditure on the mission, Lucien is only equivalent to one hundred Quintals. Gold, gems, etc., have long been replaced with magic potions, materials, magician cabins and utensils in the alchemy cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weighed for a while, Lucien Wenwen smiled and said: "I chose to pay for it, but I don’t have that much. I don’t know if Mr. Valentin can’t accept it. Magic items?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the things of Valentin are even simple, there may be hidden dangers of involvement in his fight with Vladimir’s Grand Duke, so if it’s not true There is no way, Lucien will never choose to work for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity.” Valentin’s tone is not shocking. “Mr. X, you can pay for magic items. I’m here to assess the fairness and exile in the whole east. The land is one of the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magic item can effectively enhance the strength of the knight and the magician, for the Valentin who needs to strengthen his strength to protect himself. This is much better than paying directly. After all, in addition to the Magic Council headquarters, in most places, magic items are priceless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien came out from Longsang? Aaron's debilitating dagger: "This is a second-class magic weapon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Valentin’s gentle cough, from the other side of the shadow Walking out of an old-fashioned eagle with an ancient magical empire style robes, he first looked at Lucien with a cold eyes, then grabbed his right hand and let the dagger fly into his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient inheritance of the magician..." Lucien judged from the changes in the spiritual field produced by his magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-haired old man after the appraisal said: "The second-order middle-order enchanted dagger can corrode other people's weapons, and the wounds that are scratched by it are difficult to heal, spirit Force, physical strength, and vitality flow together and quickly weaken. Because there is no excessive use requirement, the estimate of 380 Genthals, but given the scarcity of magical items, the total of 420 Gentale I can buy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I calculate according to 380 Genthal, Mr. X will definitely look for another buyer and change it to gold. Come to me, so I will evaluate it according to the four hundred and twenty Jintales." Wa Lianjing said straightforwardly. It didn't start the magical murder of Lucien's thoughts. This money can't make him desperate. If the person who started the magical array was discovered by the Duke of Vladimir, the loss would be ten times and twenty times. In four hundred and twenty Jintala! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
