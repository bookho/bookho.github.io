			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility, in the study of Viscount Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Klein was tied to the backrest, the neat black hair was scattered, and the green eyes were fixed on the man in front of the funny clown mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown who knows the Sage Master very well, with the strength of five levels, under the raid is easy to hold the Viscount Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the clown that the princess said? It’s crazy, I dare to attack me!" Ark City Council, the governor, Klein, was angry and a little scared. Scolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown laughs at the sky: "The Viscount, you don't tell me that the magic you used just was inspired by the article. I arrested an evil according to the provisions of the Holy Scriptures." What's wrong with the magician, or do you want me to call you Mr. Sage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the prince Klein disguised, horrified: "You How..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half, he hurriedly stopped, seemingly worried that the clown was swindling himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Viscount, you have mastered your situation, but have never arrested you. This is mainly to see if you will regret, after all, you are a A noble aristocrat, but you have not. But you have a last chance, as long as you tell me the whereabouts of the professor, you can continue to retain the identity of the nobility and the status of the consul, just need to secretly join the team of night watchmen." Looking out the window, I was worried that the "real" vigils would come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Klein was stunned and then sneered: "It was originally for the purpose of arresting the professor. It is dangerous to communicate with the characters in this purification sequence, but I am not Believe in you, you have been removed from the night watchman team and are dangerous fugitives. I will wait until the real night watchman comes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His performance is like the clown expects, There is no limit and persistence to keep secrets. It is as proud and sleek as most nobles. If the interests are sufficient, you can even cooperate with the devil! So he knows that his identity has been exposed and arrested, and he will be more competitive than other magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his current ridicule is obviously to fight for better conditions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown’s exaggerated smile came to the front of the Viscount Klein and snorted: “The idea is good, but you met me, and I am very anxious, afraid to delay Aroused the vigilance of the professor, so I am wronged, the Viscount Klein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Klein’s face changed dramatically, the clown’s fingers began to bounce and let Klein's muscles followed by convulsions, eyes, mouth, etc. under the command of the clown opened and closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the "Sage" Klein's eyes began to appear turbid, it seems that not only the body was indulged, but even the brain and soul were controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with other knights of the Cavaliers, the clown can ask for real intelligence even without magical techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your codename? Is it a formal magician? What is it?" The clown first adjusted the effect with simple questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s eyes recovered from the turbidity, and it looked no different from before, but it smiled uncharacterally: “Returning to the clown, I am a formal magician, codename The sage, who is good at the astral system. Because he could not activate the blood power, and there was no formula, and the status was not given by the Grand Duke, he found some books secretly collected by the ancestors after killing the magician and began to learn, trying to restore the excitement. The formula of the blood power, and found that he has the characteristics of the astral system, so it gets deeper and deeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming the effect, the clown did not ask Klein himself. The question, straightforwardly said: "How did you meet the professor this time? How to contact him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the clown adults, I was at the concert night After returning, he was found by the professor. He used the four-ring magic 'mirror development' to talk to me remotely and asked to attend the last magic circle party to tell them the news of the Magic Council headquarters. En did not conceal and replied, "When I promised, we have seen it once in private. It is an uninhabited garden villa at No. 116 in Jisu District. The contact mark is... but I don't know where his real hiding place is. His pre-determined location."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the flash of his mind flashed, "No. 116 in Jisu District? Isn't it the place where Lucien? Evans lived before? It is a remote environment, and it has not been rented yet. Only one old servant looks at it, very suitable. Hiding! With the secret relationship between Professor and Lucien, he is likely to hide there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown only feels blood boiling, excited and shuddering because of himself It is very likely that the professor’s hiding place has been discovered. Wouldn’t he have thoroughly investigated Lucien? Evans, without letting go of any details, no one thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was afraid of being taught, forced himself to calm down and analyze whether there were traps and conspiracy: "Lu Xien? Evans is raising a disease in a villa in the noble area, Natasha is said to be dealing with the affairs of the Principality today. She has not left the Lata Summer Palace. If they suddenly appear at No. 116 in Jisu District, anyone with eyes can see that it is a conspiracy against me and the night watchman. After all, I have not sneaked in. The home of Lucien Evans, they did not have a reason to appear there in the middle of the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Designing me and other strong fires? Impossible, This is the city of Aalto, not the Melzer Black Forest. As long as I have a level of confrontation, I will soon be alerted to the high-ranking powerhouses, and follow-up Juliana will also come with the team of the night watchman and the referee. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The clown knows that the best way is to wait for Juliana to do it, but the flame in his heart is burning, he is being shackled, asked The grief of execution, watching the anger of his companion’s death, let him Personally seize the professor, but he also has a certain degree of confidence in their own strength, after all, he had been in contact with the professor, have first-hand information, not relying purification sequence on the strength of his terror judge people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful analysis, I saw Juliana again. They were worried that their actions against Klein would arouse the professor’s vigilance. The clown quickly decided: "I will go there carefully to investigate, step by step and carefully investigate." See if there is a hidden and ambush magic array. If you can find a professor, then entangle him, causing the sense of Aalto's magical array, let The high-ranking powers noticed that if they could not find it, or if the villa was too strange, they would hide and hand it over to the vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own ability to seal the spirit of the Viscount Klein, the clown took a pen and paper on the desk and wrote the news he had explored. It is to avoid the night watchman who came after him to ask Klein and delay the time. At that time, he only needs to confirm from Klein's mouth according to what he wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, the clown left the nobility and arrived at No. 116, Jisu District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire garden villa is shrouded in dark shadows, like a lurking monster, making people feel heart-wrenching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown carefully and carefully examined the surrounding of the garden villa and found that there were no traces of the magic array, so he became more and more daring, dragging the residual image into the But all the way, he did not forget to check the surroundings, preferring to slow down and not want to step into the professor's trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa is empty and no one is going to sleep in the dark, while the clown is hiding in the dark, while carefully caring for a house and a house Check to try to find clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the basement and the first floor were checked, and the clown moved to the second floor more cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The home of Viscount Klein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wauritt Referee "Visitor" Valdo led a small team of night watchers quietly to the second floor, trying to find and control the Viscount Klein. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not go to the door to arrest, fearing that the surrounding aristocrats in the villa would be aware of it, thus leaking news and letting the professor escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping on the second floor, Valdor’s nose with a brown beard covering his entire face suddenly twitched slightly, then he calmly said: “I smell it. The taste of blood feels the breath of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Valdo is a problem with Viscount Klein, or he killed the insider. ?" Juliana is worried that the clown is not able to control the madness factor in her dark blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waldo is tall and tall, and walked to the door of the study in two or three steps, solemnly saying: "There is only one dead person, and it is the blood taste of the millstone family."
