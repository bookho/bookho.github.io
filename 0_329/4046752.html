			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illusory and deep wound traversed the abdomen of the "Devil Prince", tearing and cutting its scales, "muscles" and bones, causing a lot of black corrosive blood Dropping out, let the inside squirming like a little devil's internal organs appear in front of Lucien and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Devil Prince" broke out with a scream that shook the entire plane, his mouth suddenly opened, his stomach squirmed, and he spit out a human form that was completely wrapped by mucus. The head of the devil has a unique double horn, and the legendary horror of the horror is filled with pressure. It is only that there is no substantial breath, so that the "blood color plain" splits one after another to see the gap of the molten flame river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still has this form? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain degree of damage to the real body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, everything is a little late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing yang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucian extending his left hand, "Devil Prince "The abdomen's wound suddenly burst into a burning glow to an unimaginable light, like at the same time, there are 10,000 suns coming here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion in the distance can't help but close his eyes under the protection of the "Green Stick", otherwise he suspects that he does not have extra natural gods. The eyes of the defensive defense will be smashed directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha holds the "Shield of Truth", her eyes drop and block the line of sight. Without the gap in the abyss, she is also afraid to As the "eternal blazing yang" casts the glare of the moment, it shines to the ultimate light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint vain ripple spreads from the "Shield of Truth", completely separating her from the real world, as if it is in other time and space, beyond the hood, unable to Time and space of touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody king's face goat's head, in the case of losing most of the magical items and effects, spit out a snake-like scarlet tongue, and two Together with the giant sword, it blocks the invasion of the silver-gray sword. When the "Devil Prince" controls the blood-colored plain, so that it can't get the bite feedback and blessing, its tongue and the giant sword split a little, and the illusory gap begins. Spread to its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot, come out!" In the heart, it roared with another head of his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog's head just had to cast a spell-like ability, and suddenly found the glare flashing, so he subconsciously looked at his "collar", suddenly, it was so bright and bright The horror of the thorns stabbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My eyes!" The dog's head screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, it feels endless pure light with extreme horrible heats, drowning everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire abdomen of the "Devil Prince" is directly vaporized, the light of the explosion The ultra-high temperature that is enough to melt everything engulfs the human form covered by mucus, engulfs its tail and engulfs its head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is like a rising sun, dispelling the darkness, obscuring the original dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I don’t know how many volcanic eruptions began to plunder, destroying all the blocked things, the “forest” was destroyed, “the natural altar "Destroyed, Stonehenge was destroyed, and the "Flesh Castle" in the distance seemed to have suffered a terrible earthquake and began to collapse and collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot energy storm not only destroys everything on the plains, but melts everything nearby, igniting all the things that can be lit on the broad plains around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demon was torn into pieces, and a piece of corpse burned a flame of various colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the light, the roaring explosion sounded like a thunderstorm, and the entire "Blood Plain" plane began to violently oscillate, seemingly in the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the huge white cloud ring formed by the airflow, Malfurion thoroughly understood why the magic of "eternal blaze" was called the purest violent magic by the parliament. Natasha thought with admiration, I don't know. When can your own destructive power reach this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, ticking, a piece of body with a black scales mixed in the black blood falling down in the rain, but without the regeneration of the demon king’s horror Ability, like the complete loss of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the monocle and looked at the mushroom cloud nearby, only to see the "Devil Prince" a few kilometers long and huge body has been fragmented, but at the core At the place, there is a dark hole that reveals the feeling of evil and chaos. It is faint to see that there is a water surface that is constantly bubbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black of the "big hole" fades, the scene inside is clear and clear, this is a green ocean, slamming white bubbles, there are on the sea A piece of reef and small island can be slowly disintegrated and melted under the dual action of the “ocean” and the faint and creeping red space around it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Abyss stomach bag'... 'The sea of ​​strong acid'..." These two names that Lu Xien whispered are exactly this abyss The title, the real home of the "Devil Prince", is close to the gods when fighting inside. "It seems that the blow didn't kill it completely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Lucian is not sorry, after all, he has only the legendary third-order, and did not prepare materials in advance, and here is the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Abyss stomach bag" is constantly bubbling with white bubbles, and there is a dark and gloomy castle underneath. It is the palace of the "Devil Prince". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubbles on the surface of the sea are getting more and more intense, and suddenly a sly face is highlighted. It looks at Lucien through the staggered two planes that have not disappeared. The ever-changing color of the eye with the bitter hatred:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" mortal, you will pay the price!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its voice with obvious weakness, this is an unquestionable performance - by the "natural arrow", and by the "eternal blaze" directly in the body, it is almost completely Fallen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even if it finally escapes, it has to abandon the subject and re-grow by the "devil core" pre-arranged in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the "Devil Prince" voice just fell, Lucien’s eyes suddenly widened, because there was a black inside the castle The shadow of Shen, wrapped it in the thunder of lightning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black shadow is like a "cannibal flower" that is digesting food, constantly squirming, twisting, expanding, and contracting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gornheim, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill you..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's voice of "Devil's Prince" is constantly coming from the black shadow, but it is getting weaker and weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gornheim? Dark Lord?" Malfurion seemed to understand what he heard after hearing the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha see each other, even if they can't guess the elves of the Elves, they can understand what Gonheim is doing now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is elevating in the best way of demonic evolution, it is engulfing the "Devil Prince", it is enjoying the abyss! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lucien took a step, prepared to stop, and changed any demon to become the legendary "Devil Prince", he does not care, anyway, no difference But the "Dark Lord" and "The Lord of Undead" are the worst choices, because they are like the devil, have the ability to restrain their own chaos and kill the surname, and can formulate complex conspiracy and implement it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubbles on the "strong acid sea" suddenly increased, as if it had been boiled at a high temperature. The creeping red space around it solidified, and a dark, cold, wide ice field was connected to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the ice sheet, there is a tall, dark castle with frozen traces everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle became illusory, revealing a black throne, the throne facing away from Lucien and others, faintly able to see a tall figure sitting on it . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the plains of the blood, the sea of ​​boiling, the wasteland of the tibia, the castle of hypocrisy, and the sky of the plane are suddenly dimmed, the sun disappears, the darkness emerges, and a drop of rain drops down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss is full of shouts full of killing desires, like the melody written in the Dark Proverb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demon below the king is on the ground, even if it is the "Lord of the Undead," the same kind of strange spirits created by Apsis . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Abyss Will" is expressing his joy, the joy of betrayal and killing, and engulfing chaos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hidden cave, the magic array has disappeared, and the projection of the Elf Queen has Disappeared, Lanhill has also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Dark Statue" was penetrated by the "Arrow of Nature", Ferragad quickly took the upper hand in the battle with the "Devil Projection" in the body. He was quickly ruled out and began to heal the injury. I don't know why, he suddenly remembered a conversation between Her Majesty the Queen and Lanhill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why my plan will fail, why is it known to you..." Before the conversion, Lanhill still asked indecently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves Queen Agleia sighed softly: "The demon prince has never been able to formulate and enforce a strong plan, where is your conspiracy?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Black, the dark Lord betrayed the demon prince, is it not afraid of being killed by the wrathful demon prince leading other demon kings?" Lan Hill seems to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrea shook his head: "I said, this is the world of great contention, the legendary peaks must compete for the road of the gods, other legends must also For the promotion of the peak adventure, this is the most dangerous but the best opportunity for Gonheim. This time, it is not that it is dead, that is, the demon prince is swallowed by it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps the fall of a legendary peak can truly symbolize the arrival of a world of great controversy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand retracts his thoughts and thinks Dao: "Although Her Majesty has completed the state transition, there is still a long way to go from the level of the gods... I hope she will succeed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sea of ​​strong acid" became cold, and a thin layer of ice crystals was formed, and the ice sheets outside the "ice fortress" also emerged. A strong acid river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two planes overlap in this way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep darkness is filled under the throne, the horrible atmosphere suddenly erupts, the legendary first-order, the legendary second-order, the legendary third-order, has rushed to the legendary peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice of the "Shen of the Darkness", the throne turned over and sat on a handsome young man wearing a black tuxedo and staying With long hair like ice crystals, the skin is darker, and it seems to be no different from humans except that the forehead has a pair of small black devil horns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its eyelids are first dark, then change into a variety of alternating colors, gold, scarlet, green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Lord" Gonheim looked at Lucien, Natasha, and Malfurion with such eyes, looking at the broken natural altar Then, he got up from the throne, his mouth was filled with a playful smile, his right hand pressed his chest, and he said slightly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
