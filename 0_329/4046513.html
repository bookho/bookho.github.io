Evans?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nattasha, Camille, Purchasing Fire, and other people who besieged Annatans also noticed the changes here. Some people were pleasantly surprised, some were stunned, but they faced one The golden knight is under great pressure, and the thoughts in his heart just have to flash and he has to continue to devote himself to the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis did not recognize Lucien’s identity for a while, because from his gesture of holding Axin, it seemed to be a mysterious and powerful knight. The first time he was thinking about the main material world, the Knights or the Golden Knights were able to compete with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of implied death and resurrection of the surname of the gods shine into the left hand, Lucien clearly felt the slow recovery of Etna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of God’s surname that is related to this is absorbed, and the remaining “incarnation of love and beauty” and “star of dawn and twilight” begin to When Axin was dissipated, Lucien found that Etna interrupted the absorption, so the left hand gently pushed out Axin, so as not to conflict with his cognitive world, and most importantly, absorbed this. Part of the surname of God, it is likely to become a female surname directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axin’s head is filled with paper, completely unaware of what happened. When the mysterious black man squeezed his throat, he thought This time it was completely degraded, but why did he just absorb a part of the surname of God and he let go of himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really picky eaters..." Lucien’s mind turned this idea altogether, and then sent a message to Natasha using the wind. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, El has recovered from the stunned, seeing the prey that he has been searching for is being robbed in advance, anger and greed are emerging at the same time, double The eyes are round, with a high and indifferent voice: "I command you, death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river around Lucian is tumbling and the vitality is quickly lost, but he The body has not changed at all, and the strange and difficult law of the law seems to be completely ineffective in front of his extended left hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" El couldn’t believe that he had stepped back. He had never encountered such a situation since he was able to use the law. Regardless of whether it will be affected by the law, at least the subject will change accordingly, and then it will be able to resist. As it is this time, it seems that he has never used the law to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In His Eyes, Lucien in the river is quiet as it was just now, and the depth is inexplicably like the devil in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the devil in his eyes moved, and Lucien’s moonlight shone, muscles smashed, and suddenly flew out of the river, his left hand grabbed himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not a person who only complains about lamenting, since he has already revealed his whereabouts, facing the one-eyed Anantan, and may be lurking in The legendary magician nearby, it is useless to escape, so do not seize the opportunity to absorb the name of the god in the fields of silver moon, immortality, resurrection, etc., let Aitna restore strength to the greatest extent, is it to restore and die? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it’s not that Etna’s “Hunger” led Lucien’s shot, but Lucien actively turned into a Knight of the Sky and attacked El. He is the false god in charge of the resurrection, immortality, moonlight, redemption, and destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge, high-spirited will emanates from Lucien’s left hand, making El thinking become stagnant, as if he had encountered a natural nemesis, standing there. Unable to respond effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! The madman who was influenced by the surname of God!" When seeing El rushing to the mysterious knight in the river, Francis couldn’t help but snorted. Hesitant to decide whether to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you see Lucien, he has a decision, just a six-level Knight! It should be that his blood is special, and he can restrain the surname and the genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands clasping the giant sword, Francis stayed high and squatted, and suddenly, the ground seemed to have a vortex that absorbed all the mist in the air and destroyed it. The fan atomization became a nine-headed black snake circling down, with lightning, toxins, acid and other forces, slamming to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary left hand was hit on the black fog, and the slamming sound was screaming, the smoke disappeared, and the silver moon hangs in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis holds the huge sword at the crack, heavy landing, and lingering back, the eyes are all incredible colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s arched force exerted the speed of the moonlight, and rushed to the front of Francis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hurry, Francis can only sweep the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien backed a squat, his body was short, he escaped the giant sword, his left hand clenched his fist and slammed it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that it is difficult to avoid, Francis body twisted and squirmed, black mist swelled up and wanted to dispel the damage with atomization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! The left fist slammed on the chest of Francis, and his black mist suddenly condensed into flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the sound of the broken ribs sounded one after another, and Francis’s blood spurted in the mouth, flew out and fell heavily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is broken, the internal organs are ruptured, and the front is full of bloody fog. Francis only feels that it is very difficult to move a finger. It is comparable to physical damage. His fear and horror on the left hand is clearer. What kind of power is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that in just a few seconds, Francis fell into the dust like a rag pocket, and El’s heart was full of fear and fear, but also Thanks to Francis blocking, he finally got rid of the kind of suppression and solidification, and he was escaping from the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, an elegant and slender left hand appeared in front of his eyes, which seemed to reflect a faint radiance, then clasped his fingers, clenched his fists and hit himself Face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" The fear from the heart made El's inability to maintain an inscrutable temperament, the face was distorted, and a kind of magicalism came out. Some are released by themselves, some are automatically inspired by the magical items. They have the same force field as the transparent wall, the flame-like shield, the tranquility, the darkness of sleep, the countless deaths, the whirlwinds . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left fist did not recycle, still forcefully hit, with the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the left fist hit the magical defense around El, the time seems to have a short stagnation. Then, the face of the grievance disappeared peacefully, the gray death quickly faded, and then, the darkness rolled, the flames flew, and the transparent force field was broken, which was like the wall of a layer of paper paste that El was posing in front of him. A hole in the hole, hitting his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" El's painful screams were earth-shattering, and then blocked back into his mouth, his nose and mouth fell directly, his entire face was recessed into his head, blood Bursts to the left and right, a touch of milky white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s fist stretched out and changed to catch it, pinching the rotten watermelon-like head of El, who was a false god and suffered such a blow. After that, I have not died yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, El’s body is blurred, and it’s detached from Lucien’s hand, floating in the shadow of the mountain wall a dozen meters away, softly falling on the ground, difficult Maintain life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly swayed, this is not El's own efforts, but someone saved him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antanas looked at Lucien with a sly smile on his face, completely ignoring the siege around him and pulling down the blindfold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a one-eyed eye is not a hollow, but a black and white gray light ball, which seems to contain infinite changes, as if everything is still solidified, back to the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anatos’s muscles begin to rot at a rate visible to the naked eye, and the yellow pus quickly turns gray, and the pieces of rotten meat will fall off. Hanging on the face, it is a reflection of the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around him, the normal world began to distort, fading all colors and sounds, leaving only the eternal silence and black and white gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
