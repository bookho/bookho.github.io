			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Well, today there are three more<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;................................. .....................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the magic notes, all in a row It is a strange, quirky letter and text. It is not one of the two kinds of words that Lucien met before crossing. The body after crossing is itself a poor person. It is normal to have not studied any words, and can listen to it from instinct. Knowing and speaking the language of this world, without affecting communication, is already the most brilliant luck in the numerous difficulties that Lucien is currently encountering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the current Lucien, tragically became a real illiterate, can only watch the magic notes, a word can not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed and laughed at himself: "The feeling of illiteracy is really uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I passed through this day, I experienced a lot of things, making Lucien more mature and calmer than before. Even before I took notes, I was worried about the threat of the church, hesitating to learn magic, but now, huge Disappointment still impacts the heart of Lucien. As a new era college student with ideals, morality, culture and discipline, the feeling of illiteracy is not good, especially when words are also related to extraordinary rather than human strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much hesitation, just calm for a while, Lucien firmly believes in his heart: "The most important thing at the moment is to learn the words of this world!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you don't choose to learn magic in the future, you have to get rid of the living conditions and status of the underprivileged people. Learning text and acquiring knowledge is still a desirable approach, especially Under the premise that Lucien itself has no powerful strength, strong body and no swordsmanship, it may be very small to get rid of the current identity by means of combat, adventure, and thugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ideas and decisions, Lucien quickly dispelled the disappointment, filled his heart with a little bit of struggle, continued to look at the magic notes, see Do you have other secrets on it, such as treasure maps? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, Lucien frowned slightly, because he saw a lot of familiar things on the magic notes, such as many standard geometric figures, lines Some strange patterns that make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Array, or Magical Imprint?" Lucien guessed according to the "Truth of Truth" and then quickly turned to the back of the magic note, so I saw a row of formulas similar to the chemical equations, except that there are no symbols in these formulas, but some words: "Magic Formula? Potions Formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; These two similarities, let Lucien have some guesses, but he can't understand the words, he can only doubt first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning this magic note over, Lucien opened another book. On top of this, the text was more distorted and the letters were similar to the pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not the same type of text?" So Lucien curiously opened the third book, which featured some plants, ores, monsters, and it seemed It is a book like "Illustration", except that the text above it is the same as the second magic note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The language I will have is probably the one on the first magic note." Lucien speculates on the generality of the difficulty of the text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take three magic notes and books over and over again. After no more gains, Lucien lay in bed and forced himself to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucien, the desire to change one's situation is so strong, from tomorrow, every day must work hard for life, if it is because of sleep Good and weak, but there is no way to better meet tomorrow and seize the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Benjamin’s healing fascination has made Lucien’s wound completely healed, but after a fierce battle, mental and physical exhaustion, Jean Lucine I fell asleep soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the sewer, the witch’s secret room has been completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a black mouse did not know where to run from, his eyes were red, cold, and demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, the Adejan area gradually sounded noisy vocals, water, etc., breaking through the cold of the night, let Lu Xien Feel the vitality and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxon, who likes to wake up in bed for a long time, just woke up and forced himself to get out of bed, ignite the stove, boil water and bake the last That black bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While eating a bready, unpalatable bread, Lucien planned the arrangement today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have to think about things to distract, this black bread is not hunger, and Lucien is absolutely incapable of ingesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First go to find out where to learn the text, and the corresponding conditions, and also have to find a new thing to do, or else you have to starve before learning the text At home." Lucien knows little about the world and can only plan it briefly. "It is best not to be known by familiar people, so as not to show your feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The water in the water tank simply cleaned the lower face. Lucien took out the seven coins in the crates and put them on the body. Although there were not many, it was a little safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locking the door, Lucien went directly to the house where Alisa’s family lived. He didn’t have a slight impression on the terrain of this holy city. Ask people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lucien." A dark-haired girl greeted Lucien with a deep curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien currently does not know her, can only pull out the standard smile, nodded perfunctory: "Hey, I have something to go to Eliza." Then hurried Busy with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lucien, what is the ghost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien What is the feeling of using the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw that one guard lost his right hand. Was it dangerous last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a few steps away from the home of Eliza, but Lucien has encountered several neighbors’ inquiries. Overnight, Lucien seems to have become Ade. Let the famous people in the district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t know anything, he could only walk to Alisha’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After not at the door, Lucien heard a familiar voice: "Little Evans, it’s really early today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien secretly sighed: "Uncle Joel, good morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer is dressed neatly today In the hand, I have a harp with a classic flavor: "Is there a small Evans breakfast? Your body is good, there is no need to be so anxious to find things to do, you Eliza has been calling you to eat." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked Joel to ask about the terrain, prepared for this excuse, see him take the initiative, more assured: "Thank you Uncle Joel, I have already eaten, And yesterday, there was the magical treatment of Benjamin's adults. I was sick and I didn't need to rest any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer nodded and greeted Lucien Walking side by side with yourself: "I have the priest's magical skills, I am relieved, wait for you to go to the Copper Crown Pub to find the boss, he still owes me a bottle of Les Wine, will help you "A good job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said that Xie Gang had to leave, Joel thought about it, put away the face that always laughed, very serious Said: "Little Evans, you are already seventeen years old, and you are not too young. You should think about your future life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Joel, What do you mean?" Lucien asked in a clear way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel sighed: "Being forced to do things, after the age of forty, the body will age very quickly, it is difficult to find a job, if there is no savings, No good son or daughter will be taken away by poverty and disease within a few years. This kind of person, Uncle Joel has seen many, rarely live to be over forty-five years old, you are still young, learn a craft Although the apprenticeship contract is ten years, if you have a good job, you will definitely have a good life when you go to a small place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
