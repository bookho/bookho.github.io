			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Hull" manor is located on the edge of the forest and is a resting place for the Hoffenberg family to hunt in the summer. It is in the early spring, no guests, so even the servant They are all rare, secluded and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study in the manor’s main house is the place where King Hofenberger handles his duties while hunting, and is protected by a strict array of gods, but at this time, in the magic There are three magicians in the array protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas lived here secretly as a royal guest, and the magical robe on his body had to become the most popular high-necked jacket today, which made him quite used to I feel too arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you arranging Douglas to hide here?" It was inconvenient to talk outside, and several people entered the study. Fernando casually asked Hathaway, trying to figure out what it was. Her meaning is also the meaning of "the sword of truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although before the war, he had no time to take into account the scenes of the sky, but since the "death lord" and "ice witch" fell, "the sword of truth" and "The Heart of Time" has lived well. It is not difficult for him to guess the scene at the time. It must have been the betrayal of these two noble knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loss is more than the limit that Fernando can bear, leaving an indelible mark in his heart, and he is even more afraid of the aristocratic knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei nodded gently: "I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a nobleman, but she becomes A magician, plus years of friendship, Fernando is more trusting to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp snorted: "You think that Hathaway’s things can be won by the King, but he deliberately pretends not to know, oh, this time. The situation is really forced by the situation. No aristocrat wants the church to completely destroy the magician's power, as Douglas said, from now on, our conflict with the church will become more and more intense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a little more ambiguity about the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas calmly sits on the mahogany high back chair, the sound is peaceful and authentic: "The earth god is still there, the church of the gods is still there, Dracula is still there, The silver moon is still there, the dark mountains are still there, and the endless ocean is still there. The church is far from being able to abandon the nobility. However, after the coalition is defeated, it is difficult for them to drag most of the church’s power. The control of your own ruling area will reach its peak. You must be prepared. Patience preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not fast or slow. The sound also brought the magnetism unique to the middle-aged gentleman. Although he described the bad situation, he let Fernando and Sharp hear the mood slowly. No longer so embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the power of the legend to influence the environment, or is Douglas already a leader of such a charismatic personality? Fernando quietly flashed this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that patience is useless." After he calmed down, Sharp said his inner fears. This is his worry and "truth." The sword is even more of the nobles, because there is no hope of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas picked up the elegant white glazed cup next to it, took a sip of boiled water, and continued to use the voice that calmed the mind: "From the previous battle, it can be seen that After the 'God Drop', the Pope must have time to recover. In our magician's terminology, the buffer time of this magic is very long. If it is forcibly used within the buffer time, the former pope is a warning, so we don't have to You can't be so afraid of 'God Drops'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Silver Moon' Atena Hard Anti-God's Falling Attack is not dead, just serious injury Escape, indicating that 'God Drop' can still be blocked. If He recovers, we will find a way to let 'Hell Lord' or 'Abyss Will' come, and may not be able to kill the Pope."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an obvious and easy-to-see analysis. It is hard for people who are desperate to calm down and think. The clever mind is covered in fog and can't see anything other than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Douglas slowly analyzing, Sharp’s mood is getting quieter and quieter, as if he has found long-lost confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Summoning the 'Lord of the Hell' or 'Abyss will' will come, requires complicated rituals and great costs, and is easily found and prematurely destroyed by the church. Moreover, 'the abyss will' is crazy bloodthirsty, but it is not the enemy before the summoning." Sharp expressed his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a wizard from a magical empire, Fernando is not a bit repulsive to the summoning of demons and demons, but he does not like these stupid evil guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and said: "I may have to go to hell and talk to 'Lord of the Hell'. He is a sensible class who knows how to analyze and weigh the pros and cons. God, maybe we can find a way to make it easier for him to come. To be honest, I have never had a good impression of the blood sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the promotion of the legend, there is no orientation With the help of the Gate of the World, he is still able to travel in different spaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the time being, wait, I think that in terms of the value of "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy," you should be able to promote again soon." Fernando feels Douglas again It is better to go to hell after being stronger, lest the "Lord of Hell" look down on such "weak" collaborators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no conflict between improving strength and going to hell." Douglas nodded. "According to my estimation, I will reach the third order in about twenty or thirty years. "It's not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his eyes to Sharp: "This road is very dangerous and difficult, but if you don't do it, then there is no hope, only Step by step, you can walk out of a path of hope in the darkness of despair."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the current situation is not too bad, huh, I mean For your magician, since the fall of Aalto and the fall of the 'Death Lord', the upper level of the church has not paid much attention to the magician. The main eyes are concentrated on the churches and dark creatures, that is, you The hunt and strangled encounters will be much lighter than in the past.” Sharp spoke out the important changes he felt during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and laughed at himself: "Weaknesses also have weak benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando The face scornfully interjected: "I originally thought that if Ivan could not become a pope, he would conflict with Gregory. Who knows, he is like a sheep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the clergy comes from the "God of Truth". If you oppose the Pope chosen by the "God of Truth", it is equivalent to rebelling against God. No cleric dares to do this kind of thing, there will be no companions. There are no supporters, and it is said that the Pope has a means called 'exceptional punishment' that isolates the relationship between the clergy and the 'God of Truth.' Let their 'belief' become a purely unfilled thing. So, How can Ivan directly conflict with Gregory?" Douglas shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei suddenly opened, cold and authentic: "There is a penalty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is..." Douglas nodded solemnly. "However, we don't have to be disappointed. Ivan may not directly conflict with Gregory. But it does not mean that he is not willing to create trouble for Gregory, establish an enemy, maybe. He The attitude towards our magician has changed. We have to try to get in touch later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four people discussed for a long time and determined many plans for the future, Fernando I felt the passion again, that was the feeling when I first entered the "Sorcerer Union." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas patted the clothes and stood up and said: "Fernando, you are seriously injured, take a break, wait until you have time, and we will exchange magic knowledge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will discuss with you the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy", which is definitely the most brilliant and brilliant book in the history of magic." Fernando did not marry his own praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled: "I am very happy to get your evaluation, and I am proud of my work, but the more things I have researched, my doubts. The more, the huh, the unknown is always so intoxicating, what is gravity, what is its essence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...the problem of this kind Height and depth made Fernando and Hathaway stunned, and I didn't know what to answer. Only Sharp, who didn't know the arcane, shrugged his shoulders and walked to the window to pull the curtains apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear and pure sunshine sprinkled in from outside the house, and the golden color that was created was brilliant, and it was already dawning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fernando, I need you to help other magicians to re-establish a joint union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
