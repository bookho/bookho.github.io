			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the end, what went wrong, the fission reactor exploded several times...! Fernando’s reminder of Lucien was not at all in mind, as long as nothing else Legendary peaks or third-order hands and feet, even if you can't make any reaction, the magical effect of the body and the passive magic can ensure that you survive in the fission explosion and are not affected by the curse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair seems to have been blown by the wind, the unusual mess, the red magic robe on his body is full of folds, a pair of people just experienced the catastrophe, but he has no idea The attention is all placed on the possible problems of the fission reactor. The tone is slightly violent and has strong doubts. According to his research in the field of fission and the reverse cracking of the legendary magic of "atomic fission", it should not exist. The problem is right, such as the fission reaction that occurs when the explosion is out of control!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times? "Lu Xien took a breath and took a breath. This is not the second fission reactor runaway explosion, but the third, fourth, and even fifth and sixth. It is no wonder that he can coincide with "small probability". I run into it - because it is not a "small probability" at all.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Lucien really understands why the teacher rarely took himself to wait for the students to do magic experiments. At most, it is a relatively simple kind of blackbody radiation. It is so dangerous to follow him for magic experiments! It is not a legend that means that there will be no bones at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando frowned: "Several times are not the focus, the point is why, this is not contradictory to the atomic fission, the spell model and the fission principle. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "'Atomic fission is an uncontrollable range of killing magic, and the reactor requires a gentle and controllable, maybe the problem is out in this aspect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so stupid, directly copying the 'atomic fission, the spell model to arrange?" Fernando said in a bad mood, "You have seen our reactor model and detailed layout yourself. It should be clear that we have added a lot of magic arrays for energy utilization and control." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this does not mean that the real controllable peace is slow. I think that in order to solve this problem, we must study the process of fission reaction in more depth. Understand the role of neutrons and other particles to understand the different reactions they may cause under different conditions. Lu Xien also thought about the problem of out of control of fission reactors. The initial suspicion is that the current research is too simple and rude. At present, the design of the reactor mainly relies on "reverse cracking", and the different roles of slow neutrons and fast neutrons have not been found. · Even less aware of their different effects in different fission reactions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the real advice, Fernando has never been scornful, but never confessed in language: Haven't I had this problem? But it takes a long time to re-do the magic experiment of neutron bombarding different elements under different conditions. Well, I and Hathaway are already <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neutron It is impossible to accelerate with an electromagnetic field, so the bombardment experiment is much more complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also tried to do an experiment in this area." Lucien smiled, "complete the research of small nuclear fission devices as soon as possible. Our artificial planet In order to play a greater role, and let the church and other enemies imitate, there is no way to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orbital operation of the artificial planet itself and the acceptance of electromagnetic waves are not Complicated, it belongs to the category that can be imitated. But fission reactors, if there is no in-depth study of the fission process, then the church and other enemies will only have the explosion accidents that teachers often encounter during this time, and cannot be fundamentally excluded— If they don't understand which magic pattern plays a role, they naturally cannot combine or discard them when they change to the corresponding magic symbols. Any single problem that causes problems can lead to serious accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the difference between "the most advanced areas of arcane" and "relative frontier areas". After all, the "launching" process of this world is too simple and too rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently beheaded: "As long as a stable fission reactor can be completed, miniaturization is a matter of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In this magical world, many technical problems that cannot be completed on Earth are no longer problems. For example, fission reactors built by Fernando and Hathaway directly use the magic array to convert the energy released into electricity, etc. Taking up the extra volume, of course, the resulting miniaturization costs will be very high, except that the parliament itself pays for the installation on the artificial planet, it is estimated that only the Archmage and the legendary magician can use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the teacher's confidence, Lucien smiled: "The fission reactor and miniaturization are just the first steps in our accumulated experience. Controllable nuclear fusion is our real goal. At that time, we can all call ourselves the Sun King. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controlled nuclear fusion······" Fernando has some yearnings and frowns again, the difficulty of this problem is not a fission reactor On the order of magnitude, Dove, Douglas, and Hathaway have no clue, and Lucien can't make any useful suggestions. "Or first explore the fission reaction..."<br /><br />&nbsp </ br> Here, he habitually ridiculed: "All arcane masters who have in-depth research in the microscopic field, the most important experiment at present is to bombard other particles with different particles, from countless experimental data. Find the group that may contain mystery, and the alchemists like repetitive labor are more than the Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not just that part of the research. Arcane master, most magicians Knowing that particle bombardment experiments in the microscopic field are most likely to find new discoveries." Lucien snorted. "They are full of fear of the electronic properties of the wonderful, as if they contain things that destroy the world, plus the quantum mechanics itself. I can't make a theoretical and new experimental contribution, and I can only take this road that is absolutely not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as on Earth, particle bombardment and The collision experiment is the most basic and most likely place to discover mysteries in the microscopic field. The only difference is that the high-level magicians of the parliament can arrange the corresponding experimental devices. They don’t have to wait in line to wait until the researchers like the earth can use them. Verify your guess or derivation by colliding with the data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if you reach the stage of the Large Hadron Collider, the scenes may become more and more similar, such as the current mid-level magician, to be similar Magic experiments can only be expected on a few roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a student or friend of a high-level magician, the second is working in a place such as the Atomic Research Institute, and the third is a rich family, please be high The magician helps to arrange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four are applying to the Magic Research Council, entering the queuing sequence, waiting for free access to the large open lab of the Allinge Magic Tower - this is Lucien Specially proposed at the highest scoring group meeting, so that the middle and lower level magicians can also do the expected research without spending money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has a bright red eye: "Not all of your 'observer effects, let them be afraid and panic."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien made a haha ​​and shifted the topic: "Teacher, did you have a field study today? Mr. Brooke hasn't come yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Research? Study what to do! I am full of infinity, infinity, infinity, and do not understand what the study is!" Lucien's words are just right, Fernando is like a ignited alchemy explosive Then it broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien would like to comfort the teacher, every person who studies the field, there are millions of infinity hidden in the room, which is deep in the microscopic field. Study things that can't be avoided. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr. Dirac, who proposed the Dirac equation (that is, the relativistic quantum mechanical equation Lucian equation), is one of the founders of quantum field theory. The top ten and even the top five great physicists in Lu Xien’s mind are precisely because they hold different views on infinity. They think that the emergence of infinity should have its own inevitable reasons and deep meanings. There may be mistakes, so it is against the use of mathematical methods for reforming, which led him to gradually leave the most cutting-edge field (cognitive world broken solidification?). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After roaring for a while, Fernando calmed down: "Brook is coming a little late, but even if there is infinity in a higher approximation, we build it up. This field theory itself does preliminarily describe the interaction of charged particles, that is, the nature of electromagnetic force...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is against himself, Brooke and Lucien The joint research is still quite satisfactory, except for the damn infinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the field of research, Fernando and Brooke believe that electromagnetic force is achieved by exchanging photons with charged particles, with many different processes, but this photon is The photons in daily research are different and cannot be observed. They are mathematical conclusions. They call it a virtual photon. After discussing the issue of quantum field theory, Fernando suddenly said: "Stannis told me that the dark mountains are not calm, the dark guys are like Lunta. Only after the war, we re-recognized us and began to measure the problems of cooperation and confrontation with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
