			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the Angels" Mekan Tron opened his hands, and the whole person formed a shape of a cross, solemn and solemn: "The Pope Wicken Lord Sleeping, stealing authority, so I am looking for a devout saint to judge this greatest sorcerer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by the light, eighteen pairs of rays After the wings are unfolded, the entire prayer room is completely filled, creating an ethereal and sacred image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicken?" It seems that Clement, who is in the embrace of thirty-six angel wings, has retreated a little, and the "king of angels" finally Believe that the church is a "disaster king" Viken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the saints such as Ivan, Felix, and Gonno were encircling the "Pale Lord" Wilfrid, they stumbled upon a death. The gaps in the spiritual world, from the mouth of the legendary Necromancers such as the Lich King, knew the secrets of the god of truth and the pope, and gained a lot in the Temple of the Necromancer, and learned how to steal the power of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they secretly connected in series, rebelling against the pope at the highest theological conference, accusing the incarnation of the Lord of Hell, and succeeding in splitting the church afterwards - Wicken believed Wilfrid, who did not participate in the trip to the world of the dead, only had the results of early pseudo-god studies, and could not know his own secrets. Therefore, he was confidently sent Ivan and others to kill him. Otherwise, this kind of thing would definitely Choose your own secret hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result, I don’t know when the legendary magician "Pale of the White" has colluded with the legendary undead in the dead world, so There was a loophole in the successful plan, the church was split, and the conditions for the creation of the Magic Council by Douglas and others were also provided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Ivan, Felix, etc. could not have tried to contact the "king of angels". Instead, they spent a lot of money on it. Great energy, trying to let the "king of angels" stand on their side, so that the authority of the pope will be completely shaken, but the "king of angels" Mecan Tron refuses to believe that the pope is "disaster king" Viken firmly supports the Southern Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Northern Church is not much worse than the Southern Church in the teachings of the "God of Truth", but there is no way to summon the gods of the blazing angels. The darlings are coming, and they can't borrow their power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I was blinded, but the magical parliament’s exploration of the dead world exposed his hidden secrets, and I must be at the time of the Lord’s sleep. The glory of defending, waking up with the most perfect gesture." "The King of Angels" Mekan Tron sorrowfully said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Magic Council explores the realm of the dead..." Hearing the words of "The King of Angels", Clement was shocked, he had long since The channels of the "God of Truth and Pope Wicken", which are arranged by the Magic Council, are known to all channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this story is very exaggerated in many places, people can be heard as jokes, but there is also a complete fit, others may not be able to hear, can be passed on to the saints Gono's strength and knowledge, and he secretly cooperated with the Lord of Hell, but when he first heard it, he was shocked by the abnormality, because he was basically consistent with his own understanding, and more perfect and meticulous, with many powerful details. Therefore, he had to think that the Magic Council really had a lot of gains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the "King of Angels" who live in "Mount Heaven" also recognizes that the exploration of the Magic Council touches on the core secrets? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that in the story of the Magic Council, the "King of Angels" Mekantron is the embodiment of the "God of Truth" Tanos, The resurrection of the reliance, that is to say, is the real deputy king of heaven, the real "Little God of Truth"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real reason why he is willing to believe that the Pope is the "disaster king" Viken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless thoughts flashed in Clement's mind. Finally, greed rushed and asked tentatively: "Respected King of the Angels, sir, you are coming to me." Is it in front of me that I recognize my piety and agree with my qualifications for dedication and sacrifice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, compared to Berkovsky You are a qualified 虔 虔 。 ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” Holiness, every move is in accordance with the teachings of the Lord, and the determination is determined, and the courage to sacrifice for the Lord is really a rare true saint, so I want to give it to you, so that you have enough strength to defend the glory of the Lord, and judge the sinners. Viken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of the gods? A mysterious mystery that goes further than the method of inheriting power from others? Clement felt that his breathing seemed to be heavy. He cooperated with the Lord of Hell, not to steal the divine nature, and to obtain the secret of the god from there. However, the Lord of Hell is a natural god, and he himself I don't know why I am a god. On the contrary, Tanos and Wicken's non-natural gods, which have been traced to the truth, have grown from ordinary people to the existence of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, does the Book of Virtue really contain the mystery of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Clement suppressed his excitement and greed, and discretion: "I am willing to defend the glory of the Lord, but Viken has stolen the Lord. The power has become a kind of god. It is not what I can handle now. Sacrifice is very important. It is meaningless without sacrifice. I can promise with faith, waiting for me to have no more power than Weiken. At that time, I will swear to defend the glory of the Lord and judge the sinner Viken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I want to cooperate, at least your "Book of Virtue" will make me God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old foxes are not seen in rabbits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels" Mecan Tron flew the gold book in his hand to Clement: "Your answer makes me very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the "Book of Virtue", Clemente refused to see Mecan Tron in front of him, hurriedly looking at it, the more excited the expression, the more excited Excitement--In the past, they used to steal the power of faith and the power of inheritance. The conversion rate is very low. Therefore, the saints of the northern church are seeking improvement, but the effect is not great, but he sees the virtue. After the book, those difficulties seem to vanish in an instant, because it fundamentally points out the problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you look at it, the more you are surprised, the more you look at it, the more excited you are. Clement faintly thinks that this book of Virtue really contains the secret of the gods. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before dealing with Viken, I have some tasks for you." Mecanthon said with a low voice, "In the abyss 555th The layer of 'chaotic starry sky, the core, there is a kind of called <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Skystone slate, the legendary material, you will take it and give it to me, I will give you afterwards Reward for the corresponding value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic Starry Sky?" Clement wondered that he had feared that "The King of Angels" gave him a dangerous mission, but it looked Is it a good thing? Go to the abyss and get a legendary grade of material? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mecan Tron has probably talked about the "chaotic starry sky" and ended up saying: "Prophecy gave me a hint "Atomic control, Lucien = Evans needs a legendary class of space-time materials, and knows from the elves that the existence of the time-space slate, so you have to be careful that he also goes to the 'chaotic starry sky.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, 'King of the Angels, sir." Clemente sighed in relief, Lucien = Evans and himself are the same level, even if they really can't beat, can't they escape? And this is still vying for material, not a deep hatred, if you encounter life and death, as long as the time and space slate is thrown out, Lucien = Evans will not risk chasing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that as long as you hurry, you can get the "spatial slate" before Lucien = Evans, there is no need to meet him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels" Mecan Tron’s face showed a smile of satisfaction, and the body that descended on the projection gradually dissipated and turned into countless tiny angels. Singing, praising, and praying for a long time before it disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 666th floor of the abyss, within the "frozen fortress". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Dark Lord" above the throne of Gossip, Gonheim looked like a smile and looked at the void in front of him, his right hand groping the armrest of the black throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the handrail is inlaid with faint or psychedelic gems. Gonheim's long ten fingers are constantly jumping among them, as if playing A piece of music, Wu Qing's nails glitter with the luster of the chaotic soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while he chuckled, the void in front of him burst open, and there was a red magma, which was boundless, constantly rolling and bubbling, hot and abnormal Like a boiling red ocean! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
