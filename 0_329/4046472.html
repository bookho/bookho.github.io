			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Kingdom of Buriana, Fama Kearia, a magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense and solemn melody at the end of the Allinge Weekly Review of the Year reverberates in the room, and the tall, thin, bearded Archmage Roland will turn the radio Closed, the face sneered with sneer: "The tendency of 'Lark" is obvious, good students taught by Nesika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them For the status of the magician, knowing the true identity of the "Lark" Samantha is not a difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a study with soft crystal lights and dark red curtains. Roland is standing at the desk and watching several of his students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man with white hair is equally resentful: "The 'real world', 'voice of mystery' is something that Lucien has done with his hands, no matter what The Larks are so well concealed that they sit under the ass and there is no doubt that this chair is the particle theory. How can this objective program allow the Lark to deliberately guide the tendency and weaken the confidence of the supporters!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks much older than Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Colster, what is the relationship between weakening confidence? The world of arcane is the most fair place, no matter how many methods they play, how many tricks to play, and finally Still have to use real experimental results or objective phenomena to speak." Although I just mocked the Lark, Roland did not care too much, as a dazzling magi of great honor, this aspect of his heart and mind There are still some, just wait for the completion of the experiment, take the results and images to play the face of Sean and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colster is next to a young man with linen hair, said to be young, and the brown eyes are a bit vicissitudes, it seems to have experienced After a long period of scouring, he hesitated a little: "Teacher, experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manuel?" Roland frowned and looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel squirmed his lower lip and finally said: "Teacher, you must be fully prepared for the results of the experiment, perhaps not necessarily negating the quantum hypothesis of light." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged lady with light purple hair also seized the opportunity: "Teacher, many things in recent years have shown that the light quantum hypothesis seems to really explain the photoelectric effect perfectly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Roland glared at them angrily, and his students shook confidence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the explanation, then I would rather not explain the photoelectric effect!" He shouted and rushed out of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night outside the window, the spring rain is continuous, as if symbolizing a bumper harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Lucien adjusts the magic array while using The Alchemy Viewer concentrates on flickering fluorescent dots, trying to distinguish between what they want to find from their positional strengths, recorded data, and confusing complex trajectories, while the other side, the improved magic array The strong current passes through the Ziz sound, and the surrounding space faintly shows signs of magnetic field distortion. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the storm dominated the experiment of smashing the atomic stream to bombard the metal foil, Lucien applied to the Magic Research Council for the transformation of the lab magic and alchemy. Device, this is enough to complete this experiment - the Atomic Research Institute claims to study the microscopic world, the internal structure of the atom, since the storm dominates the existence of the nucleus by means of particle collision, and proposes the structural mode of celestial operation, that atomic research The similar requirements put forward are very legitimate and naturally satisfied very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien found the trajectory of the expected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of data such as charge-to-mass ratio, charge, mass, etc. instantly emerged in Lucien’s mind, letting him stand up, change the magic array, and start measuring the trajectory. Representing particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time is fast, and the measurement is getting closer to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge quality ratio is the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same quality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data overlaps one by one, and the bangs, Lu Xien’s cognition of the world seems to be virtual, and the elements of the starry sky and the wind and water environment are changing again. The core of the electron surround becomes a combination of two kinds of particles. The difference between different elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon is only the difference in the number of particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hydrogen nucleus! This is the "proton"! This is the essence of the element! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive world changes are completed in an instant, Lucien only feels that he is more sensitive to the elements, and at the same time, seize this rare opportunity, thoroughly Into the meditation, the mental power becomes illusory, it seems to have both the surname of the wave and the characteristics of the particle. This is not just a simple synthesis of particles and waves, even a single "spiritual quantum" also shows the wave. One side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the electromagnetic kingdom, Brooke stepped into his experiment as if he were in fantasy room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ice cold silver metal, strange inexplicable pattern, jumping flashing arc, twisting dark magnetic field, vast and deep vacuum...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in front of a complex alchemy platform with a safe area for lab notes and data records on the right hand side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glanced at the experimental results recorded before the improvement of the magical array, Brooke’s old-fashioned face showed an inexplicable look, and then he converges on all emotions. Dedicated to the magic circle and start experimenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When going to the magic lab, Roland’s emotions have been Restoration, Manuel and Diana, who are afraid of coming behind, said: "You have to do your own thing, I have to start experimenting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;马Nuer seems to want to say something more. Roland has already entered the laboratory. The door of the silver-white electric snake quickly closes and cuts the space inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should it be okay?" Manuel asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crester looked coldly: "It’s okay, and there are things that the optical quantum assumptions such as diffraction images cannot explain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Middle-aged woman Diana thought about it. If she changed her own, no matter what the outcome should be, it would be a small problem. At most, the cognitive world was created and it took several years. Time to make up, after all, three years of time, let her be psychologically prepared for what results, the cognitive world is slowly changing, and even more biased to the other side, so the teacher should also have little problem...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night dress-style magic robe unfolds, light gray will roland from head to toe, he carefully examined the magic array, the alchemy device is intact, just like every time in the past, meticulously conduct experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world of initial substantiveization, filling every corner The spirit of the spirit is in a strange shock, and the "spiritual quantum" unfolds into a cloud of strange and incomprehensible clouds. When they are carefully felt, they change back to the shape of a single particle or the shape of a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everything stabilized and the cognitive world disappeared, Lucien opened his eyes and understood that the unique meditation that lasted more than three years was finally completed. One step can be called "Evans's Two Elephants", but this is temporarily the first stage of the results, and there will be room for improvement in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With this meditation, the hidden dangers of my forced promotion can be made up." Lucien used the "two elephants meditation" after a brief meditation The result is that the efficiency is at least three times higher than the current high-level best meditation idea, and it will be promoted to the seventh ring in about a year or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years, due to the hidden danger of the soul, Lucien’s mental strength has increased unsatisfactory, and he has focused on exploring the unique meditation and learning the six-ring magic. In the creation of new magic, there are currently twenty-one magical spells in the soul. Among them, the newly created magic is in addition to the curse "professor's care", as well as the electromagnetic system and the star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Lucien repeats the experiment, then takes out the special parchment and quill, and starts writing the thesis at the lab table: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I named this basic particle 'proton', which has a positive charge equal to the negative charge of the electron. From the mass comparison and the electric first name, the hydrogen atom should be composed of a proton and an electron. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...to continue this inference, we found that the order of the periodic table is based on the number of protons, that is, the number of nuclear charges. From the calculation of mass and electromagnetic theory, I can predict that in addition to protons in the nucleus, there is a medium-named particle of the same mass but not charged, and its number is the difference of the same element..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not stick to the experimental results, but launched the inferences. It seems that a complete theoretical system should be established. Where there is no experimental confirmation, bold predictions are made according to the theory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Starting from the celestial operating structure proposed by my teacher, we introduce quantum theory and quantify the structure of electrons around the nucleus... electrons are no longer It is a circular motion, but at different energy levels, directly shifting after absorbing and releasing energy, without going through the intermediate level...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...hydrogen spectral line The discontinuity can confirm this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lucien did not wait for the cooperation of other conclusions, but introduced the quantization directly based on the knowledge of the Earth. The atomic structure skips many intermediate results and boldly predicts various phenomena.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble, if there is no thunder, it sounds from the cognitive world It once again emerges like a virtual illusion. The electrons that surround the movement of the nucleus stop, and are on different orbits of energy levels. They sometimes absorb the "spiritual quantum" transition, and sometimes the "spiritual quantum" after the fall, Lu Xi'an Spiritual power is in a wonderful state of birth and death <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without distraction and cognitive changes in the world, Lucien continues to write on the book:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ... The number of outer electrons shows the alchemy of the elements. All the alchemy reactions can be described in depth with the concept of 'gaining electrons'. The ionization and elemental valences belong to this category... The outer layers are electronically arranged, I guess they have a stable number in each layer of orbit, which remains to be further explored..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... As a result, the alchemy faction is completely integrated into the field of elements! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, the electrons at the outermost layer of the nucleus begin to exchange electrons with the surrounding elements, forming a variety of complex substances, "world" changes. Colorful, the elemental order spell model is once again improved, close to perfection!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of magic, the quill will quickly write Lucien’s inner thoughts Come out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness outside the window is darker and darker, and the moist air brings a thick rain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the laboratory, as the data was recorded one by one, the image gradually formed, and Bruker’s serious and thin face brows tightly, it is difficult Peaceful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last set of data was recorded, Brooke did not write a conclusion, but looked at the "Electromagnetic Kingdom" outside the window through the metal wall, sighed gently Tone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, in the thunder of thunder, a thick road like a mountain The silver-white lightning is fierce, crushing the distorted magnetic field, and smashing the flowing current and the beating arc into the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-plane below the surface All the substances seem to collapse under the strong magnetic field, showing a distorted and devastating scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire electromagnetic kingdom seems to have reached the end of existence. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." The magic tower trembled violently, and Barrek looked at the upper level with utter disorientation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Buriana.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a group Group data, looking at the experimental images, Roland's face could not restrain the signs of panic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
