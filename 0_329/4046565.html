			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the electromagnetic communication matrix, a mature and beautiful female voice came in the monocle: "Lu Xien?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;;?;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien stunned, who did not respond to it for a while, until the other party opened again, only to remember that she is a member of the Panel, the great Arcanian Lord Oliver's wife, Ms. Florencia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Florencia, have something to look for?" Lucien asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa smiled and said: "Do you think I am very free? Nothing, who will be bored to contact you? For Oliver this paper, what do you have? What? You should see this issue of "Arcane"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is more confused, this kind of thing will be discussed privately with your husband. Why bother to ask me this outsider, but Lu Xien immediately remembered that their husband and wife seemed to be in conflict, so smiled: "Looked, and already discussed with Mr. Lavendi, Mr. Gaston, if you are not Mind, I will start talking directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Florence gave a quick answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing the views on this paper, Florensa was silent, and the sound was a little low: "Lusien, Oliver is looking for you." With the creation of the opera? You better not agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Oliver's private plan to please his wife was actually known to Florence? This makes Lucien quite surprised, too confidential, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa’s repressed voice reveals a touch of lightness and pride: “He always complains that Holm has no real musicians, he can’t The script was adapted into a great opera, so if he wanted to write a new opera to please me, how could he let go of the master who is in the top position in the history of music?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how do you know that he wants to use the opera to please you?" Lucien understood that Florenza was inferred from her husband’s understanding and the tacit understanding between husband and wife, so she just started. He asked a little curiously about his emotional life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa smiled and seemed to contain a very complex emotion: "He does this every time, not his own jewelry or feelings." Poetry is a new opera. The first two methods of pleasing have been used twice recently. It is easy to judge a new opera with a name that he will not repeat in a short time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you let me promise? Why don't you forgive him?" Lucien asked him to take a picture of himself. How can this question be asked directly? Sure enough, I also have a gossip side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa snorted without a smile, and sighed bitterly: "After you wrote "Dedicated to Silvia", Silvia is dead. If I write another opera that is meant to make up for the couple's feelings but separates the husband and wife, I think your love music will become a curse in people's hearts. I will let you not promise and be good for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien keenly captured the meaning of Florentha: "Ms., do you want to dissolve your marriage with Lord Oliver?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Florensa answered silently, and then liked to say, "I have tolerated again and again, but he never really repents, I am tired. I am desperate, and I don’t want to entangle with him anymore. I have my own art of arcane and magic. There are teachers, classmates, and friends. I have lost the value and meaning of life without leaving him. Sometimes, Love can't cover everything, maybe after separation, I can still find new happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;She calmly stated that there was no screaming and no crying, which made Lucien listen to the decisiveness and determination in her words, as if it was a deliberate decision, not a momentary impulse, so there was no persuasion And, smiled and said: "Then I wish you a woman in advance to start a new life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from Floresa’s unconsciously revealed to Oliver Familiar and understanding, can they be so easily separated? Lucian is very suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa’s voice is low: "Loutine, you are a good man. I often think, if I didn't touch Oliver, I waited. Now that you are more talented and loyal and gentler than him, my marriage should be so happy that I am envious of Xiao Natasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for complimenting." Although I received a good man card, Lucien, who already has a lover, didn't mind, thanked him with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa suddenly smiled: "Actually, I have had the idea of ​​revenge on Oliver, ready to find a good man like him to have a soul and body. The double relationship, oh, one of my goals at the time was yours, but you completely ignored my charm, and I can't take the psychological barrier myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you have a little Natasha, I will not even be more, I have suffered this kind of pain myself, and will not let other girls suffer this kind of injury that can never be forgotten. Lucy Well, for Xiao Natasha, if you have another woman, then I will seduce her and let her leave you completely. Oh, she has lost her mother before she is an adult. She should like my mature Female surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slammed his chin and quickly shifted the subject: "Ms. You said that I am one of the goals, there are other goals. ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa poured out, feeling a lot more comfortable, strong Lively smiled and said: "I have a high vision, meet my requirements very little, and have a strong background, will not be killed by Oliver, so, apart from you, I have thought about seduce my teacher, however, I have analyzed it carefully. The success rate should not be high. Lucien, you said that if my long skirt is studded with precious materials such as sea bream, sun stone, cryolite, dragon skin, etc., will the teacher be directly fascinated? I was tempted by me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien directly pointed out: "I think that Lord Morris will take off your long skirt and push you down on the bed. Then go straight with the long skirt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha! I think so too!" Florensa first glimpsed, then laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up his eyebrows and suddenly felt that the elders behind him were not good. He quickly asked: "I haven’t seen Lord Morris for a while, I don’t know. What research is he busy with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you propose a new alchemy, the teacher's saliva is flowing out, it is the field that can grasp the material changes, really To study it, how many treasures there are, how much treasure he has, so he has all his heart on it.” Florensa joked, in fact, for Morris, Donald, Raven The elements of the Jiuhuan faction are the Masters. The new alchemy is to let them see the dawn of the promotion legend. How can they not study it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also replied humorously: "If neither Morris and Aphrodite are one person, I suspect that Aphrodite is Morris. Your illegitimate child, he really has a dragon-like desire to keep money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few chats, Florensa wished: "Lu Xien works hard, Strive to get a child early and Natasha gave birth to a child. If I and Oliver didn't like the world of two people, it might not be the end now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now The situation is too dangerous, it is not suitable for children, and she is only less than a month old, and there are still several years of urging and stress.” Lu Xi’s thought also told Natasha that there will be many changes in the next few years. It is easy for a child to weaken her fighting power and get into danger, so she will not consider this issue until the situation in Holm is stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha agrees very much about this, and she hopes to be able to enter a marriage with Lucien and let her children be born in a healthy family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the higher the level, the more difficult the concept of pregnancy, the "compulsory pregnancy" on the "Pink Book" is not developed to play, it is a certain The legendary magician created to continue the blood. When I saw this magic, Lucien suddenly had a kind of auditory hallucination of "treatment of infertility, to the Aringe Magic Hospital." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending the call with Florencia, Lucien was a bit hesitant, on the relationship, Florenza is a student of Lord Morris, Lord Morris is Natasha's elders, who are considered to be in the same camp, should refuse to cooperate with Lord Oliver at her request, but they have already promised Oliver that repentance is a bad behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, Lucien had the decision: "I will only create the opera until they dismiss the marriage. At that time, if Oliver wants to opera, If you want to recombine, then there is no conflict with Ms. Florencia's request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and Ms. Florencia asked me not to create Does it mean that she still has a little swing in her heart, worried that she is shaking under the opera's offensive... I hope that the couple will be divorced and will not end in tragedy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
