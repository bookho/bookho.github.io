			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the "Ivan", "Aleke", "Ulier", "Felix" and "Angel of Light" Appeared, they rushed here earlier than Douglas, Fernando and other legendary magicians, but they never went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Berkovsky, what do we do?" "Aleksey is called by the current Pope Bilkovsky of the North." "Saint Ivan", between words, puts himself in an approximate position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Santa Ivan" golden eyebrows are slightly wrinkled and stained A layer of pale yellow blue eyes focused on the gray after the soul fireplace: "I suspect that the monster is still inside, and there is no coordinate change rule left by Muskilllin or Viken. I don't know it inside. Where to go, do not know how to find their last whereabouts, can only rely on luck. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is vaguely afraid, and seems to have encountered what he encountered when he explored the entrance. He was too risky to be able to perform the power of "God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we first transfer the 'Holy Spirit Room'? "Felix"'s gaze is also condensed on the gray rampage, and I don't see the entrance of the illusory ripples, as if there is no curiosity about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Santa Ivan" silently said: "But I suspect that the people of the Magic Council dare to come to explore the Temple of the Necromancer, just because they got the things left by Muskillin or Viken, after all, Wicken’s nest is just right. At the edge of the Kingdom of Holm, and when the big cross-frame is broken, Hathaway is also on the scene. If they find the relics of the legendary magicians of that year and know how to enter the 'immortal chamber', then The wishes and dreams of the saints of the past are hard to come by. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, his eyes glanced at the rumor shrouded in illusory ripples.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Before the "Ullil" they spoke, "Ivan" continued: "So I entered with Mikhail, you transfer the 'Holy Spirit Room', he is projecting with the God's surname item, even I have died in it, and the problem is not big. I have enough strength to guarantee it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mikhail refers to the "Angel of Light".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good , Berkovsky, don't care, we don't know what happened to Maskillin and Viken, why they never came out. "Ullil" whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that Maskillin and others have died, after all, go deeper into the Temple of the Dead. The more abnormal the time flow rate is, the outer day is equivalent to five days outside, and the soul fireplace is about seven or eight days. The inside should be more horrible, and the outside disappeared for nearly a thousand years of Muskilllin, Viken, etc. The legendary magician may have just passed a hundred years in the "world of the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan" nodded slightly: "They have encountered more than what they have encountered." Our imagination, even with their items to display prayers, prophetic techniques, etc. can not determine their life and death, but this time there is a magical parliament to explore the road ahead, if there is any danger, I can withdraw in time . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief discussion, "Ivan" and "Angel of Light" crossed the soul fireplace and entered a gray road, "Alekeke "When the saints return to the Holy Spirit Room, they are not allowed to be found by the magical parliament's reinforcements in accordance with the rules of the coordinates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul fireplace is restored to the calming silence, this At the time, the Lich King, surrounded by a strange gemstone, stood out from the wall, and two red needles stared at the entrance where Lucien and others entered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, a transparent ghost flew over, wearing a black robe with a gorgeous reddish pattern: "Don't go in?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from its attitude and tone that it is the same as the Lich King, one of the masters of the outer region of the Temple of the Dead. Ghost Lord.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid I will not come out when I go in." The Lich King’s voice was hoarse and sorrowful. The anger that had been invaded by Lucien had subsided, and he no longer felt that he had sacred the Holy Temple of the Dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost The voice of the lord whispered: "You are not afraid of punishing us after the Lord wakes up?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes and Crosos went in and we had to guard outside to prevent more enemies from breaking into the temple." The Lich King's two-pointed red awns flashed coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost lord floated in situ: "Yes, Chiaps was killed by the enemy. If we go in again, the outer defense will become vacuum." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary necroons look at each other and sneak in the vicinity, waiting for the "survivors" coming out from inside, and guarding against other strong players. Sneak into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dome is grey, the tiles are grey, and the walls are grey The torches and burning flames that are inserted on both sides are also gray. Lucien can't see any other colors except himself, as if he came to a distorted world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to check why the flame can burn, and Lucien flies very fast and runs down the ramp. After a few seconds, he sees it. A closed black door, which is striking in the gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the grand exaggeration of the rest of the Temple of the Dead, this two-meter-high pure black unpatterned gate gave Lucien the human Very intimate feeling, as if returning to the Kingdom of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I checked the door urgently. After not finding the trap, Lucien directly opened it with “opening the door”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the black door slowly opening backwards, the gray hall inside appears in the eyes of Lucien, except for the three black gates in the three corners, Nothing, the ashes are dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the other, Lucien has smashed several similar halls in succession. After feeling the change of time and space, he slowed down the movement and did not dare to go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The grey halls are too weird, the same empty, four black doors in the same four corners, if the pattern and the pillars are slightly different, It’s just that people think it’s the same hall.” Lucien gave himself the magic to trigger spells, spells, and other spells. While looking around, while secretly yelling at others, I’m afraid that these gray halls are fake. The black door is the "ontology." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the environmental parameters just collected, Lucien was slightly surprised to find out: "The rule of coordinates left by Mr. Muskilllin is completely applicable here. This is not afraid of not finding the way back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The frequency of the change of the building here is too exaggerated? Almost every time I open two doors, It will change once." Lucien's mental arithmetic, quite strangely thought, although this way, his own security is guaranteed, for example, after opening a black door to escape, tracking the hell of his own Or when the legendary Necromancer opens the same black door again, it is likely that the hall behind the door has changed, but it also increases the danger for himself. Who knows if the hall behind the door has changed into an enemy? That one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the prophetic class and the probe class magic have been greatly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to be vigilant." Lucien once again added a bunch of magic to enhance his intuition and foreboding. In the previous battle, "monthly time" Three times of "advanced time stop" have been consumed, and "gravity collapse" is only one time left, and the "Elemental Blessing" of the Arcanist's Robe and the "Dead Barrier" of the Ring of Congers are also used up. In a short period of time, in addition to transforming the epic knight to pick up the shield of truth, the only legendary defense that he can use is only the "time and space scepter". "You have to find a quiet place to crack the crown of the ancient mummies. More than one legendary item. There is more than one guarantee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is only four or five "black doors" from the exit. Lucien is not too reassuring, just happens to encounter the enemy. Very big, so I randomly picked a black door, carefully checked and then pushed open with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the gray color, Lucien suddenly caught a little silvery light, and suddenly he was on high alert, and the spiritual field spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey hall is still quiet and unmanned, but the ground has more patterns left behind by the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original material has long since disappeared, leaving only a trace of silver and white on the ground, complicated and wonderful, which makes Lu Xien feel sacred and solemn, and makes him feel inexplicable As if it were the most ** of the world, this is very similar to the feeling that the martyrdom originally gave people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
