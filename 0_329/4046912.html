			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "magic field" of half-empty, Wicken's bright and dark heart pounces and bounces, but can only be difficult from Douglas, Silver In the shackles of the gods and legendary peaks such as the "Hell of the Hell" and the Empress Queen, the "water liquid" is absorbed and slowly grows larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the changes in the opening of the Aringe lock are clearly reflected in his "heart" that seems to be everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer waiting for a better chance! When the road to Xi'an joins the battle group, there is no chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken’s “heart” suddenly protrudes into a dark and imaginary blood vessel, which seems to pass through the “water solution” without blocking. The tide of the composition was tied to the Elf Queen Aglesia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aglia has not paid much attention to this, there is the protection of the elves, and the struggle of Viken’s one percent strength is not natural. breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, her body suddenly highlighted a dark shadow with strong hatred and pain, completely out of her control ", took the "blood vessel"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aglia’s heart exclaimed and found that the “container” on which he had completed the ancient devil’s state was out of control, that is, his own “old devil half body”. And this is equivalent to her own out of control! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken has such a strong control over the existence of all ancient devils? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she only feels that Wicken in front is "sublime sacred" and can't help but want to pay homage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Viken’s “heart” has extended several black blood vessels and plunged into the body of legendary peaks such as Berkovsky. , madly absorbed their "old devil half body." Only a few people such as Fernando and Hathaway did not have this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the moments, a negative emotion, a little black shadow debris, along the "blood vessels" into the "Vicken's heart", Douglas, "Silver Moon "And the Lord of Hell" wants to rescue, but can't abandon his own shackles of the tide, can only watch this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning, the law of the gods published by Viken actually contained such a serious flaw! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is a complete, not trapped, god-like method. Defects and hidden dangers are inevitable products. Even Viking can't avoid it, so people can believe it. Only at this time, He is the most powerful ancient devil, so he is unscrupulous, so he was initially unwilling. Disclosed to the Northern Church. Because of the power of faith and the accumulation of divine glory, the Pope Bilkovsky may break through to the gods in a short time and form a balance with Him so that He cannot exert this control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the long-term, the tides re-emerged into the "Vicken's Heart" and let him absorb it madly, and for every drop, This advantage is more powerful. In just a few moments, the "heart" changed length and vaguely revealed the figure of Viken. At this time, Lucien just flashed into the sky, ready to enter the "magic field" to prevent Viking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Wicken suddenly burst into laughter: "You come too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gleaming blood vessel stretched out and plunged directly into Rudolf II, who also worked hard on the periphery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rudolph II looked at Viken with horror, and the golden, light, and kind golden shadows of the body continued to flash. With a clear breath of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tanos, I can't think of you being able to come back to life, but now, you can only be my nutrient!" Wicken's crazy voice sounds far away "You originally hid well, but the time when Mecantelon was resurrected made me doubt! The reason why I didn't expose it was to wait for this opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tanos? The magicians below are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II can't even speak, and his body is quickly dimmed. The hair turned white, and the golden shadows shattered into pieces, flowing into the body of Wicken along the "blood vessels." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent roar and the boundless ray of light broke out, letting you just enter the "magic field." Lucien, who was ready to take out, had to go one step back. In the mental field, Vicken’s breath disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light slowly dissipated, and the legendary peaks such as Elf Queen, Berkovsky, and Rudolf II were no longer able to maintain themselves, and they fell out of the magic "The field", falling to the ground, for a time, they even lost their basic ability to control their own flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately there are many legendary powerhouses outside, there are elves, there are northern churches, and there are holy Helz empire, they are not the first The legendary peak of the physical fall - they are not real epic knights, the flesh can not afford that kind of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fading of the light, the central scene is revealed in the senses of Lucien, Douglas, and "Silver Moon", and Wicken hair turns black. The wrinkles disappeared, the eyes were dark and deep, and a pair of thirty-year-old looks like only the nose slightly squirmed, slightly cloudy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a person, Lu Xien and Douglas and other strong people have seen, it is a portrait of the "disaster king" that has been seen in many magic books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the side of Viken, a holy angel, an evil devil, entangled with each other, worshipped Him, feared Him, praised Him, praised Him Formed a field where paradise and hell live in harmony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This field does not seem to be in this world. Lucien and Douglas and other gods can see the scene, hear the song and praise, but they can’t feel it. It and the atmosphere of Viken inside, can not touch their existence, as if in front of a holographic projection, the real people are far from the horizon, far away from another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken smiled as he adjusted his situation: "Evans, it’s a pity, are you late, is it very unexpected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is soft and soft, and can be heard in the surrounding legendary strong, under the ears of magicians, nobles and ordinary civilians, but like the thunder of the flat, shaking their bodies ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a delay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has He become a true God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete, everything is over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of despair begins to spread, but more people There is still a glimmer of hope. There are a whole four gods on our side. Even if we can't beat it, we should be able to maintain the situation and prevent him from doing whatever he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas, Etna, Maldives, the three gods are more and more dignified, because they can’t judge the depth of Wicken, of course . They did not give up and continued to attack Viking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Moon is a dream, hell is falling, evil, the fate of the meteor flashes away, and Qi Qi hits Wicken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to be shocked excessively, without attack, but slightly nodded: "Your god of the law has such a serious flaw, which makes me very Accident. So I am one step late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, one step behind is the boundary between life and death. Now I am already a true God, you can't beat me at all." No, you may not even attack me!" Wicken smiled slyly and saw that the glory of Silver Moon penetrated the past. The eruption of hell penetrated the past, and the fate of the meteor penetrated the past, just like there was nothing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singing and praise of angels and devils are still lingering, not interrupted, and the magicians are more desperate, even the attacks can not be attacked? This power gap is simply the distance between heaven and the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See it, this is the true God. I can appear anywhere at any time, attack anyone at any time, but you can't break the boundaries between God and mortal, touch Not my true body." Wicken moved his head and seemed to finally control this state. "I will stand here for you to play, and it will have no effect."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true God, He is really the god... A magician, aristocrat and civilian look at this scene, the body begins to soften, it seems that their feet are unable to bear their weight. This is really a desperate opponent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will He deal with us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicken smiled and said: "I don't need you anymore, you all disappeared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, He is about to start attacking, his face The "muscles" suddenly jumped, as if something was going out underneath, such a bulge, all over the place where he was exposed, and then. Even the robes that his power became have such a bulging beating, and the extra disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Viken was horrified and trying to control himself. Douglas, Silvermoon, and Lord of Hell did not understand what happened. But know that this is a rare opportunity. Go all out to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their attacks still cannot break the "the boundary between God and mortal"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's body gradually becomes transparent, bright and dark, with a smart face in the body, a face with a sincere or painful face. Shocked outwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this! Why is this happening?" Viken screamed in horror and anger, listening to the legendary powerhouse and the magicians below. What is the truth about "God"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken stared at Lucien, who had been quiet and did not do anything, and said to himself: "I have gathered the power of everyone to become a strong observer. Why is this still the case? Why is this still happening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Heidi and others are white, and the observer’s observer effect speculation has fostered such a fundamental Unbeatable opponent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Viken, but he said it was expressionless but the tone was a bit raised: "Observer effect?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he evoked his mouth, gently and slightly smiled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat yours!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheat yours? The magician, such as Annick, had a big mouth and couldn't close it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheat yours? Douglas, "Silver Moon", Fernando and others can't control themselves to "see" to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheat yours? Viken's body swayed violently, and the faces seemed to be torn apart, and the eyes were first and foremost, followed by endless anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien keeps smiling: "The true and magical nature of the world is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His expression suddenly became solemn, and the void behind it began to oscillate, showing a vast expanse of stars, the stars and the closer and closer, the angle of view is getting lower and lower, let everyone see the huge fireball and the azure planet they had witnessed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the secret of immortality, the truth of the world, and the essence of magic!" Lucien said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his right hand stretched out and stroked in the air, and immediately surrounded by a series of complex formulas like a stereoscopic live screen, even if Douglas saw it, he also endured Can't live dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a mathematical model that describes the space." Lucien actually did not have the opportunity to control himself by joining Wicken, but introduced these formulas. This makes the magical parliament's arcanes feel extraordinarily weird. This kind of intense battle, how does Evans do this? Didn't he see the inability to break the boundaries between God and man, and instead look for the head of Viken? If this can be successful, it is unprecedented, and there should be no examples of combat in the future...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous theory of relativity was 3+1 dimensional space-time. This is a model that describes multidimensionality.” Lucien did not elaborate on it, because the premise and hypothesis of this mathematical model can be said to be a small half-day, and almost no one can understand it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was in the midst of the air, slow, strolling and walking towards relying on "the boundary between God and man" to try to control his own Viken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this model, we can assume that the universe we exist is a high-dimensional universe. Its projection in different three-dimensional spaces forms parallel universes. "Lushine is like saying something to Heidi and others, "Speaking in a sentence, "Mathematics tells us that in three-dimensional, four-dimensional, or even higher-dimensional states, the universe can hardly intersect. That is, we overlap each other. I can't touch the other person and can't sense each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien's tone is very gentle, just like lectures, just like chatting, but at this time, the sky suddenly darkened, and a gust of wind whistled, blowing through the ground and blowing into the "magic field." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas and others continue to attack Viken. While listening to Lucian's words, this seems to explain a lot of experimental phenomena and more fully interpret the transition from microscopic to macroscopic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world around Wicken made the world of the devils sing and sing, so that he can concentrate on controlling himself. Trying to get rid of the embarrassment of the proliferation of countless face conflicts, and Lucian’s words, he is half-understood, as if he understood something, and did not know what it was. Of course, his eyes glared at Lucien’s eyes without any change. Even if I am cheated, I have the strength of the true God. When I control myself a little, I will kill you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice gradually became louder: “This model is such a transition from the microscopic domain to the macroscopic world, but we will find the location of magic? Position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, in this model, there are two hypothetical premise, one is that the soul does exist, the essence is high-dimensional things, can be distributed Special electromagnetic waves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunder in the air, but there was no lightning, as if the world was obstructing Lucian’s remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a high-dimensional thing, the soul will also be projected in different parallel universes, but because of the different dimensions of the dimensions, there will be some differences in this projection, such as In the parallel universe, the existence of the soul is extremely weak, and it is almost impossible to detect the electromagnetic wave. In some universes, the soul can walk directly on the earth, and the electromagnetic waves emitted are very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another thunder sounded, the sky was dark, like a rainstorm, but lightning still did not appear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned a deaf ear to Ray, still step by step toward Viken: "Of course, if there is only this premise, then most of the souls of some powerful creatures appear." "Psychic communication", moving things, igniting firewood, etc. Based on the special and simple special ability of special electromagnetic waves, that is, the most common extraordinary power, there will be no strange magic, there will not be all kinds of strange creatures, so Another assumption is that another parallel universe has a preliminary coupling or intersection with our universe because of something we are not yet clear about!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning is like a group of silver snakes, illuminating the sky, illuminating the world, and the people around Viking sings and praises him. The voice of the angel and the devil gradually became smaller, and Viken once again showed a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silver-spark-like lightning, a universe that resembles the starry sky behind Lucien appears, just when Lucien was promoted, everyone The strange taste that I felt was spreading again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice is violently elevated, grand and solemn: “So the entanglement of microscopic particles and the underlying world is an order of magnitude stronger than normal!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, in quantum erase experiments and delayed selection experiments, the state of coherent entanglement is more difficult to destroy than normal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is constantly lightning, the rainstorm is falling, the whole world is welcoming this rainstorm that can drown the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of coherence is strong in the microscopic field. Compared with the macro world, it is simply unremarkable. With the macro join, it will still be easily destroyed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the macro world is real and material, there is no illusory state, but the entire underlying foundation is therefore not strong!" Lucien continues to move forward In one step, the sound is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the angels and demons around Wicken have been quiet. No more singing and praise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under normal circumstances, this weakness will not have any effect, but in special occasions, such as biological derivation, there will be many more mutations than normal. So, we have such a rich species. So many powerful Warcraft!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien stepped loudly and loudly: "So. The 'spiritual power' of our soul can develop so many different and different spells beyond the monotonous ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The angels and devils around Wicken, the face began to appear fearful expression, Douglas gave up the attack, and listened to Lucian's remarks, Wicken is more and more desperate and crazy state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our source of energy is indeed the undulating energy of the sea, but it is not our universe, because of the ups and downs of that moment, we can't grasp it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the two parallel universes have an intersection and the inconsistency of time and space changes, we give us the opportunity to use the other materials such as the sea and virtual particles!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energy and other conservation are the conservation of two universes, not our single universe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu Xien described it sentence by sentence. The ordinary people and nobles on the ground have completely lost their minds. They don’t even know what he is saying, even if it’s the legendary powerhouse in the air, and most of them are in this state. Only the arcane masters are half-hearted and listening. Some people fly and dance, some people tremble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The existence of the soul is high dimensional. It will be projected in each parallel universe, our own soul is only one of the essence, so our meditation is through two The connection of the soul projection. Inducting another universe, the meditation environment we established, that is, the cognitive world, is the channel for communicating with the universe. Therefore, the more similar it is, the closer it is, and the deeper the coupling, the more More powerful, this is the feedback of the real world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the essence of most of our spell models is the mathematical model of this spatiotemporal communication with changes in different responses. The more precise, the stronger the nature!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of god that can be smashed by the "Abyss Will" blew, the darkness of the sky and the "big fireball" coexist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bounds between God and the mortal" around Wicken is like a huge pressure that feels awkward and illusory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this model, gravity is quantized and exists as a lower-latitude thing. When the two universes intersect, it Will be entangled with the gravity of our world, so there is a 'fog' that wraps the planet, a 'fog' that wraps the sun, a gravitational tomb with no gravity, and a lot of different space, so we don’t consider other cosmic influences, There is no way to find the planet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why the previous planet could never be found!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I said this, Lucien’s mind suddenly showed the scene when she first saw the journal of Arcane. At that time, Oliver and the Speaker of the House were deeply troubled by the inability to discover the planet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing power... Douglas calmed down and fell into thought! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragic crying sounded, the angels and devils around Viking were afraid, or the light or tears flowed out, "the boundary between God and man" swayed more and more Severe, the snoring is getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's face flies out, turning into a blue smoke, and his expression is getting more and more crazy and hateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul is high-dimensional, so our death just eliminates this projection, losing the current memory and special fluctuations, but the actual soul is not After dying, it will be re-projected after a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words of Lucien, the rainy face highlights a piece of soul face, they Cried, cursed, and threatened, and the ordinary people below shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, some of our spells and extraordinary abilities have some kind of high-dimensional features, so that we can have no time interval by means of fate and so on. Resurrection', the sword of truth can directly kill all traces of existence, eliminate the blood to break the connection between the two universes, eliminate the source of magic, magic, etc.!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
