			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, is Tucker moving?" I was asked a middle-aged woman in front of a woman's charming "Lando". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the proximity to the mine, the sky in Holsava City seems to be covered with dust for years, dark and dark, and his location is a dark alley Central, the style of the building is clearly biased towards the mysterious and gloomy that the magicians like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman asked by Fernando is an ordinary person, timid and shrinking: "Yes, the magician, more than a month ago, Tucker Moved away from here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respect and fear of the magician was deeply engraved in the blood of the civilians of the magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked around here, the cold and heavy buildings were mottled and outdated, and the traces of the run-down could be seen everywhere, while the heart of the road seemed to pass. Not good, while continuing to ask: "Do you know where he moved? How many days ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged women thought about it with fear "The magician is an adult. It was raining that day. I remember it more clearly, just the day of the month in the middle of last month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the ancient magician on the date The rules are detailed and complicated, such as the bronze moon Tanos Day in the winter, but the ordinary people remember the complicated things, the most used one to twelve and a few special month names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently daggers, the magic of the secret tells him that if there is no interference, this middle-aged woman is not a hidden high-level magician, her words can be true Letter, and the second point, he has confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman nodded in front of the beautiful girl in front of her, and her heart relaxed a little and her words were smoother: "Mr. Tucker is a magician who does not talk." I basically stayed in the room to do experiments every day, but a few days ago, I met him in the hall and heard him say to himself, 'Coffrey', 'The new life will start from there' these words." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a nearby civilian and was later hired as a servant of Cook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coffrey..." Fernando repeated the name and quickly found the corresponding place on the map in memory. It is a city in the northwest of Aalto. It is located at the junction of the magician's forces and the dozens of different religious churches that resist the Truth. There is no rich mineral deposits and unique resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Tucker do there? Doubt in the heart of Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he was slightly divined for a moment, determined that there was no obvious danger, decided to go there to see, by the way, quietly observe the church of the different gods, he has always been the form of the existence of the gods Why the church is curious about developing beliefs and other things. Unfortunately, in the Holm area, the Truth is so strong, and he has the opportunity to observe and study. Since this time to Aalto, let's take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fulfilling this wish, return to Aalto, along with the magicians recruited by Beatty, Loewa, and their companions. Back to the Holm area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fran this chick is really hot enough to taste, but unfortunately can't stay with her for a while." Fernando thought with a little regret, and then secretly guilty. "But if she knows my true identity, she will definitely go crazy and leave early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the "death lord" makes the legendary lord pay attention, then Communication with the Holm area will certainly become more frequent. When the old fox comes to the messenger I sent, Fernando Barabara, it will be troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coffrey City. A commercial city in the era of magical empire, even now, has a very large population, and does not know how many times more prosperous than the mining city of Holsava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is shining, Fernando looks down from the city in the air, seeing pedestrians like ants, towering towers, not unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his height and landed outside the city gate. He did not try to challenge the city’s defensive array, and then crossed the door by relying on the tokens given by Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magical array of cities has been running at this level?" Fernando guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street, the residents of Kufrey seem to be familiar with each other. Fernando often sees five or six or more people coming together and whispering something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Fernando was wary, quietly giving himself a spell that was unobtrusive, and then relied on the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you go to the priest tonight, he will pray for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am sure to go, I have to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar words have been drilled Fernando's ears are nothing special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando grinned: "It seems to be too close to the church of the gods, and they have developed believers, hey, always better than faith in the truth."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened to several places one after another, did not find strange places, so he went straight to the "Mage's official residence" in the center of the city, and learned the whereabouts of Tucker from the staff there - according to the magic The empire stipulates that only the local "Mage's official residence" can register and enjoy the privileges of the magician, such as subsidies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for him to leave with satisfaction from the "Mage Officials", and Tucker did come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still worried that he is studying as a madman, and I don’t know where to go." Fernando groaned and walked to the 24th Street at right angle according to the information. Go, there is the residence that Tucker got. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right-angle street is located near the city wall, and the light is faint. It is similar to the scene after the dust of Holsava City. The same darkness and gloom, the houses are also dilapidated. It’s been a long time since it’s not repaired – as long as it’s not your own magic tower, the magicians are too lazy to waste their spells and energy to fix them. In their words, raising the civilians is just for doing this kind of thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tuk is also crowded out here? But he didn't come long." Fernando said to himself, suspecting the impact of Beto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he believes that it is not Beto directly, otherwise Tucker has long disappeared, but Beto’s hate will follow him from his circle. The mouth of the person came out and slowly spread to other cities, so some people would deliberately please. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando parked on the first floor of a two-storey villa without a garden, knocking at the door casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This villa is so old that there are no ordinary magical doorbells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few sounds, there was no movement inside, even the usual magical pets or alchemy dolls did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tuk is not?" Fernando muttered, it was unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to knock on the door again, this time harder, trying to make a bigger noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚,吱呀......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Fernando’s movement, the door slowly opened. It didn't really close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has a faint hunch, but thinks that Tucker is just a magician who has just been promoted to the ranks, so the artisans boldly released the secret law. Eye, let it fly into the villa, and investigate every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tables and chairs in the villa have accumulated a thin layer of dust. No matter whether it is downstairs or downstairs, there are no traces of living beings, and there is no special Secret door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are notes in the study room, and there are materials in the lab... Is Tucker rushing away when preparing for the experiment?" Fernando speculated based on the feedback from the secret eye. "It may not be left, but it is missing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise a magician would not let his magic notes be placed in the study without carrying carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
