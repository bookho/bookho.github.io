			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has just ignited a constant "electromagnetic communication" of the monocle, and before he even had to call the other side of Gaston, Lucien suddenly felt strong magical fluctuations. Appeared, the subconsciously cast magic, the crystal ball of the morning light that was picked up in the left hand became clear and clear, and quickly flew up like a sun around the head of Lucian, and there were twelve dragonflies around it like a night star. The stars run around the crystal ball in different trajectories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatigue response of the Charlotte recovery has been slower than the half-shooting of Lucien, and the illusory force field is condensed and blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan, who is not far from Sandra, is completely confused. She doesn’t know what to do. She watched Sandra’s chest burst into a small electric light. The entangled light reflected that he did not know when to drill into the black gas, and quickly cleaned them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the ground in front of Sandra, the slamming sounds were a few cracks, and a few pieces of metal became dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster is still not dead! It is still in this castle!" Sandra’s voice was slightly sharp, with a faint horror, "If not I have A good talisman, just controlled by this monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her purple magic robe conservatively closed neckline seems to be broken by what powerful force, A severely deformed can't see the original pattern of the talisman chain disconnected. In the eyes of Lucian and others, the slow motion falls to the ground as clearly and inconspicuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two fierce battles, most of the mental energy consumption, all the magic that is good at it is exposed, the monster that is strange to the extreme has not died yet! This made the battle-savvy Sandra also have to be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the "Maskillin Star" is running, Lucien looked around with vigilance and shouted twice: "Mr. Gaston! Gaston Mr.!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Electromagnetic communication" is still silent, no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Charlotte cast a "secondary mind connection", the three magicians and a magic apprentice's soul are connected together, lest It is a waste of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's run, flee! The monster is too horrible, we will never kill!" As a magic apprentice, Susan has supported Can't stop, crying all over the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, after so many dangers, developed the more dangerous and calmer qualities, and there was indeed a lot of suspicion just now, so it was not Susan fear and Sandra's slight panic, quickly shared their views: "We just thought it was the monster that Mr. Bertrand summoned, and used the brazier as the main medium of the summoning ceremony. Now it seems wrong, leaving the brazier The medium, the monster still exists. And Mr. Bertrand is a magician who grew up in archaeology education from an early age, obviously will not try the ridiculous summoning ceremony. The summoner must have someone else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bill? Only he is still alive in the castle. This monster is terrifying and strange. It is impossible to find him hiding in the secret room." Charlotte's voice was exhausted. Sandra subconsciously retorted: "Impossible, I used the charm of human control to verify the intelligence. And so, the monster has enough ability to help him shield the part." Memory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to his familiar companion, Susan stopped crying and was completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just listened to Susan, because there is no arcane talent, Bill has been bullied by other magic apprentices. Similar children’s hearts are definitely full of hatred and tyranny. Emotions. When these emotions accumulate to the critical point, they will begin to seek revenge. At this time, there is not much Arc-based Bill, and it is very likely to follow the absurd summoning ceremony, regardless of the formal magician and the subject. How ridiculous and ridiculous in the eyes of a well-educated magic apprentice.” Lucian calmly analyzed, then turned to look at Susan and asked her through a spiritual connection. “Susan, you have seen Bill see.” Suspicion of Allegory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan first shook his head in confusion and then became scared to wake up: "Bill, Bill has been watching "Fable Allegory" recently, saying Yes, it is said to draw strength from pain and learn arcane more painstakingly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now Bill swindled himself and waited for someone to come to the bondage, apparently to get more recovery time for the monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magicians once again ran to the apprentice hall according to the previous formation, and they were a few meters away from each other. Susan whipped up the final strength and struggled. Followed by Sandra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the running, Lucian’s heart has other doubts, such as why the monster is really condensing from the brazier when he or she opens the bondage room. Instead of resurrecting through the media of Bill, etc., it can be urgent, only temporarily press them down, first solve the imminent monster and say it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no similar time to ask Bill to delay, this time the monster has obviously not recovered, otherwise it will not just try to control Sandra with domination. At this point, the corridor that turned around was quiet, there was no pale and transparent arm, and there was no bloody red tongue, so that Lucien and others rushed back to the apprentice hall in a few seconds, rushing past the row that had just been knocked down. The bookshelf returned to the location of the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bronze statue. Two dead-like eyes are twisting and getting bigger. One eye on the wall of the room and the nearby wall is trying to highlight. It is black eyeball, white pupil, unusually strange and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien and others were slightly relieved, and even the wall of evil eyes could not be condensed, indicating that they did not fall back. Time, not as much as before, let the monster recover most of the power, and that the monster inside is in a very weak stage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few ideas in the mind connection quickly communicated, Lucien handed a push, a red fireball that seemed to compress the power of terror into it and flew Go out and go straight to the door of the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the opposite side of the wall of evil eyes has appeared the "gaze of the gaze" cast by Charlotte, allowing one eye to be clearly visible through the mirror See yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, the mirror is broken, and the wall of the evil eye has not completely condensed and collapsed, letting Lucien’s fireball directly hit the door of the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the huge explosion, the magical defense of the chamber is not too strong, and the stone door is blown apart and the smoke is filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sandra purple magic wand immediately followed, "The Light of Mystery" will make the chamber and its surroundings extremely bright. It absorbs all the light in the vicinity, shines through the diffuse smoke, and shines out Bill in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill’s eyes with black-rimmed glasses glared at Lucian and others with unusual hatred and disgusting expression, but his face was distorted. A strange and inexplicable smile, the muscles of the body picked up, the system apprentices broke, the skin was broken, revealing bloody muscles and blood vessels, a white aphid crawling inside, some even from Bill mouth The nose, the corners of the eyes and the ears were drilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bill? You!" Ben has summoned the monster but has no ability to control it. You can see this scene. Susan only feels astonished than she imagined. The monster is Bill himself? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the surface of Bill appeared a transparent wall, there are countless black strange magic runes in it. He laughed happily and happily: "The group slaps me, always ridiculously when my bastards are dead in my hands, it is such a panic, that despair, that kind of cowardice, there is no such thing as a magical test. I am arrogant and powerful when I step on my feet. They are very strong in appearance, but they are like mice in the heart. Look, only the power from the heart is really powerful, I got strength from pain and successfully awakened my heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words seem to come from everyone's heart, and Susan and others understand what he meant in a short moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two white lights flashed in the transparent wall in front of Bill, letting a magical rune collapse. Both Charlotte and Sandra didn't waste time talking to Bill and directly cast a three-ring force field magic "Remove Magic", which has a chance to dispel a magical effect or a defensive field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the top of the road to the top of the Maskillin star has three stars off track, and the other three hit together, bursting with dazzling brilliance This allows Charlotte and Sandra to get a "lucky" blessing, which will maximize the effect of dispelling magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bill seems to hear her voice, laughing happily: "That is not the devil, that summons our own hidden spiritual power! Awkwardness, jealousy, hatred, greed is a wonderful taste!" His lips fell off White teeth, the eyes are gradually reddish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "de-magic" white light flashed, the transparent wall in front of Bill quickly disintegrated, and his current strength could not be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layer of transparent force field has just disappeared, Charlotte and Sandra have each inspired an item, and once again in the buffer of their own magic, "released" magic"! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill’s first layer of black light disappeared with Charlotte’s magical effect, and then a black cloud emerged under Sandra’s magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien’s right hand, the lilac light bursts, like a little purple sun, Bill suddenly appears gold, silver, black, White, purple and other light spots of various colors, they began to spin rapidly around the center of Bill, like the most horrible vortex, crazy tearing Bill's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the monster can act as a purely conscious or spiritual body, but Bill has a flesh and is subject to elemental restrictions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not wait for the last minute to provoke the "element vortex", as long as the opportunity is right, he did not hesitate to use it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex is getting bigger and bigger, the light spot is getting brighter and brighter, and Bill is completely covered in it, completely filling the chamber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart is as painful as a suffocating heart, the soul is extremely weak, the spirit is also abnormally distracted, and the headache is like a split, even after the fierce battle, the “Elemental Swirl” is used. Let him be more serious than the last sequelae. He has no ability to open his mouth and talk. He can only lean obliquely against the bookshelf. At this time, Charlotte moves over and protects Lucien according to the communication of the intimate connection. At the same time, the hand of the user gave him the "Song of Water" magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra is concentrating on Bill, or guarding against the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex slowly disappeared, and the entire chamber was completely damaged and disappeared by the wall. There are several large holes in the ground, and the hall below can be clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill's location has a black trace of black corrosion, but nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kill the monster?" Sandra asked some unbelievably, subconsciously looking out the window, only to see the fog disappear completely, showing the evening soon Falling sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether or not it is killed, since the opportunity comes out, we will contact Mr. Gaston." Sweet and sweet light blue "Song of Water" After taking it, Lucien felt as if he had regained his strength, but he still had a feeling of abnormal pain when he used his mental strength. Forcibly supported and stimulated "electromagnetic communication." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Song of Water" is the best recovery agent in the middle class, able to restore life and spirit at the same time, but Lucien is still using the anti-phagic symptoms Existence can only force the item, and it is impossible to cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello, Mr. Gaston?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief silence, the opposite sounds Gaston had a northerly accent and a slightly old voice: "Lu Xien, have trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, meet one Monsters..." Lucien told the story shortly, and the tension in his heart relaxed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Gaston, he silently said: "You are looking for a stable room to arrange the magic array, and there are recent high-orders after twenty minutes. The magician came over and dealt with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the news of the support, everyone was relieved a lot, Charlotte helped Lucien, Sandra with Susan Go to the energy of another corridor in the apprentice hall and prepare to wait there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, do you still have questions?" Charlotte saw Lucien's brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded. "There are still many things I don't understand, such as why do monsters attack Sandra before recovery? Let us be alert and react. If it is not restored, it is not so easy to kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
