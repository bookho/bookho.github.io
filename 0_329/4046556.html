			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the quill and drew two lines on the paper: "First, I admit that this relative system is still not perfect, it can not explain The surname can only be confined to the uniform reference frame and cannot be extended to the accelerated reference frame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, just about the question you asked, within this framework It can be seen that it is not a flaw. This is the timeline of the two brothers. We analyze it separately: if the brother wants to fly away at the speed of light, there will inevitably be an acceleration from rest to final speed. This process can not be ignored, and if he wants to return, there will also be a reverse acceleration process, which needs to overcome the habit of surname, and can not be ignored... And by the principle of relative surname, the younger brother did not overcome the process of habitual surname..." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While analyzing, Lucien assumes that the data is calculated, originally introduced general relativity, interprets the habit and gravity, and derives the time variation of the acceleration process, which is the most convenient and simple. Way, but Lucien now has no way to do this Do, only slightly after the introduction of the concept, a detailed analysis of each time line, then the integral calculation time path knowledge to obtain the results. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "...... So, my brother would be a little younger than his brother, to be exact, his body changes are slowed down ......" Lucien made a conclusion . <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Oliver rubbed his quill pen, carefully look at the calculation of Lucien, remembering his analysis, and finally nodded his head: "I consider enough perfect, ignoring the acceleration, deceleration process, however, if my brother does not return, straight ahead, wandering in the sky, it reached a steady speed and his younger brother, who "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has no practical meaning. If my brother does not return and does not meet his brother, they are in different reference systems and cannot compare, as in two completely unrelated worlds. Like people, they have their own lives and have their own rules, which can be irrelevant to each other.” Lucien laughed and pointed at the air path next to him. “Maybe there is such a real material world around us, it is with Our worlds overlap, but they have no influence on each other. They meet each other without any hindrance. Maybe in that world, in this place, someone is holding a lively dance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fees Nando didn't feel that there was a problem with Lu Xien's explanation. Instead, he heard the less rigorous example he took with him. He said: "This is a very strange idea. If there is such a world, then we Research on time and space or other similar fields is still in its infancy, and it is hard to imagine that this world, which is also composed of substances and overlaps each other, will have no effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly shook his head: "This is just my idea of ​​divergent surname, the teacher does not have to care, it has no theoretical basis and practical significance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Just now, Lu Xien said some of the contents of a time and space view in the soul library, but this is an unconfirmed conjecture, based on the extension of quantum theory, nor is it favored by mainstream books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we discuss the next question..." Oliver spoke again. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long exchange, in the case of the relativistic effect of accelerated particles, Oliver initially accepted the system, but also with Lucien, Fernando Consensus, this is still an imperfect theory, and there are still many shortcomings. For example, according to it, the artificial planet should be slower than the ground. It can be inferred from the specific data and the adjusted communication quality. fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I have finally taken a solid step on this road. I have a hunch that this will be a major change in the macro field and needs to be carefully guided. Other Arcanists, oh, Lucien, you have outstanding ability in the micro and macro fields. In the future, the legendary career may be difficult to choose. Others are unable to find and build a legendary career suitable for their own cognitive world. And you are confused about how to choose, it is really embarrassing." Oliver eloquently expressed his praise, "I will submit the transformation equations as soon as possible, and strive to catch up with the "Arcane" at the beginning of the month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has always been cautious about this issue, all based on experimental results and specific phenomena, do not pretend not to care, who knows the end of research, relativity Will the system and the quantum mechanics system suddenly have a pattern that is inconsistent with the laws of the world? Souls, spiritual power, spatial barriers, world feedback, spell models and other things remind Lucian all the time, this is one And Earth look the same but the big difference is likely to occur in the critical infrastructure in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the relationship with Natasha, Lucien has a more detailed analysis of his future path, and is prepared to adopt a more conservative attitude. After all, he is no longer a person, and this attitude is in the cognitive world. In the construction of the quantum mechanics, supplemented by the theory of relativity, ready to modify the theory of relativity according to quantum mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in Lucien’s view, quantum mechanics is the only possibility to explain why there are many constants in the two worlds but there are differences in magic, mental power, blood fusion, etc. Theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If betting, Lucien is more inclined to quantum mechanics than general relativity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the gravitational indulgence and time lag that inevitably brought about by general relativity are all that Canonen cannot give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the new alchemy is not perfect, the construction of the legendary profession still can't see the shadow, I don't think so much for the time being." Lucien guessed it appeared The legendary occupation should be "atomic control", which can reduce the requirements for the study of "fission" and "fusion". Maybe "atomic fission" and "eternal blaze" are the basic magic of this profession, just like half. The "Live God of the Lich" and the "Soul Imprisonment" of the Lich of the Lich, the same as the "elemental decomposition" of Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not say anything in this regard, the topic turned: "Mr. Oliver, I heard that you are studying the Dark Dragon God, do not know what to gain ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien submitted the "Report of the Change of Surname of El God", which is a leader in this field, Oliver did not conceal, directly: "The problem is very big. When the Dark Dragon God leaves his own alien space and enters the main material world, the name of the god will decay. It seems that the power of faith is difficult to penetrate the space barrier and bless him, so the source is greatly Lowering, can only consume the previous accumulation, and the reason why several pseudo-sacred countries near the dark mountains are less open and occupied, I think there are reasons for this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why is the truth of God not affected? Is this the difference between the false god and the true God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say it is true God, Oliver also There is nothing to fear the line, God is just a noun to him, and belongs to the object of research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not quite understand what was going on, and he recorded the troubles Oliver said after he recorded the magic notebook, and he was ready to leave the "Thunder Hell" and go to The Panel applies for information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, wait a minute." Oliver suddenly called Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Oliver doubtfully, he was not familiar with him, what else can he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver laughed and said: "I made some mistakes recently, so I plan to write an opera to apologize to Florence, Evans is the best musician. I hope to be able to work with you. The melody and songs of the previous operas are really difficult to satisfy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take time to try." Lucy En did not refuse, but to deepen his relationship with Oliver. One supporter in the highest ranking group is better than one enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien intends to write an opera to Natasha as a gift in the commemoration of next year, although there is a soul library reference, but this time he intends Make a big adaptation, after all, it is better to give a gift to your sweetheart, but it is more sincere, so I just asked Oliver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver got a positive answer and left with satisfaction, and agreed to send the script to Lucien in a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his back disappeared, Fernando snorted: "One day he will die on a woman, I doubt when Florence will endure If you don't live, he will fall asleep and give him a fatal blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magician is so easy to be killed..." Lucien is not worried about Oliver. Security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando didn’t say anything more, turned to look at Lucien: "You and Natasha have decided the relationship, don’t tell others, things. Need to take your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s not hard to guess that Natasha was celebrating the birth of Lucien last night, she was in the early hours of the morning. Just leaving, it is still impossible to know the extent to which the relationship is specific, and Lucien’s whereabouts are deliberately exposed, otherwise it can be returned with a deformed mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
