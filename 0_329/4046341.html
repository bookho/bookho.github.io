At the same time, because it cannot be rigorously deduced into other illusion fields, and it lacks multiple evidences of determining surnames and logics, it is difficult to judge the importance of controversial surnames and discussion of surnames. It is recommended to reward twenty-five arcane points and three hundred arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Combining the results of the two members' consistent assessment, Lucien? Evans's evaluation of this paper is: the brain wave, the human body alchemy material, the creation of the surname in the field of hallucinations, the breakthrough of the surname, the extremely discussion of the surname, there is a certain degree of importance, and it is temporarily impossible to generalize to other areas of illusion. The paper is clear in logic, rigorous in experimental design, and accurate in magic analysis, but many important places are ambiguous, rewarding twenty-eight points for arcane points and three hundred arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; To the conclusion of such an audit, Lucien couldn't help but smile, although the members of the illusion field did not seem to like such a paper, and the reward for the Arcane points was low, but their first semi-original surname paper would take It is very good to go to the three second level evaluations. Strictly speaking, this is the right direction. It is natural to create a surname and a very high-profile discussion. The surname is to link the application of brain waves in illusion with the specific magic structure, and to part of the illusion. The arcane system is included in a strict sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric saw Lucien smile without seeing the haze, and this shook his head: "The members of the illusion field are too conservative, do not like you and Iraq. Such a paper by Ms. Sabella, even if it is strictly in accordance with the standard evaluation, the reward points given are the lowest in the range. Normally, you can get at least forty to fifty arcane points in this paper, Isabella The lady’s article is at least eighty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How many arcane points did Ms. Isabella finally receive?” Lucien was psychologically prepared for this. Not so angry, the personal preference of the committee members caused the deviation of the points reward is almost certain, as long as the evaluation words of different levels do not appear "confused", anyway, the arcane points are mainly from the citation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric has a deep connection in the magician management department, knows a lot of things, while keeping a serious old-fashioned expression, while lowering the voice: "Fifty, really Too much, if Ms. Isabella is not a high-level magician, they are likely to give the lowest forty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella belongs to the tower, is six The Arcanist, the seven-ring magician, who specializes in the two factions of the astrology and illusion, can always be the core members of the tower with voting rights without the highest honor in the corresponding field, and cannot be elected to the Arcane Review Committee. Her student is Rachel, whom Lucine has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, it is a bit difficult for Ms. Isabella to get the wizard's laurels." Lucien commented casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s light gray eyes stared at Lucien and found that he had no idea what to say about the wizard’s laurels: “So the winner of the wizard’s laurels has been They are less than a few other awards, and most of them are members of the Wizarding House. The results of their awards are basically small-scale innovations or applications that follow the various theories of the three major factions of the ancient magic empire."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this time, Ms. Isabella’s experiment is very rigorous, all aspects of evidence and magic support are complete, and the logical derivation is strict and error-free. If the Wizard House does not award the laurel to her and bud Cher, I am afraid that the highest honor of the wizard's laurel will become a joke, and will never be taken seriously by other arcans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, the award is also a kind of On the "political" considerations, Lucien shook his head with a funny smile, and later he would take the laurels. What should he start with? It is best not to deviate from your current research direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s always a financial fan and a collection of Lucien, who occasionally thinks about similar problems in a divergent way, but it’s not too serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When I got home, Lucien just handed the hat to the butler Leo and hung it on the coat rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Drummond?" Lucien heard the servant's report, and was a little confused. He didn't know Mr. Drummond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo rushed to the side and whispered: "Master, is the editor of the "Arcane" journal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the editor of the "Arcane" journal! Lucien took a shot and remembered who Drummond was. For every arcane master who is interested in publishing a paper in the journal of Arcane, he is a big man who must remember in his heart. Only Lu Xien, who does not have a place to publish a paper, will forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo replied meticulously like most butlers: "Master, when I give Ivanovsky an assistant, the most important thing to remember is the complicated relationship between each place. So after arriving in Aringe, I have already Mr. Lazar asked about two hundred people who need attention and can provide you with answers at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Lucien praised with satisfaction. This is a good housekeeper, then got up and went out to meet Drummond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drummond wears dark vests and suits, wearing top hats and black canes. The whole person is clear and serious, and the black eyes are as sharp as an eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm dominates the question that you have taught me about the field. It is a rare lord who has achievements in many arcane fields. Evans can be him. The students, I am very happy for you." Drummond did not make a response, and when they met, they used the things dominated by the storm to bring the relationship closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went to court and replied humorously: "Every morning I have to experience a teacher's thinking storm, and time always looks long."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drummond groaned, but immediately understood what the strange phrase "thinking storm" means, so gently smiled: "Not many people are willing to discuss arcane and When the magic problem is left, the storm will dominate your side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked into the living room while they were chilling, and Lucien asked politely: "Mr. Drummond I am honored to visit you. To be honest, when I heard the name, I did not expect it to be you. I should have visited you at the Arcane Journal Headquarters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drummond took the cane forward and said: "I got the news from the audit committee, knowing how you have broken through the surname in terms of how to affect hormone secretion, and introduced electromagnetic theory into the field of illusion. So, take your paper and look at it. It really is a very valuable article. The theme of our next issue of the Arcane Journal is very ambiguous. Right, hormone is the name of Ms. Isabella's body-based alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was originally prepared to send a letter to Evans, but I remember that after you were rejected by our journal staff for more than the terms of reference, we only apologized through Mr. Lavendi and Gaston. Sincerity is not enough, so I will come to visit you directly. First, I apologize for the incident. The staff member has been fired. The second is to face the draft for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Arcane" is the most famous and authoritative journal in the magic world, and its editor-in-chief is directly on the door! This kind of treatment may not be enjoyed by ordinary auditors. This is only the case when competing with the "Magic" journal for the thesis of the legendary magician or the great arcian. Of course, Drummond has to do enough because of the impact of the last incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last apology I have accepted, Mr. Drummond, you don't have to be so grand." Lucien and Drummond sit in the living room Next, and then asked in confusion: "The next issue? The "Arcane" journal has a theme?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I figured out the situation, Lucien He did not agree to the post because of "grateful zero". After all, Mr. Woods of the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" is his old friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isabella's papers have been highly controversial after passing the review. Recently, many high-level arcans have written papers on this. Or do experimental argumentation, or refuted according to theory, so in the next issue of "Arcane", except for the most cutting-edge papers in ten other fields, the rest of the quotas are assigned to this matter, which is the subject of this discussion. To achieve the best results. Evans's article is the most powerful addition and proof to Isabella, hoping to be published in our "Arcane"," Drummond said earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Lucien used the frontier to describe the latest achievements and directions of arcane research on a certain occasion, the term has gradually become widely used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieve the best results? When Lucien heard that Drummond had not disguised it, he quickly understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be that most members of the Supreme Jury are dissatisfied with the fact that the illusion and other factions have long been separated from the Arcane system, bringing the "Witches" and the Owl of the Wizarding House. The barriers of the surgeons, so when Isabella's papers were confirmed, they intended to take this opportunity to create an atmosphere conducive to Isabella and put pressure on conservative wizards. As long as Isabella can get the laurel, it is a great victory for the Arcane, which is equivalent to the Wizards' House disguised to recognize that some illusions can be included in the Arcane system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
