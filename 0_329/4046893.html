			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Secrets Memphis did not care about Lucien’s silent attitude and said to himself: This may be the purpose of Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know my purpose? Lucien picked an eyebrow and smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Duke laughed and said: Before you go to ‘Ancient Hell’, specialize in ‘quiet hell’, not for that special star nucleus? In fact, from the clues I found, the star nucleus was not at this level, but was hid by Tiffidis in a relic of ancient hell, bearing the hope of its resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask Evans to go to the ruins, find the star nucleus, wipe out all the possibilities of the return of Tiffidis, and that star And the ancient hell details I provided are the rewards for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not go by yourself? Since you understand the ancient hell so much, why not personally obliterate the hope of the resurrection of the Owner of Silver White, the only thing that can be done with your own hands. Lucien asked without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis's appearance is a pale and morbid ordinary man. Without the silvery devil's horn and the evil red eyes, it is easy to be When people neglect, it laughs at self-deprecatingly: because the more you understand, the less you dare to enter, fearing to become the carrier of the ancient devils. At least, before the legendary third-order strength, I don’t want to take this danger. Sometimes, the more Ignorance is more daring. When it said this sentence, the eyes swept the old man, as if laughing at him. Ignore, I am afraid that the soul has been merged with the ancient devil. Wandering in the remains of the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devil is real? Lucien asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis smiled and realized that Lucien had already agreed to his request, but he did not want to make a contract, lest there be an emergency in ancient hell. Also consider the issue of fulfilling the contract. Anyway, if the task is completed, the star core will naturally be handed, and no one can steal it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devils, if you think they exist, they do exist. Wandering in the various ruins of ancient hell. Accepting the call from the main material world and all the different spaces, but if you think they don't exist, they really don't exist, more like an outside projection of your own negative emotions. Everyone sees it differently. The memory is different. The strength is different, only the rich negative emotions feel the same. After thinking about it, the Frost Duke organized a language to describe his knowledge of the ancient devil. Therefore, the most important thing is to control your emotions and **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, this should not be dangerous. Your title is 'The Lord of Secrets', good at grasping people's hearts, and definitely have their own emotions and ** Very strong control, and the help of extraordinary power such as 'eternal silence'. Lucien is not aware of the true name of that extraordinary power, so it is replaced by a visually eternal silence that allows the subject to fall into eternal silence without any emotions and **, like a true death. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Frost Duke Memphis sighed: When the ancient devil appeared in the wandering soul, the highest strength could reach the peak of the legend, although not lasting But it is enough to crush me, and, unlike ancient places, as long as there is a little negative emotion, it will be magnified ten times, one hundred times, thousands of times, and the ancient devil sneak into the heart. Seeds are planted, so in ancient hell, there must be no negative emotions, or they will be entangled and difficult to extricate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10x, 100x, 1000x magnification? The black pupil in Lucian’s deep eyes seemed to be slightly brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devils before Lucien came from Douglas and Rhein, who explored the ancient hell relatively smoothly, without negative mood swings, by the ancient devil Attached, and the old man was embarrassed, almost lost, relying on a special legendary item to come out, there is no way to distinguish the situation, so the Duke of Frost said this, Lu Xien is still the first time to hear, very consistent with his own guess ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis put down his own blend of wine and solemnly nodded: In hell, many devils enter the ancient hell adventure in order to gain powerful power, so This is based on hundreds of millions of examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no matter how the devil obeys the order, the heart is also evil and full of **. In the case of insufficient strength, it is difficult not to be affected by the ancient devil. Lucien laughed casually, and he was a big devil in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis Haha laughed: Very correct, so I know that I don’t dare to enter my heart, honestly, after being possessed by the ancient devil, we The devil has no loss, at most, the ** is stronger, the life is short and terrible, but the strength has risen sharply, and this kind of ** is very embarrassing and our ambition and way of thinking, not only will not affect our ability to think. It will make us more wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is called mental illness, and the mental state has improved greatly... Lucien sneaked a secret statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Frost Duke finished laughing, he continued: After entering the ancient hell, except for a few fixed ruins, the environment seen by each intelligent life is different, and in this way In the environment, the wandering soul will be transformed into the loved ones, friends, teachers and students that you value under the control of the ancient devils. It will become the enemy and revenge object you hate, and will perform 'betrayal, killing, suffering and suffering in front of you. Indulge in other scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that this simple illusion scene can't affect the judgment of the legendary magician, but for the ancient devil, they do not expect to enter the ruins. The person is confused by such an illusion, but hopes that the momentary instinctual mood fluctuations, after all, the instinct reaction and its own rational judgment have a certain time difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: Pre-plus magic such as 'Mechanized Mind' can largely circumvent this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the legendary peak, the most important thing is to prevent the ‘the ancient devil’ from being hidden in these illusions. In ancient hell, they can never be killed, constantly reborn, and constantly come, if there is a certain time interval, and the ancient devils at most one of the three 'appears', the legendary peak is also difficult to resist the seven The ancient devil is not afraid of the siege of death. The Duke of Frost spoke of an intelligence that Lucien knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien frowned: Why is there only three ancient devils at a time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his biggest question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know, but I know that the ‘arrogant’ devil is always acting alone because it is the embodiment of ‘arrogance’. same. The ‘hypocrisy’ devil will not join the siege, but habitually secretly sneak attacks. ‘嫉妒’ If the devil acts with other ancient devils, it will become your ‘helper’. The remaining four devils are often ‘appearing’ in twos and threes. There have never been four actions together. Memphis said his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened with interest. Thinking about this issue from this perspective is quite new, and may indeed explain some problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as long as the seven ancient devils are not besieged at the same time, to their own strength. Even if the four big devils are left together, they will have the confidence to leave safely. After all, they can only show the strength of the legendary peak in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the ancient devil does not appear, so that the explorer can enter the ruins normally, get the way to summon them... Memphis will master the ancient hell The information told Lucien in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ninth floor of Hell, Lucien penetrated into the center of the earth along a crack that did not end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it has been down, Lucien finally stepped on the soft, strange soil, and the soil is constantly pulsating, just like the one buried below. heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien held a piece of yellow paper in his hand, which was drawn from the paper of the big devil's skin. The strange patterns that have never been seen, as soon as you see it, seem to see deep negative emotions such as greed, arrogance and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the map provided by Lucifer Duke Memphis to Lucien, the relic of the silver-white Lord Tiffidis, marking the remains of its hidden star nucleus The position, and the old man in the soul field picks up things, prepares to take his wife and Maman, return to the main material world, and go to Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left turn right, Lu Xien breathes, scares off a batch of tyrannical hell smelters, and walks into a deepest hiding in the rift In front of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
