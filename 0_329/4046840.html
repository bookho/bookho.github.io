			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are swaying waves of water, and a strange fish resembles slowly and leisurely. The dark blue has gradually turned to the dark, the sun shining through it. It is difficult to extend deeper, but here is not completely innocent darkness. From time to time, you can see the scaleless fish that shines all over the place and the crab-like sea monsters that hold two colorful lanterns. They will faintly confuse the deep sea, mysterious. gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Doris, Lucien and Natasha sneaked into the depths of the ocean and followed the strange currents that were completely different from others. This is different from the wonders of the shallow sea - the scenery, the pressure of the surrounding water is getting bigger and bigger, it seems that you have to crush yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien was surrounded by a layer of faint light, blocking the sea and pressure, making itself seem to be in another world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha seems to have a small sly sword wandering around, hard to split out a group of "sites" under their control, and with the surrounding sea Carry out the exchange of necessary things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep diving for a hundred meters, Lu Xien suddenly stopped, through the soul line: "I want to measure all the environmental parameters here, you look around "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded slightly, and a silver-gray-free sword was raised, and all the fluctuations and sloshing in the vicinity stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this depth, there are no strange sea creatures that can shine on their own, surrounded by darkness, no more light and no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, any mentally normal intellectual life will produce inexplicable fear, as if it is a dark sea of ​​great pressure, there is a hidden Indifference looks at your own sea monsters, they are waiting for opportunities, and they may swim at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not rushing to the 'Blue Gate,'?" Natasha saw this time when Lucien was going to experiment, and she was very puzzled. Whether it is really related to the eccentricity of the endless ocean, at least it is the most important clue so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien throws an "experiment "The hut" makes it a complete laboratory. Then a layer of faint silver light wraps it so that it is not eroded by sea water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me, collecting these environmental parameters and exploring the 'Blue Gate' is equally important and may even be more important. In the Arcane study, a lot of contrast The data is the key to unlocking the mystery.” Lucien replied casually, his eyes shifting to the “experimental hut” and his expression quickly became focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn’t ask more. After all, this is not the area she is good at. At this time, I believe that authority and “expert professor” are the only choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds the "Sword of Truth" and swims around in the mermaid. Prevents sudden attacks by deep-sea monsters. Although she is an epic knight, she has strong will and intuition. But in this deep sea where the water pressure is horrible and the light disappears, all kinds of feelings about the environment will be reduced a lot. If there is a slight intention, there will be omissions - even if Lucien gives her a blessing of "external protection bubble" and other spells. It is only equivalent to land within a certain range and cannot extend farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet deep sea, Lucien is concentrating on experiments, and occasionally a sea monster who perceives a stranger’s invasion is swaying with tentacles or pliers. All of them can be sneaked away under Natasha's "watching", and the guys who have been stunned by the desire to kill have turned into countless tiny pieces of meat after a silvery gray light, cheaper nearby. Other weak small fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Lucien followed the weird ocean currents that went deep into the sea, and stopped to experiment and collect data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咕噜·咕噜, Natasha, who was standing next to Lucien, suddenly noticed a little movement, and there seemed to be a lot of creatures coming along another stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a fish head covered in silver-gray scales carries a dark blue, pointed-eared elf in the current, with their Strength, could not bear this deep sea pressure, but the priests with the staff in the team, they joined forces to create a huge bubble. Transfer the pressure to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a land of miracles widely spread among the sea people, the "Azure Gate" is a generation that has been long-awaited by generations of shoal fish, gypsy fish, sea elves, deep sea Yalong, and mutated hippocampus. Dream homes, so when I heard that I could go to the "blue door" that I had never confirmed, these sea people would be so excited that they could not restrain themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest next to it is equally difficult to hide: "According to the description of His Royal Highness Doris, I will probably go for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questioning fisherman squatted with a pair of glowing dead fish eyes, and slammed the trident with his own sea elf captive: "Quick!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea elf is as angry as if to spurt the eyes of the squid, and seems to want to fight with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you look at? You are a prisoner now, be careful I will eat you now!" The recipe for the fisherman contains the sea without a doubt. Elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This female sea elf sounds crisp but sorrowful: "Her Majesty will come to save us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, if your Majesty the Queen can save you, then I will save it. Although she blocked her armpit by a dirty conspiracy, she has no spare power to save you!" The battle of almost victory is annoyed, how can the Empress Queen become so powerful? The son-in-law of the main sea eagle dimmed, and comforted himself: "The Queen is trying to use you to find the 'blue door, so it will not be saved for a while, maybe she will be behind you now!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she heard these damn fish people discussing "Azure Gate" every day, and her heart is also very curious. If she is not a prisoner, she will be very Exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, do you believe what you said? How could she know that we are coming to the 'blue door,'!" The little hope of the sea elves reminded her of her possible tragic experience. Will it be used by the big bad guy of Helks as the material to open the "blue door"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just in her desperation, there was a silvery glow in the dark water in front of it. It was pure and pure, just like the dark sea at a few kilometers deep. "Paradise Mountain" has come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is...····················································································· houses? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;诶, metal house? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the ocean, there are actually metal houses? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong hope in her heart, will it be the enemy of Helks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, her small eyes suddenly reflected a small silver gray sword light. It quickly grew from small to large, occupying the entire field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female sea elf feels that there are countless slashes of all the light that fills the surroundings, and there is only a cold, cold and radiant light in the visible line. Broken. A squid, a mutated sea, and various seas are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sword light disappeared, the female sea elf found that except for the captives and a priest, the other seas all became small flesh and blood. The illusory Jianguang is still swimming above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" A pleasing female voice with a little care and majesty sounded in the ears of these sea elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female elf recovered from the inexplicable shock and saw a heroic purple-haired female knight floating in front of her, with a smile and a mild look. Why, her heart suddenly warmed up, the grievances and infinite despair that came through this time came up. He choked: "Are you coming to save us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She felt that the female knight had not touched her head with the left hand of the sword, so the tears flowed more comfortably. If she had scruples, she would like to pounce on the other side and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Natasha of the Holm Kingdom, an ally of the Elf King, just meet you." Natasha simply showed her identity, “Can you tell me about your experiences?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
