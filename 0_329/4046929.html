			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler School of Magic consists of a tower of magical towers that travel through the strange forests, artificial light shining from the sky, creating light and shadow Interlaced beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Robert is a student of Mr. Felipe and has a very good standard in genetic factors, cell memory, and application of Necromancer, and is said to be his I exchanged the blood research materials left by the 'Abyss Lord' Netravos, and carried out a deep transformation of my blood and body. For example, his left eye has transplanted the main eye of the eye, and can quickly display some rays. Magic, the combat power is not worse than the high-level magician who just entered the sixth ring, the right hand hides the tentacles of the demon, can interfere with spiritual spells, absorb the brain and memory of each other..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are interested in these areas, you can consider choosing Mr. Robert's course. He is definitely the best one among the middle-level mentors. No more than that in the knowledge level and practical research. The high-level mentor is poor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl is flying and eager to introduce the mentor, the whole person is like a blooming tulip, attracting students ,teachers Fun eyebrows, but his voice was immediately given to the shock, leaving a trail of the statue of a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, it is no problem to say Mr. Robert’s special physical ability? Downey’s mouth twitched, and his mind subconsciously emerged as he imagined Mr. Robert’s appearance. On the faceless face of the dead man, a yellow-brown giant eye protruded from the left eye, and a clear blood vessel made it The eyelids are connected around, the right palm is spread out, and a strip of pale red tentacles is drilled, and the teeth are stretched toward the surrounding...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standard monster look...dead The Master of the Spirit is terrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But think about it, it's very powerful, very, cool?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thoughts in Donnie’s heart burst and shattered. Suddenly, he felt the sleeves of his right hand tight. After a moment of recovery, I took a closer look and it turned out that Sami was pulling her sleeves gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donny, is the special physical ability that Mr. Robert has transformed is not a secret? How does Carl say that everyone knows the same?" Sami is so confused and sleepy. The teenager also noticed that something was wrong, and he lowered his voice and asked Donnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny sees Carl still telling excitedly. Did not notice the alienation of their own. So he also said very quietly: "Karl is a descendant of the big man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his speculation, after all, if Carl himself is a big man, and what he has done event. I should have seen it from TV news, radio news or newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami long "oh", then no longer ask, not at all curious, Carl is the descendant of the big man, because he is now Drowsiness and eyelid fights, I really don't have the mood to pay attention to other people. Anyway, I know that I can't afford the big guys I can't afford, and Carl introduces the mentor of the body structure and genetic factors, not the soul and ghost field that I want to hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind him. Suddenly frightened twice, he also leaned against him, a pair of equally eager to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Carl’s voice and looking at Sami’s face, Downey’s heart secretly said: “One is a man who can be compared with an elf princess, a man. It’s a young boy who loves to sleep better than everything. My roommate is so weird...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf princess Elstin once came to the “heart of nature” The school has spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, only you are a normal person, an ordinary person." The awkward voice came into Donnie's ear and let him subconsciously nod, yeah. This room is only normal for me. Wait a minute, who is talking to me, how do you know my inner thoughts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned his head and found that the fat man was looking at himself with a smile, suddenly shocked and stunned: "You, when did you come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you invite me to take classes?" Jones was not angry at all, and answered very peacefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Downey learned that Sami scratched his hair, but I completely forgot about it and forgot your existence! Sure enough, it’s one...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downey's expression is completely stiff: "Do you know what I am thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the bridge we are passing now is called 'Cool Road', as long as you When the mood is fierce to a certain extent, the thoughts in the heart will reverberate in the corridor. The instructors remind the students that the study of the Necromancer must maintain the strictest calm, otherwise it will not only harm others, but even destroy themselves, even the soul. Can't save it, didn't you hear your inner voice?" Jones pointed to the bridge with no extra color in black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a road ahead of it, leading to the teaching tower and the experimental tower, with no windows on either side, only a faint glow from the wall tiles and floor tiles, giving people a deserted, The sense of silence seems to calm everyone's emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie listened, and the air faintly echoed the ethereal voice of "again...", and he looked at Karl and Sami with shame. They found that they were eloquent, and a head like a chicken and glutinous rice did not pay attention to anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, okay, they didn't hear..." Downey sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you worry about me?" The ordinary but strange voice sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny was shocked, turned his head again, and crossed with Jones, and found himself forgetting him again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, sorry." As a normal boy with honesty and good bottom line, Downey quickly apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones waved his hand and smiled and said: "Nothing, I like this special thing very much. At least when I am in danger, even the enemy will forget me, I I used to travel to the southern desert with my friends and met a person. After a fierce battle, both sides retreated and forgot me in the middle of the battlefield..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But in this way, no girl should remember you? If you have a wife in the future, will she forget that she has such a husband?" Downey asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones’s expression became stiff and smiled bitterly: “Don’t mention such a sad topic...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So, I chose the Necromancer system, I hope that through the blood research, physical transformation, we must turn this special talent into the ability that we can master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish you success." Downey said sincerely, "Yes, what is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jones, I have introduced myself It’s been a few times...” Jones’s voice was like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? But how can I only remember it once, that is in the bedroom, but I just remember that you introduced it, but don’t remember the specific content. ......" Downey became more and more aware that the whole bedroom is a weirdo besides himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One line of three people, no, four people, entered the teaching tower along the "Cool Road" flyover and found a place to choose a course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the distance is too close, I only introduced the mentor of the younger half. Even the courses have not been said yet. This can't blame me, mainly some tutors." The information is so rich..." Carl sighed, very regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason is that you are too divergent. The wife of the boss’s neighbor, who was just called Mr. Robert’s brother, spoke once... Donny silently whispered, then His eyes lit up and found a strange row of desk-sized devices in the room, which were wrapped in silver or dark black metal casings, each with two faint red and green lights flashing above, and a metal plate similar to a live screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?" Downey looked to Carl, he must know and happy to answer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin Wen’s quiet face once again showed an exciting color, making him look like a sun: “This is artificial intelligence, but a little bit of fusion. The artificial intelligence of Soul Fragment is more interesting than the one that is trying to be popularized..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artificial Intelligence?" Sami's body trembled, his eyelids slammed open The sleepiness disappeared for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is also a little excited, this is the legendary artificial intelligence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
