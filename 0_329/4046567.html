			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endless Wang Yang, Solar Islands, Magic Council Division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the shadow of the mid-level magician’s head in public has not been completely erased from Black’s mind, nothing prevents him from listening to the Voice of Mystery. And the "real world" move, which is popular in the entire archipelago, better than the banquet and dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening everyone, here is the "Aline Weekly News Review", I am your old friend Lark."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every night listening to this crisp and calm voice, Black is like a friend who really can listen to her friends in the mood of the night, never meet but feel familiar friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lark" reviews major news in a row, and Black listens intently, sometimes delights in the progress of arcane research, and sometimes as a dark Hall. The situation is worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the past few days, Allinge has had an unprecedented enthusiasm. I don’t know how many apprentices and magicians have sent resumes to the Institute of Atomic Research. The 18th floor of the Liner Magic Tower participated in the written test and interview. According to the insider's description, in the past few days, the Atomic Research Institute was a crowded, like a wave of oceans, such a grand occasion, she only participated in some of the Arcanists. I saw it during the second arcane meeting, they completely blocked the nearby passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lark" has a smile in the cold voice, especially When it comes to "informed people". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What resume? Written test, and interview?" Black whispered a little, but the words "Atomic Research" caused him to be strong. Interest, that should be Lucien? Mr. Evans' Atomic Research Institute? Did he propose a theoretical system that changed the times? No, there are apprentices and magicians involved, it should be something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lark" continues: "A lot of listeners who are not in Aringe should not know what happened, so I will briefly review this matter. On the day of July 3rd, the Institute of Atomic Research released the 'Apprenticeship Recruitment', preparing to hire ten apprentice-level assistants to assist the Arcanists in the Institute to conduct experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What's strange is that the Atomic Research Institute's recruitment method is very special. You need to get a resume form, fill in your name, age, faction, magic school assessment results and attach your own magic image. After screening, they selected some excellent candidates to participate in the interview..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black has nowhere to hear what the "Lark" is going to say, The brain creaked, and the words "Atom Research Institute" and "Preparing to hire ten apprentice-level assistants" seemed to turn into stormy waves, constantly hitting his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Atomic Research Institute actually lacks apprentice-level assistants?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can enter atomic research In the most cutting-edge research in the micro-domain, it may not be long before I can upgrade both the Arcane and the Magic level to the middle level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it's over. Their interviews should all be over..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Black’s opinion, if the Atomic Research Institute wants an apprentice assistant, the door can be immediately discharged around Alin. The team of the laps, of course, the reality is also true, but according to his ideas, shouldn't the elite apprentices should be recommended directly by the magic school, or the younger generation of the familiar high-ranking mage should be taken care of? They even released the task publicly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumored that Mr. Lucian Evans is a gentleman with a strict integrity and a strict arcane attitude. This should be his idea, fair, open and fair. Choose the best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of magic apprentices who don’t figure out in school, because of all kinds of encounters, the arcane and magical ability will be stronger than those elite apprentices. But because of the difference at the beginning, it is difficult to catch up on the level and not get more opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the disadvantage of staying away from Allinge. Many things are known after the expiration date. It is really frustrating..." Black sighed. Breathing, then concentrating, listening to the sound of the "Lark" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... It is understood that the number of apprentices who delivered resumes on the day exceeded 500, and nearly 80 formal magicians and mid-level magicians were willing to Apprenticeship is added to the Atomic Research Institute..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Mr. Evans will hold a discussion meeting every month. Even if you listen, the harvest should be great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... At present, the first round of resume screening, written test and interview of the Institute of Atomic Research has ended, Mr. Lucien Evans did not participate, the whole process is Mr. Rom and Mr. Rock are responsible. According to them, 25 qualified candidates have been selected. After the second round of recruitment, the final general interview will be held together, and Mr. Evans will be personally responsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, second round? Black almost jumped up, so there is still a chance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the "Lark" Qingyue passed into his ear: "Here, I want to remind the various divisions and local magic organizations outside Allinge. Members are today, July 8th, at 6pm on July 10th, resume delivery will be closed, and the second round of written test will begin on July 12th. If you are interested, please take the time to come to Aringe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all members of the Magic Council, and the Parliament and the Atomic Institute will treat you equally. This second round of solicitation is actually a special addition by Mr. Evans. Prepared for you, he said that he can't let the magicians and apprentices outside Aringe feel that they have been abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are slightly sour, Black is quite moved, The magicians and apprentices in Aringe will never feel the pain that seems to have been forgotten by the parliament, why the "voice of mystery" and "world truth" can become a popular way of entertainment throughout the island, except from inside. Learn a lot of knowledge and grasp the latest research trends, but also They provided a link to Allinge and the Islands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to Mr. Evans, thank you to the Parliament..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...You can ask my friends in Aringe to fill in and submit your resume. I think every branch and local organization should have electromagnetic communication. If there are no friends in Aringe, you can Contact the parliamentary task area directly, this is their contact method... everyone waits for the written test invitation before starting, don't let the branches and organizations work..." The sound of the "Lark" is in Black's ear at this time. Listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly resisting listening to the "World Reality" channel, Black anxiously waited for the dawn, waiting for Aringe time to arrive at 9 am. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sun was shining, Black rushed to the division's magic tower to prepare for the use of electromagnetic communication devices, and unexpectedly saw the long team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really hot..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene left Black with a The impression of extinction, and he waited until the afternoon to get the right to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black originally wanted to contact the responsible person in the mission area directly, but suddenly there was a ghostly figure in the heart, so the ghost changed the contact person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, which one?" came a very common female voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black took a deep breath: "It's me, Black. Ophelia, are you alright?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alright, something?" asked Ophelia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black discretion: "Are you still in Pefus County? Is it only two or three hours to Aringe?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you take the magic steam train, it only takes two hours and forty minutes, Black, would you like me to fill in and submit your resume for you?" Ophelia brought it in the voice. A smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black was surprised and said: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am heading to Aringe The magic steam train is also for the atomic research institute." Ophelia laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black scratched his head: "Please help me together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." After Ophelia replied, the two fell into a short silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Black couldn’t help but ask: "Are you not worried about that kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
