			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently took a breath, like opening a new page of destiny to open the hard-shell book and found the first The first page of the chapter "pronunciation" was very happy but not surprisingly found that the letters were used on one of the magic notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Lucien, who can use lingua franca smoothly, as long as you master the pronunciation of thirty-two letters and the initial spelling rules, you can try Read the words, compare them with the words and syllables that you usually use, and understand the meaning. You can also convert the usual syllables into spelling words and letters, so that you can learn the lingua franca very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor did not notice Lucy’s little joy, and said the pronunciation of the thirty-two letters very seriously and seriously. Lucien did some strange marks on the paper and went back and forth twice, only to go to the ordinary teenager next to him: "You read it carefully for dozens of times, if you come over, if you can carry it The book is read completely, then I will begin to teach you the initial spelling rules and grammar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just encouraged Lucien, as a beginner, It is impossible to recite the pronunciation of thirty-two letters so quickly, unless they are those who have strong memory, and such people, as long as they are willing to work hard, can have more achievements in his career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien carefully read the pronunciation of thirty-two letters, and then compared it with the Chinese on paper and the pronunciation of the pattern. After nothing wrong, calm down and concentrate, and open the library within the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the library, there is a bookcase called "Universal Language" with a piece of paper with a strange mark and a black hard-shell book. It is the same in front of yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the black hard-shell book, Lucien unexpectedly saw that there was only the first page above, and the back was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien saw the "Common Pronunciation and Primary Grammar" on the small round table from beginning to end at a very fast speed, and satisfactorily saw In the Soul Library, the black hard-shell book became complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s exactly the same as I guessed." Lucien smiled and said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the Soul Library, Lucien was full of confidence in learning the lingua franca in a short time, so he began to try to pick up thirty-two. The letters are pronounced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time many mistakes, the second time is still a lot of mistakes, the third time the error began to decrease, but the front can recite, and forgot some... Five times, Lucien forced the pronunciation of the letters to be completely remembered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien understands that this is just a momentary memory. If it is not consolidated for a while, it will soon be forgotten, and in the process, Lucy En has found that the spirit of using his own magical skills is very helpful for memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was swallowed up twice, Victor taught a round and walked to Lucien again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a touch of tiredness on his face, but compared with Lucien’s arrival, there was no such thing as a back-and-forth, restless state. It seems that shifting attention is a great help for his relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you give it to me again." Victor smiled affectionately to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not hesitate, directly opened his back, halfway back, suddenly forgot the pronunciation of a letter, vague, directly from the soul library The pronunciation mark was found on the paper inside, and then it was successfully finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Lun’s wants to cheat, but that his money is limited. It’s a bit of a time to learn more. Even if you don’t have it, there’s a library, completely It can be digested afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor has been prepared to correct Lucien’s pronunciation errors and unclear places, and when he finishes, he has not reacted. After a while, he wonders. Asked: "Have you learned pronunciation before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question, the voice is slightly louder, so that other people who are eager to learn are curious to look up and see To Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor did not doubt that he was slightly praised and said: "Your memory is very good, very rare. Well, then I will teach you the spelling rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others followed Lu Xi'an with amazement. I didn't expect his memory to be so outstanding. Of course, there were also ridicule and contempt. I felt that Lucien must have learned the pronunciation before, or how could it be completely short-term. Remember, this is just a pretense to deceive Mr. Victor's favor, and may later be accepted as a real student who can learn music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this little thing didn’t provoke much of the waves, especially three of the aristocratic students who were already learning music with Victor, and they quickly regained their heads. Continue to watch the music and music theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly an hour, Lucien learned the spelling rules without distracting thoughts. At this time, Lucien was thoroughly and clearly recognized in this environment. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you spend more than one day, you will spend a lot more money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, gentlemen, ladies, relax, eat some fruit, have a cup of tea, wait until you continue." Victor's spirit seems to be good When the servants served tea and a few cuts of cut fruit, they went to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tea is placed in a pale white, simple-patterned, glazed porcelain cup with handles, with jasmine, orange slices, etc., showing the orange color. The fruit has a familiar familiarity with the road, and there are also weird species that have never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing ordinary aristocratic costumes, a young man with a sea-like dark blue hair smiled and said to his companions: "Mr. Victor seems to have some inspiration, if it is the source of inspiration. If you keep on, today's study is probably over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks older than Lucien, with narrow eyes and tall nose, holding in his hand It is a thin sheet of music. In a few aristocratic students, there is a feeling of being surrounded. Only a noble girl in a burgundy dress sits demurely but replies in a lazy tone: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lott, if Mr. Victor ends early, it will definitely be added on the weekend, and if he can make new music, we will be able to I did the practice with the orchestra. I don't want to do monotonous music study and ordinary flute playing training. Only by practicing with the regular symphony orchestra can I make progress faster."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is about seventeen or eight years old. With a bright appearance, a long flame-like hair, and a thick and surnamed lips, the waist is not as thin as her cousins, as it would cause difficulty breathing, and breathing difficulties are blowing. Bad flute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot looked at the red-haired girl and couldn’t help but smiled: "The orchestra that cooperated with Mr. Victor, just came a few days ago. Like the chief of Yinyue, Felice, the two of us were with Mr. Victor at the time. You want to practice with the orchestra, do you like him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of the symphony orchestra is the first violinist. When there is no command, he will also play the role of conductor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t insult me ​​with the spirit of your playboy, I just think that his violin is very good, much better than the original chief gentleman.” Felice Retorted, but there was a strange blush on his face. "Don't you think that he played very well when playing 'the first violin sonata in g minor"? Do you think that your violin performance is higher than him? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When referring to music, Lott immediately became serious and excited, and began to discuss various musical knowledge and music with Felice, several other aristocratic students. I inserted a sentence or two from time to time. Obviously, I was very interested in this topic. Even the brown-haired girl among the civilian students who had been treated coldly couldn’t help but interrupted and published a veritable discourse. They also got their nod. Agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aalto, music is another lingua franca. Of course, aristocratic students still consciously or unconsciously ignore civilian students and Lucian, while civilian students also intentionally or unconsciously turn a blind eye to Lucien and try to get close to the nobility. students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No cold words, no irony, only deep estrangement and indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
