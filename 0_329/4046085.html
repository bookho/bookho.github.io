			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Oh, as usual, this chapter is updated in advance on Monday morning for referrals and clicks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, thank you for your support. Last week was the first week of the week, and the fourth week of the week, very good results~<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still on the shelves for two days, and I’m asking for continued support this week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only keeping the last swaying Lutheran, is ready to accept the death force and transform it with his body, because it is better than entanglement It is good to stimulate the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, follow-up plans should also make corresponding changes, from direct to indirect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the darkness outside the Lucian hut took a foot in the dark black shoes without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this foot stepping out, the silver moon in the night sky seems to suddenly illuminate a little, so that the moonlight that just happens to shine into the crack of the Lucien Lodge becomes Condensed, more chaste, more clear, as if laying a thin layer of silver cream on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Semi-conscious Lu Sian, suddenly felt around the meditation starry sky, a illusion of a beautiful silver moon, the bright and dreamy moonlight shines directly on The body is getting brighter and brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the moonlight, Lucien’s inherently weak blood force is vigorously and rapidly growing, and in just a few seconds, the power of death The key moment to suppress the power of the stars, defeat both at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it quickly took the upper hand and completely suppressed all other blood forces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change is so sudden and incredible, Lucien has not had time to produce any ideas, this blood force that has some connection with Silver Moon has been completed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the radiant and bright silver moon has become soothing, and with the strong and powerful beating of Lucien’s heart, it rushes to every corner of the body. The body, internal organs and nerves were transformed, and the pain began to turn into itching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this change happening? Can the environment also affect the blood of the stimulus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The itchiness of the whole body is much better than the severe pain just now. Lucien gradually woke up from a semi-conscious state and recalled the strange things just now. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has not read the documents and books that record the process of stimulating the blood power, Lucien can't think of a reason, can only accept it temporarily, and start to adapt the blood to transform the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Lucien Lodge, another foot in dark black leather shoes appeared from the darkness, took a step forward, and then both feet entered at the same time. In the darkness, disappeared without a trace. The bright, bright silver moon shines into the gap and is quickly dimmed, no different from other moonlights around the hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood transformation was gradually completed, and Lucian stood up from the ground. Look at the hands that don't seem to change much,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But without experimenting, Lucien can feel the power of his hands and can easily crush a person The throat is fierce than any strong man who has not stimulated the blood power, and compared to the growth of strength, when the blood force has been transformed into the body, Lucien has already had an intuitive sense. Speed, agility, and coordination of the surname are the blood power. The advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the foot, Lucien ran in the lab, almost to drag the residual image, in a small laboratory, high-speed road Sean did not touch anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapted for a while, Lucien’s speed even improved, but the shoes seemed to be a little bit unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My speed and agility, even if it is not much worse than the second-level knight of the 'shadow' blood, this is still the blood that I rely on the medicine to stimulate Perfect, not the reason of the real knight. If it is the knight who really inspired this blood force, it is only a level, speed and agility will be comparable to the second-level knight whose advantage is not above this. It is a good blood force. "Lu Sien stopped and assessed his strength. "But the strength and physical condition are much worse than the ordinary first-class knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"There is dark vision, and you can see about two hundred meters in the night." There was a silvery light in Lucien's black pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body can be moonlighted to reduce the damage." Lucian hands began to blur into the silver moonlight, but with the current blood of Lucien, it is not completely The actinization, which is possible for the 7th-level Knights, can't withstand the same damage as the Dragonscale armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the primary moonlighting, Lucien can avoid injury to ordinary weapons, and can reduce a certain degree of damage to magic weapons, magic weapons, force field shock waves, etc. It can also weaken the elemental damage of fire and acid, as well as the invasion of death forces. "In general, although the current moonlight is not comparable to the dragon scale defense of the watchman 'Red Dragon' blood, it is also a kind of Good ability, and sneak in the night to beat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Lucien took a sterling silver dagger and opened a hole in his hand. While watching it flow out a small amount of blood, it quickly squirmed and recovered, while recording: "There is a certain ability to heal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately not similar Shadow fire, Longwei, red dragon breath and other supernatural attack ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is a little regrettable, although this blood force is powerful, but also has Its huge flaw, "according to the type of blood power, it should be 'month 'Blood veins, not belonging to the dark surname.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien is currently in contact with the data, there is no knowledge of blood circulation and exercise to improve blood circulation, but The church has compiled the common blood power surnames into books, so that the knights who are able to motivate the blood can master their abilities more quickly and use them to identify dark knights and arrest them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of book is in the music library, and John often mentions to Lucien and tells about the metal and earth blood he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is the 'moonlight' blood, when the light of the silver moon is bathed, the strength, physical fitness, speed and agility will be improved, according to the blood. The introduction, its strength and physique will reach the higher level of the first-class knight, agility and speed even have bloody advantages in the lower level of the second-level knights in these two aspects, the moonlightization weakens the damage more, the self-healing ability is more Strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am more than a knight who officially inspired this blood power, but in the silver moon shine, strength and physical fitness should also be able to compete with ordinary The Cavaliers, agility and speed are the highest level of the first-class knight, and the moonlight, self-healing ability, and dark vision will also increase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, the most intense sun, the 'moonlight' blood will be suppressed, but there is no 'dark' blood, 'silver moon' blood, 'vampire' blood, etc. After all, 'moonlight' blood is not comparable to these blood types at night, Greatly improved in the moonlight."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reveals the rare smiles he has seen these days, sorts out his clothes, and is very satisfied with the "moonlight" blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of supernatural power attacks is a weakness for others, but for yourself, it does not need to care too much, and when it is suppressed at noon, the strength is also Those who are stronger than any non-Knight ranks will not have a strong night and extremely weak daytime, and are one of the most suitable blood power for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After initial assessment and adaptation to their own "moonlight" blood, road Sean collected the experimental materials and applied them to the "Save Organs" magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After performing this apprenticeship, Lucien’s expression is slightly weird: “The mental power has been greatly improved, and I am only one step away from the high-level magic apprentice. Is it caused by the blood force to transform the flesh and feedback the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Lucien can perform 19 apprenticeships in a row to exhaust the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of promotion is obvious in the apprenticeship stage, but it is actually not much. It’s just the harvest of Lucien’s meditation for about four months, the official magician stage. Unremarkable growth, so the magicians who used this pharmacy to give their support to the growth force did not record its benefits for spiritual improvement, and the witch family has been a lot of people who have not gotten the materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
