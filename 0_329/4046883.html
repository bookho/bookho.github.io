			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the Allinge Magic Tower, Douglas’s position has become a whirlpool that constantly rotates and swallows everything around it, because even the light is covered by it I swallowed it in, so it was dark and dark, with the horror that seemed to destroy the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook and Hathaway, while controlling the lock of Allinge, are ready to resist the attack of the gods, while watching this change carefully, drawing lessons from it. Explore the principles of the entire process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They saw the pre-prepared materials in the magic array fly wildly, almost swallowed up by the vortex, and saw the surrounding highlights in the main material world. The half-plane "real secret" and Douglas's "cognitive world" are fragmented under the huge suction, and they are thrown into the whirlpool. The lines and patterns of the magic array are peeled off from the ground under the action of suction, and they are gathered one inch at a inch. Gathering, condensing into a ball, incorporating the darkness of the group...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unexpected changes in the scene make Brooke inevitably nervous, especially when the suction reaches its maximum, even When Alinhe's lock, Hathaway, and himself seemed to be swallowed up, they almost made a legendary spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hathaway blocked him in front of him and shook his head gently, indicating that he would wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destiny Starry Sky" shrinks inward, and the "Stars" in the sky are pouring into the dangerous and dark vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex slammed down, motionless, and the surrounding time and space seemed to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook and Hathaway can feel the majestic energy brewed in the whirlpool and the strange feelings in the gestation, but all are blocked by the vortex I don't know if I can break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is getting more and more depressed, the ticking of all the wall clocks in Allinge City has become slow, and the Arctic and other arcanes who have noticed the vision are nervous and Looking forward to the dark sky without a glimmer of light, as if watching the deepest and deepest night sky before dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the center of the vortex swelled and contracted more and more intensely. Then, it started the crazy rotation again, but the direction was just completely in contrast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the whirlpool violently squirted out another hot glow, and then a red-hot "sun" spurted out of it, and it rose. The day is empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the "sun" sprinkled on all directions, dispelling the deep darkness before, and the light returned to the world again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single star spurts out from the "whirlpool" and flies into the sky, occupying its position, even if it faces the sun, it is not inferior, again The scene of "Destiny Starry Sky"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos tears the atmosphere and flies to the holy city of Reims, no matter what Alinge is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the darkness in front of his eyes became bright, the surrounding clouds were golden, and the back felt as if it could melt the horrible heat of armor and his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good! Melmos screamed and tried his best to speed up and try to get rid of the scope of influence. At this time, the illusion of high temperature that melted everything suddenly disappeared, and his back was cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos is not fortunate because he has a much stronger premonition than just now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to use the power of the "Sacred Avengers" to burn his own blood, and did not care about such a huge hidden danger, it is difficult to recover, Maybe you will let yourself return to the embrace of the Lord a hundred years earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos is entwined with one after another, and the whole person is like a "sun god" coming, and the light is so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Brooke and Hathaway saw a spurt of darkness that also devours all feelings. It did not affect the surroundings and jumped directly into it. "Starry sky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Hole Phantom? The two have a clear understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! His armor broke into countless pieces and turned into a metal storm to the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he benefited from the previous decision, and finally broke away from the dangerous to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Melmos found that he only escaped one meter more than when attacking Aringe’s lock, and the “mass” who were secretly “onlookers” It seems very strange to be a wolverine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful observation, Melmos turned into a sun and turned to the direction of the holy city of Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the dark mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Wicken saw a star rising into the sky after the sun rose, and the platinum scepter lifted in his hand quietly put down, everything was too late ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face sinks like water, but there is no violent thunder, but calm down and observe this process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a star, the "dark vortex" flew into the starry sky, and the different constellations of the constellation flew into the starry sky, and the galaxy flying like a gem string flew into the sky. The starry sky, the river-like river system also flew into the sky...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a scene that simulates the real universe..." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves, Dracula, Danisos, etc. People in places like Rentat, Cox, and Antilles are all fascinated by the real starry sky that "falls on the ground". They feel that everything is like a dream, and the beauty is shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the entire diffuse sky huddled and huddled toward the top of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook and Hathaway saw the center of the magical array that had disappeared, "Starry Sky" gathered, collapsed into Douglas, but compared to the previous "Arcane The emperor, now he has a blunt but sorrowful and sultry atmosphere, as if it is the "great starry sky" surrounded by the planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it should be He! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations to the Speaker of the House of Representatives." Hathaway’s face of a rare smile on the face of a smile showed a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Brooke’s mood is complex, his eyes are slightly moist and authentic: “Congratulations to the teacher as a god.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His half-white old-school gentleman is also a rare and true feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas wanted to say something, but in the end he smiled and shook his head and patted Brooke’s shoulder. They both said to them: “One day, you also You can explore this level, because this is the path of our magician's god-like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what kind of soul and physical changes have you become a god?" Brooke originally intended to congratulate a few more words, but in the end it still became an arcane problem, this is the rhythm he used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas indulged: "The flesh is integrated into the soul, and the soul is transformed into another state, just like the unity of the two images, but if I want to In the real world, you can only choose to collapse in a certain direction. That is to say, what I see now is not a complete me, but one of my circumstances, and if I want to play all the power of the gods, It can only be maintained for a short period of time, otherwise it will either be unable to interfere in the world or be forced to collapse by the whole world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may be a natural class such as Silver Moon. The reason why God is truly restricted must be stabilized by the existence of the alienation space or other methods of its own existence... The Wichen-like method of the gods is based on the power of faith, so there is no such defect, but this also proves The state of their gods is extremely dangerous and there is no real 'classical property'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri, while thinking about Douglas’s description, asked : "What is the real state of the gods? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a 'state' that you can't see, can't hear, can't smell, can't touch, in that state, even if I stand In front of you, you have no knowledge, you can even pass through me, and the magic of exertion can't affect me, just as we are in two overlapping but non-interfering worlds. This may be 'silver moon'. 'The reason why it can't be discovered.' Douglas is happy to share his own situation. "So, this state is flawed and incomplete. Once you can solve these problems, you should be able to touch the mysteries of the true God."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
