			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa hall, Lawrence, wearing a silver robe, stood in the middle of the altar, and the face that was distorted by pain was filled with enthusiasm and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can clearly feel that with the fusion of the shadow behind him, his blood is boiling, he is cheering, and he is slowly transforming his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This is the prelude to stimulating blood power? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Would you like to start? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[My 40 years of chasing and hope will succeed? ! 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lawrence’s ear, the lingering and sultry surroundings are like the applause and cheers of the Cavaliers, but at this time, he found His body swayed back and forth, and there was a feeling of instability. There was a jingling sound around the villa, and a dusty ceiling fell on the ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Is it an earthquake? ! 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This time the earthquake! Is it the punishment of the Lord? ! Lawrence, who changed his faith in pursuit of power, because the time is too short, there is still a fear of the god of truth in the heart. At this most important moment, a sudden earthquake will inevitably remind him of the god of truth in the myths and legends. All kinds of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[No, it’s only the last step. After waiting for forty years, I’m going to motivate my blood. How can I give up now? As long as it can stimulate the blood and become a knight, even if the villa collapses, I have a chance to live! 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a small half of the illusion that seems to know the thoughts of Lawrence’s mind, with the voice that penetrates the soul: "The magical array and traps of the arrangement There is no earthquake, and you fully integrate my projection. It takes six or seven minutes. This shaking is getting more and more intense. If the whole house collapses, you can't survive. Lawrence, stop first, anyway, you have merged me. The projection power of the small half reaches the peak of the high-ranking knight attendant, and there is a chance to merge next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of hell is very fast, only a dozen In seconds, I passed my thoughts to Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence is very angry, is about to succeed and is blocked by natural disasters, let him want to vent and do not know who to vent, depressed and blasted: "No, it is very likely that the earthquake will soon stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still refused to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, the sound of slaps came, the window shattered in a strong sway, and the squally winds that were coming in front of the storm were coming in, The sweet, sinful (introduced) * chaotic taste swept away, so that in the shaking of the villa seems to be collapsed, still indulged in the surname of the love of men and women, wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord! Earthquake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help, ah!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are wearing clothes in a panic, some are naked [*** ] I hurried to the gate, and some people ran directly to the window... For those who did not have the power of the knight, or even a part of the slim lady, if they were buried in the earthquake, they would only be buried here. I can pray for the Lord's blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who emptied the essence and strength of the body by the evil ritual, stumbled, one of the women fell to the ground, tired and so afraid that the legs were soft The station couldn’t stand up and could only climb to the gate. The man who had just shared joy and happiness with her, when she ran past her, did not look at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrificed lambs left the place one by one, the lines on the altar were quickly extinguished, and the shadow disappeared, and Baron Lawrence screamed and vented his heart. Depressed and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion, he quickly woke up from the fanatical expectations and grievances, saw his villa still shaking violently, cursing: "Damn The earthquake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he rushed to the outside of the villa and removed the magic traps that blocked his road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow outside the villa, the eyes are round and the mouth is wide, the sages, white honey and Smyr, who can’t speak, Looking at the violent shaking of the villa, the horrible professor took back his hands and slowly returned to the shadows, saying in a still dark voice and a very dull tone: "They started to run outside, you are ready, killing That evil creature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, don’t you just let the villa get rid of it?” White honey looks like the villa that is still shaking sharply because of the habit of surname Not awake, subconsciously asked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien yin and laughed twice: "If the villa is smashed and the evil creatures are killed inside, how can I quickly collect the blood of evil creatures? The sound of the slamming is very big, and it will surely alarm the wandering night watchman, even the nearby church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two reasons are only partial, real The reason is that although the natural frequency of the house is not like the ultrasonic wave and the high-intensity infrasound wave, it is the current mental power of Lucien that can produce the same shock wave through the "professor's resonance hand", but the house is a complex structure. Its natural frequency is not one, but many, according to the vibration feedback and mental arithmetic adjustment, Lucian can only simulate the first natural frequency, let it shake, and can not let all of its resonance collapse, and Lucian is only the trainee magic Apprentice, this magical energy is not enough to make a strong house collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, relatively, to get a bridge, Lucien may still be able to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Lucien really make the Sage, Smyr and White Honey completely awake, just this time there is no casting material, and no mantra is heard. The magic should be the true strength of Professor, really terrifying and awesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look at Lucien's gaze, thoroughly filled with respect and fear of powerful, profound magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey restores calmness, enters the spell-casting focus, and passes through a magical item on the body, sensing the crowd running outside the villa, hoarse with a slight The voice of the surname is calm and cold, saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The object with evil creatures is 15 meters from the nearest window, we move one meter to the left, Release the magic well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sage moves while staying focused: "Smyr, 'Homerz's cough'."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Homerz's cough" is a high-pitched sound wave attacking magic. People who are directly hit will lose balance, get hurt, and even die, while the people around them It will be damaged by the eardrum, and the stun will pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sage, silence barrier, careful and odious black gloves." Smyr also calmly answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey continues to report the position of Baron Lawrence: "The strength of the high-ranking knight attendant, and five meters, the low devil projection fusion, do not use acid and fire magic There is still one meter, preparation, I will use 'shooting technique'." She judged the strength of Baron Lawrence from the speed of running, the agility of falling off the small stones, and the power of the person who broke the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cool communication, in just a few seconds, has already determined the location, strength, and own first-round attack of Baron Lawrence, let Lucien, standing quietly beside them, first experienced the fighting style of a magic apprentice with formal teaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to escape from the earthquake, Baron Lawrence slammed into the front of the guest, rushed to the window in a few seconds, then held his head and slammed into it. Open this unbroken glass and jump outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Lawrence just leaped, but suddenly there was a loud bang in the ear, like a storm that had been brewing for a long time and finally began a fierce thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang in his ear, his head was like a blast, and there was a feeling of tumbling inside the body. He could not maintain the balance, and fell down directly, barely Feet on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, an arrow with a metallic cold light hits the right eye of Baron Lawrence, who is still awake in dizziness, deeply tied. Going in, the dark red, sulphur-like blood flowed down and was caught by an invisible hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
