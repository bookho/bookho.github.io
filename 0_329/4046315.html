			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Aalto is still immersed in the sorrow of the daytime funeral, the suburb of Melze Black Forest in the suburbs, covered by darkness and clouds, Lucy En is saying goodbye to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Joel, they have trouble with Natasha. I have a hunch, after this dark mountain send a letter, my life in a short time. There will be a great change that may prompt me to go further into the study of arcane and magic, and this may increase the church’s attention to me and expose my fake death, so if John is not willing to go If you report me, please secretly send someone to supervise and guide, so that you can minimize your suspicion before the event is exposed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't let you Another reason why the sword kills the clown is here. If you are colluding with me and knowing it, you will definitely stop murder and kill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi The temperature and pleading of the grace of the language, do not rush to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, still wearing the plain black dress during the day, snorted: "It’s really stressful to be a friend with your magician, make a piece of it. There seems to be more than one purpose behind the matter. Hey, Lucien, don't you have anything else to deceive me or have another purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems like a lot. Lu Xien smiled slightly with a slight sigh: "Where is there, there is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s surname is hearty, just a few words. At this time, Lu Xien did not want to say, and did not care, solemnly nodded: "If John refuses to report you within half a year, I will secretly exert pressure, rest assured, will not hurt them."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promises to finish this matter, Natasha is a little excited and a little concerned about the earth: "Lu Xien, the dark mountains are very different and powerful creatures, just enough to know Hundreds of kinds, there are all kinds of dragons, fallen elves, trolls, deformed spiders, scarlet demon trees, lightning hawks, etc., you have to be careful "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And most of the ancient inheritors are cruel, indifferent, and ruthless. They are good at taboo experiments, indulging people's hearts, on life, on themselves, and on specific objects. There is no sense of identity outside of things. Apart from making yourself strong and satisfying your own desires, there is no other idea. When dealing with them, be vigilant and alert. They are not what you encountered in the Magic Council. Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you are sending a letter to a certain person, from the normal logic, the magic council or the element will definitely have arrangements, will not let you In a state of mortality, but we do things, it is best not to pin our hopes and hopes on others in the first place, and we can rely on ourselves only."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En Gang experienced a cruel farewell with the Joel family. The mood was a time when the agitation was not stable. Therefore, it was very useful to feel Natasha’s concern. He joked with a hint of joy: “Natasha, why are you? Describe dangerous organisms and When I passed on to the magician, I couldn’t feel your prudence, but I was a little bit excited about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course, you don’t feel like taking risks in such dark mountains. Very interesting, very excited? Fighting with all kinds of strange creatures and enjoying different extraordinary strengths, it is a great enjoyment.” Natasha was very excited and sighed with great regret: “Actually know that you are going After the dark mountains, I want to be with you. This will satisfy my long-cherished desire and protect you. But I am the Earl of Violet, the future grandfather. I have to consider my people, my knights, my nobles, and my father is left with my relatives. I have no qualification for adventure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although unfortunately, she did not complain a bit. The education she received from her childhood and her own surname made her understand it very well.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Natasha is as embarrassed as the usual, bluntly said that she intended to protect herself, Lucian is a little embarrassed: "It doesn't matter, Natasha, I believe in my As long as the strength is not in the depths of the dark mountains, most of the dark creatures I can cope with. When I come back, I will tell you about the adventures of personal experience. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you have a Holm crown ring." Natasha nodded more confidently, then smiled like a fox and took out a pair of violet-like petals: "This is the constant sent by my elders' Fernando's electromagnetic communication earrings, if you are in danger I can inform you that I know that you have similar items on your body. Hey, the thunderous electric field in the Stormwinds has blocked your connection with the Magic Council, but in Aalto, you have reinforcements. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are in danger, I will not refuse to ask you for help." Lucien nodded seriously. Suddenly, some regrets rose and blurted out: "Unfortunately, the lightning field and distant distance of the Stormy Strait make the electromagnetic communication unstable. It is easy to be destroyed, otherwise we can always contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s a pity." Thinking of this, Natasha is also a pity. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an idea in the heart of Lucien: "Is it necessary to speed up the study of arcane, and then send a few magic satellites to the sky as the intermediate station for communication?" Bypassing the Stormwind Strait, you can often talk to Natasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are known by other magicians, Magic Satellite and Telematics Magic It was born because a magician wants to contact a distant girl, will it be very shameful, and whether the world is a planet, whether or not the orbit is not yet determined, we must continue to study..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, what are you thinking?" Natasha saw Lu Xi'an silent, thinking that he was regretting the electromagnetic communication, comforting: "It doesn't matter, anyway, we can use me." I often write letters in the name. Sometimes, writing letters feels better than direct calls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was returned by Natasha to the endless association of Lucien. God came, and my heart wondered: "Wait, why should I think so much? Is it? ...no, no, she likes female surnames, we are good friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange feeling in the heart of Lucien quickly denying his inexplicable The idea, gently nodded: "It is good to be able to keep writing letters, but we need to re-contract the signs of different meanings so as not to be perceived by the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After the two agreed again, Natasha smiled and smiled brightly: "Lu Xien, I don't know how long it will take you to go back to the dark mountains to return. According to normal calculations, you may miss your oysters. Since we met, you I am not present in every oyster. It is a pity, so please allow me to invite you to dance an open dance. I wish you happiness in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is slightly stunned, her right hand is holding her chest, her left hand is extended, and the standard men’s etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is funny and kindly: "His Royal Highness, I should invite you by this man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't pause, Lucien Weng smiled and said: "Since knowing, Natasha, I have not been present for every oyster, so please allow me to invite you to dance this opening dance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucien is equally embarrassed, with his right hand on his chest and his left hand extended, the same posture as Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha smiled and raised her eyebrows, then stood up straight, her right hand extended, and placed on Lucien’s left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No music, no melody, only strong air in the air and clouds around, but Lucien and Natasha are good at music, full of dance moves Rhythmic beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been a few years of high-rise Lu Xien, although they still want some Natasha, but they are almost the same, so when dancing, the two look Relatively, the breath smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Natasha’s deep, silver-purple eyes, the beautiful appearance of the atmosphere, the warm and sweet smell of her, the soft and beautiful body, before Lucien, who had a strange idea, suddenly became uncomfortably uncomfortable. It was completely different from the peace of mind and laughter when dancing with Natasha. The heartbeat seemed to be somewhat uncontrollable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s eyes gazing and dodging himself, his face seems to be slightly red, his feet are slightly stiff, and his right hand and his hands are holding his shoulders. Some of them got bigger, and they were very abnormally silent and didn't talk. The breath that sprayed on their lips and nose looked heavy and hot. Natasha began to think that the atmosphere was too strange and inexplicable, making him feel uncomfortable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, what's wrong with you?" Natasha asked skeptically, no need to cover up between friends, "Is not worried about the dark mountains?" Things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head a little slyly: “No, just dancing in the air for the first time, a little uncomfortable.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, me too, the wind is very big, the surroundings are very empty, only the clouds." Natasha laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
