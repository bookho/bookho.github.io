			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving these four words, Lucien was not wasted, and the fire wolf was completely intact after being attacked by various supernatural forces such as magic and magic. Two items were taken down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a dark red bracelet, which is woven with thin red velvet, with a hint of flame, although it looks Like ordinary, low-quality jewellery, but Lucien can feel the violent burning and the illusion of horror power with a little bit of mental energy. These flames seem to be constructed into several complex spell models and ingeniously The way to combine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item is an iron-black dagger, sharp and cold. "This ring is stronger than my 'Ice and Snow Vendors', at least Two high-level magic items." Lucien received the dark red bracelet and two other items in the magic robe, turned and dragged the shadow, took a circle in the Black Forest, and ran across the Marsol River. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still many bodies within 500 meters of the guardian’s cabin, there may be some magical, magical and sorcerer items on the body, but Lucien I dare not delay. At this time, greed is to find death, and those magical and sorcerer items may have imprints that are easy to trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the Marshall River and entering the Black Forest on the other side, it ran for a long time. When it was completely hidden in the darkness, Lucien stopped and resumed. Not all the healing and physical exertion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien used his mental power to forcibly explore the "dark red bracelet", "link", "iron black dagger", with their extraordinary power Counterattack, the internal structural model is memorized in the soul library, ready to go back and slowly resolve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing this, Lucien used the position of the stars and the silver moon to determine his coordinates on the ground, and buried the "link" and "residue" in one. Some characteristics of the cedar tree nearby, and then walked out a long distance, found a boulder, hidden "dark red bracelet", "iron black dagger" under the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unresolved, confirming that these items are not tracked and positioned, Lucine can't bring them back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Lanaka Canyon" in a dark corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the bald head is a variety of strange magic lines, Angra, the high priest is being pinched by a hand, held in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the person in front of his eyes in astonishment and fear, and said, "Why are you killing me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a seven-level high priest, after Angra was pinched by this long, white sergeant, it seemed as if he had lost all his power and could not use the horror of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to escape from the encirclement of Camille, Amorton, and Cosette by the shadows, but it has consumed all the items." You, it is difficult to get rid of Amorton's tracking. Although she is a cardinal on the surface, she is actually the giant responsible for the Vaolirit referee, and is the top three experts in the Principality in tracking." A nice and soft voice Answering with a smile, "If you are caught by her, all your plots are exposed, so I will clean up you for Ilya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela did not expect this reason, ridiculous, can not believe the authentic: "You can save me! And you and our purpose should be consistent, but we will find the person with this opportunity." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft voice smiled a little disgustedly: "The most hated believers of these devils, the smell of sulfur in the blood is unbearable, so Still killing. Also, about this time, I changed the Lord. I don't want to participate, but it becomes very interesting and fun, I will watch it well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy?" Angela wants to growl But the voice only came out a little bit, "How can you temporarily change your mind, why are you doing this? Don't you be afraid that the big guys will punish you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Like." The soft voice of good ending ended the conversation with a short answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angea, whose slender fingers are pinched, began to dry up with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at you are dead, send you an intelligence for free, Hathaway is about to return from the space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound falls, the long white hands are integrated into the darkness in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After less than two minutes, a mature woman wearing a bright red bishop's suit stood out from the air, and her eyes looked cold and sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The traces of the high priest of the Silver White Point disappeared completely?" After a while, she whispered with a faint doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the dark forest of the hustle and bustle, Lucien followed the route to come to Felice’s estate and rushed back. Let all kinds of ferocious creatures dare not approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty minutes later, Lucien saw the manor of Felice, and the darkness surrounding it illuminated the main house hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dance is not over yet? It is almost twelve o'clock." Lucien stopped in the Black Forest outside, and then quietly tracked and monitored these days. Your own cultist touched the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy's manor is far from the underground ruins, and there are several undulating peaks and veins in the middle, so that people can't find the battle outside the remnants here. And the "Golden White Horn" retreats very quickly and is very hurried, so the cult is forgotten, no one has notified him, maybe he will re-contact him when the "Silver Point" is stabilized again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the cultist leaned behind the tree and quietly prayed for meditation without any abnormality, Lucien was relieved with a long breath: Camille and the church people should still chase and search for the main force of the 'Silver Corner', and can't care for the small fish here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For Lucien, the cult is the biggest flaw in his own nine-true falsehood. If he is caught, he can only hope that the interrogator will forget to tell him that he has "get it from his hand." Gifts, things that stimulate blood power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking out another common dagger, Lucien’s chance to shine in the moon, blurring into a silver shadow, and moving silently toward the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through today’s watch, Lusien has been able to affirm that he is not a formal cult "deity", but a breakthrough, more spiritual than ordinary high-order The apprentice's "pre-approval" is in line with the judgment of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cultist, Lucien slipped the flickering fluorescent powder in his hand, without a spell, the mental power changed the frequency of the wave in advance, and the "forbidden light" was displayed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no darkness in the darkness, and the cult is shrouded in it, although he feels when the magical fluctuations occur, but everything It’s already half a step late, and the eyes are only completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Dark Vision, Lucien was unaffected, clearly seeing the cultist who had a black flame on his body. Spread out to the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black flame did not burn any vegetation, but it caused the nearby ants and insects to fear and kept spinning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Ice and Snow Vengeance" Lucien judged that the magic flame is a sorcerer of fear, without any hesitation, directly hit the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear invades the soul, but the will is strong as a stone, without a slight shake, Lucien’s moonlit body drags into a shadow and rushes into the darkness, touched A warning trap pre-arranged by the cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultist inspires the "Fear Talisman" to block and slow the enemy's attack, and then casts other sorcer defenses or counterattacks, but the "Fear of the Flame" just spread out He felt the feedback of his warning trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore he could not see anything, silently recited in his mouth, and a wave of ripples attacked in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic sorcerer "Crush the Mantra"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne is early on for the warning trap, because if you are meditating or monitoring others outside, you will definitely have something similar around you. It was a good habit of every caster, so when he first touched the trap, Lucien immediately changed his mind and circulated a half circle to the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
