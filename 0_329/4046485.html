			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravel slaps like a rain, when the electric light disappears and the eyes recover, Harold only sees the vampires such as Nelson and the vampires behind him The traces of destruction, the entire hall swaying, it seems that it will not collapse long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A small silver coin can also cause such a big damage?" A member of the mechanical knight was shocked to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold suddenly woke up and shouted loudly: "That is because of the blessing of divine power! The great god of steam is not only the god of machinery, life and The ruler of death is the king of the Thunder, the Lord of punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is it silver coin?" Another member of the mechanical knight is also a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold is not a dwarf who is good at religious studies. He has racked his brains: "That means that the great god of steam is also the god of money. He is God." The god, the king of kings, naturally has to dominate multiple fields."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the greatness of everything to God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there are no doubts for the members of the Mechanical Knights, including Harold, all the members bowed their heads and prayed at the door of time and space: "Steam is supreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then several people entered the space-time door in pairs, and left the underground hall in half an hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just left, the force that suppressed the time and space of the door suddenly disappeared, the space swayed violently, and a little starlight fell off from above. Gradually, the entire door was completely broken, and the underground palace collapsed completely.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, Sanielson’s “father”, a vampire duke, was able to rely on the “blood pulse” to find out because he knew his disappearance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Space node, there is a space node! The vampire's face looked at the collapsed underground palace with a dignified look. He no longer cares about the situation of San Nielsen, but turned angrily. "No matter how Vlad is going to sleep, he has to give an explanation." ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On his territory, there are actually space nodes that have not been reported, what should I do if I am attacked by the church?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the direction of Vlad Castle made a loud noise, and the sound of an anger to the extreme was like a thunder:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill the bastard who is trapping me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes him angry is that he even has the other person, what he has done, what characteristics he has, all he does not know, even if he is looking for someone to use prophecy, Unable to trace.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignite the torch, Augustus has a picture Abandoned cities, large chimneys, metal pipes, bearings, pistons, springs, etc., show a distinct steam civilization.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to understand What is there, there are turbid tears in the corner of the eye, both like excitement and as if sorrowful: "This is the place where our ancestors came, this is our home, the embrace of our 'mother'! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he fell to the ground and kissed the weedy land filled with weeds: "We came back and finally came back!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwarf follows his majesty, kissing the ancestral land, the roots of the blood, crying and crying, and crying.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Harold and other members of the mechanical knights came over, the time and space door disappeared, and Augustus took a deep breath and shouted loudly to more than 20,000 dwarves: "Our destination is not here, we Go back to the earth, return to the hometown of our ancestors, return to the beginning of all the footprints, and return to the beginning of everything. There, we will be reborn! No more slavery, no more tragic death, no more painful new life! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, pick up the torch, follow me, don't hesitate, don't be afraid, don't doubt, follow me firmly, this is the revelation of the god of steam . ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is huge, and the torch is shining beyond the endless darkness. Only the piece of fluorescent moss reflects the green light, but this not only does not make the dwarves feel at ease, but makes them even more fearful. It seems that there are countless monsters hidden in the dark, and the green light is They are hungry and thirsty for blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quiet and abnormal in all directions, only the reverberation of the neat pace, the team seems to be caught in the eternal tranquility, never go out, never go through this article road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the dwarves began to panic and their legs and feet were soft, Augustus’s voice rang again: “Don’t hesitate, don’t be afraid, don’t doubt, follow firmly I!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The voices of the dwarves replied in an empty and empty way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus raised the scepter: "The God of Steam is with us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He will walk with us, no difficulty, no danger, no suffering, can overcome us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the name of the god of steam is heard, the dwarfs become bold Sufficient, silent in the heart of the holy name, it seems that every call, every prayer, the surrounding darkness and danger will retreat one point, and gradually, their pace is light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰, the steam rifle volley, a monster that only flew in the dark was beaten by the blood and turned to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we have the power of steam and will surely defeat all enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great God of Steam, the Lord of Life and Death, the King of Thunder, the Lord of Punishment, the God of Money..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the god of God, the king of kings..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred names all blurted out and intertwined into mixed The sounds, then slowly unify, converge into a torrent of power, which makes the dark "regress", let the monsters hiding in the dark choose to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge team finally got out of the city and walked out of the tunnel to the spider-like cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the final test. Only a pious person can pass the maze in front of you. Don't hesitate, don't be afraid, don't doubt, follow me firmly!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" This time, the dwarves were loud and confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost exactly the same rumors, the environment is completely different, the dwarves walk a little scared, afraid to get lost here, but the former Archbishop Augustus It seems that there is no way to distinguish between the eyes and the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust the great steam god, believe that the archbishop guided by Him, here is not to use the eyes, nose and ears to distinguish the road, but to use the soul! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea emerges in the hearts of every dwarf, so that they are no longer confused, no longer confused, and firmly follow the Archbishop in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, they suddenly had a slight light in front of them, and the front was a dense and vast forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the maze?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirna suddenly pointed at the sky and said: "Look there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark sky is white, A bright star in the distance guides the morning light and hangs in the sky. It flashes quietly and remains unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Morningstar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"During the day is coming?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves who grew up in the night plateau have never seen the daytime, and can only know the existence of Morning Star from the ancestral classics and Archbishop Augustus, knowing that it reveals the dawn . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning star disappeared, and the sky in the east lit up with a layer of orange light, bright and warm, and illuminating the heart. Then, a fireball slowly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful scenery that has never been seen has deeply shocked the dwarves and made them really feel the "newborn"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Archbishop Augustus shouted: “Our new students are about to begin, let us build a prosperous and strong land on Atlanti. Struggle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Struggling to build a prosperous and powerful Atlantis on the ground!" The dwarves screamed in unison, and more than 20,000 voices shook The mountains are soaring birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a passionate melody in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves looked at the past and saw a fat man in a black long trench coat with a soft hat leading a bunch of humans to this side, and the voice is From the small mechanical items held in his hand, it is engraved with a wonderful black pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dwarves panic, the Archbishop Augustus said: "This is the guide of the steam god, he will lead us to a new life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the dwarves who have embraced the god of steam are no longer afraid, watching the fat man quietly looking at it with a quirky look. Waiting for yourself, just like yourself and others, seeing ale and steam creation, the vampire sees the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Arthur Doyle, I will arrange a new life for you, a life many times better than the night plateau!" Arthur's fat face is full A smile. So many dwarves who are good at smelting and manufacturing are a huge asset, and many alchemy products have the potential to expand production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Arthur going down the hill, walking to the platform and seeing the long magic steam train, the dwarves cry again and again, which is really a paradise for steam. It is your own home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they looked around the magic steam train and looked at it. They wanted to take it apart and study it, and they wouldn’t be safe until they got on the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the guide of the steam god reminder a banker?" After the exchange, Mirna probably knew what the bank meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold is quite proud: "I said that the great god of steam is also the god of money, and it is normal for bankers to be his voters." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he showed a shock and yearning expression: "I saw a small silver coin turned into extreme horror under the current exerted by the god of steam. The amazingly fast shells... This makes me wonder if the direction of the steam civilization giant cannons has gone wrong. Should we combine currents to create new cannons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Oh, this is the new book given by the Lord." Augustus smiled and took out a book and handed it to Harold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold took a look and wrote: "The Foundation of Electrical Engineering." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur went to the last section of the train and sat in front of a young man in a black double-breasted long dress, graciously and implicitly: "Ivan I don’t think you can find such a lot of dwarves who are good at smelting and making.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is probably a future Arcanist. respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien swayed the teacup: "You have to be nice to them, give them enough salary and personal freedom. After all, I led them. After giving them a good foundation for alchemy, it allows them to pass the band and try to train a large number of skilled workers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the night plateau, due to the vampire prince left The attention of many powerful vampires was also attracted by the mysterious space, so things went very smoothly. Lucien used only the immortal throne robes to evoke the power of the dead and the newly created electromagnetic magic "Lusien's electromagnetic gun" The guide is complete - the current power of this magic is still small, but as the level increases, the voltage and magnetic field strength will improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, the person you arrange, I will be kind to you." Arthur did not hesitate to say a word about the god of steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
