			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireplace in the hall burned with flames, dispelling the harshness of the cold moon, and friends such as Heidi and Reyia lazily leaned back next to the lounge chair On the top, holding different books in the hand, while watching, while eating a variety of sweets. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are magic air conditioners installed in their rooms, which are warm in winter and cool in summer, but Heidi prefers the fireplace because the flames in the fireplace will bring her hair. The warmth of the heart is like a symbol of a real family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to be magic, and it’s not afraid to gain weight when eating sweets...” Heidi sat patted his belly in satisfaction, “fat burning” is more than just The enemy is useful, and if it is well controlled, the female magician is quite welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt a sense of her heart, directly short-distance teleported to the window, looked up at the sky, saw a meteor meteor across the sky, like a rain falling Beautiful and dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, meteor shower!" Heidi had the least resistance to this kind of beauty, shouting loudly to his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, her eyes suddenly condensed. According to the knowledge of astrology and force field, the position of this meteor shower is...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge!" She blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians on the high tower have also opened their mouths. In the previous observations and prophecies, should the meteor shower fall to the depths of the endless ocean? At that time, there will be a lot of magicians going out of the parliament to go there to find the extraterrestrial meteorites to enrich the materials of research and alchemy. But why did the trajectory suddenly change and the rainstorm hit the Aringe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge..." Brooke and Hathaway, who took Helen to guard the Sky City, noticed earlier than they did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Brooke wanted to fly directly, crushing the meteor shower in the sky, but the scale of the meteor shower was beyond imagination, plus the strange changes in the landings. He had a bad premonition and did not rush out to intercept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first level alarm, Allinge lock is fully open." Next to Hathaway calmly inspired the corresponding magic array, "defense-based, and use Rays and lasers magically destroy any meteors that might hit Rentaut and nearby areas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in things allowed her to raise the level of alert by one level Otherwise, this kind of natural disaster-like attack is at most two levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook then told the still-connected half-plane: "The magic tower defense array of each division is fully open, the guardian legend will expand the warning range, and the rest of the legends immediately Come to Allinge and prepare for the rescue and rescue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try to inform the legend of going out and gather all the power..." Hathaway added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arranged the countermeasures in an orderly manner and informed the people of Douglas, Lucien and others in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge "raindrop" with dazzling light, dragging a bright tail, whistling to Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Allinge was filled with a thick mist, making the "city of the sky" like a dream, not a real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars of the stars rise from this fog, and they form a vast starry sky around Aringe, each occupying a certain position, according to the specific The trajectory works to form a different magical array, and these magical layers are superimposed and finally become a whole, a powerful and horrible whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final form of the "Arien Lock". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "raindrops" are getting brighter and brighter, and a huge flaming stone smashing into the starry sky filled with fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars are getting more and more stunned, and the fog is smashing, but the meteorite has no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "raindrop" of a "drop" meteor is falling with the demise of the world, and the fog in the Aringe locks shrinks and expands. Uncertain, with some stars extinguished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the edge of the "Rainstorm as a note", a meteor crossed from the lock of Allinge, fell to the nearby village, and fell to Rentat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, within the foggy starry sky around Aringe, a red and thick light suddenly shot, not condensed, and then sent first, first hit Above the meteor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, this meteor disappeared as if it were burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red laser and the green ray are constantly being played out of the lock, destroying the meteors that may have hit the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the citizens of Rentat have found that the defensive array of the whole city has opened, and looked up at the sky, just to see the meteor falling, The scene of the laser like a thorn is so shocking that it can't be said, which is ten thousand times more powerful than the magical war scene described by the bard and the drama! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most meteors can't be a lasting rainstorm, after a wave, gradually sparse, just as the magicians in Aringe are a little relieved, A meteor that seems to be burning his own life passes through the atmosphere, and a sacred radiance shines through the body, illuminating most of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meteor has more power than all previous collections, like the penalty of heaven, the punishment of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict III!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicken..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different names are shouted from Brooke, Hathaway, Begner, Oliver, etc. This power can only come from the hands of the gods, even the northern churches that can use the gods The Pope can't do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements bless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magnetic field collapse!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the ball!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-gravitational field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They vibrate to vibrate, but they do not affect their own reactions, one by one, the magic of magic, one by one, the magical array of magic, the collection of Alin All of the current forces are fighting against the "God's punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a magical array of stress in front of Brooke and Hathaway There is a light curtain with a scene on the orbit of the planet. A little white light emerges, highlighting the members of the cardinal group such as Melmos and Philip, who are flying towards "Brook and Hathaway". ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case of a man-made planet, so their goal is not "Brook and Hathaway" but "artificial planet"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making chaos leads the enemy, distracting the enemy’s power, and then taking the opportunity to slow down so that even if they react, they will not be able to rescue. The plan formulated, although simple, is very effective, and no one can dare to ignore the shot of a kind of god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the suddenness of the "Abyss Will" in the Northland made him even more happy, and he felt that he was 100%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods of the meteor seem to carry the "spirit" will, come crashing, vow to destroy everything, which makes Brooke, Hathaway and others simply unable to shoot, It is also impossible to withdraw the locks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods met the meteor hit the Allinge lock, the huge explosion sounded, the colorful elements sheltered the light layer instantly broken, the anti-gravitation field was also in the milk white There is no trace of light under the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark twisted magnetic field is broken, the stars are broken, the magical array is broken, and the fog is also torn apart. <br /><br />################################################################################################## Brooke looked at the air, seeming to see the pope Viking standing proudly on the edge of the planet through layers of atmosphere and darkness. He held the Platinum Scepter and walked slowly, disappearing in place before the Silver Moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
