			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alto Musicians Association Hall is as bright and quiet as ever, because no matter where it is, musicians come from other members of the association. It is said that they are very rare. The musicians are busy with the work of their orchestras and bands, unless they need to borrow quiet and complete piano practice, or cooperate with musicians to rehearse in the fifth floor concert hall and go to the music library to find music scores, books, etc. Very few have arrived in the association early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the creation and practice of music is very quiet, and the Musicians Association has never tried to turn itself into a lively place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the lobby reception desk is two sweet and pretty, blond girls who can make a pleasant mood at a glance, they are sternly with their own boss Mr. Hank, who is in charge of the regular affairs of the association, spoke, and the tall and serious Hank smiled and pointed to a young and beautiful girl around him to tell them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is about twenty years old, and has an impressive black waterfall with long hair and exquisite appearance, which can make people more impressive. It was a white wolf with a soft white hair and a mighty savage beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Louise, we will ask other musicians for you, if any of your husbands or ladies think they have research on natural music, then tell you. "The girl with the ordinary name Polly respectfully respects the new musicians in front of me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is really an enviable and long-awaited object, born in a noble family, has a musical talent since childhood, earned money by inheriting the inheritance and earning money from participating in the performance. The wealth required for the Holy Water inspired the strange blood of nature and animals, which in turn greatly improved her playing ability and finally became famous at this festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Polly, what I really admire is Miss Elena, because she starts from the ordinary reception girl like them, by herself. The efforts to give up have become a musician with a high income and a low status in the citizen class, and it is the most worthy study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise smiled nodded and politely said: "Thank you, because the music in this area is rarely heard in Aalto, so I don't know Mr. Hank. Which gentleman or woman is good at it, you can only ask one by one after you meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the door with the stained glass was pushed away. A young man in a black dress and a bow tie walked in unhurriedly, surrounded by young musicians and musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?" Polly has been working for the Musicians Association for a year, but she has never met a handsome man who looks good. It’s the few gentlemen behind him, she knows. But even if she didn't know, she vaguely felt that she was familiar, as if she had seen it far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanke, who was subconsciously looking back, was a glimpse, then a serious smile on his serious face, and hurriedly greeted him: "Mr. Evans, welcome back!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mr. Evans?!" was reminded by Mr. Hank that both Polly and her companions woke up, three years ago. At the Alto Music Festival, I saw the commanding style of Mr. Evans’s subversion and the piano performance of the artist’s name in the Municipal Square. He was deeply impressed by his elegance and madness. If it was not a long time, then he was young and he was so slow. Only reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Hank." Lucien smiled and nodded to Hank, and for three years, when he faced himself, Mr. Hank seemed to be getting more and more Passionate and polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien while greeting and walking towards the reception desk, Polly both excited and bowed very respectfully: "Good morning, Mr. Evans Louise next to "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also slightly excited: "Good morning, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girls of their age are listening to Lucien’s music through “adolescence”, and naturally have an indescribable respect and admiration for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien kept a polite smile and looked at the white wolf with Louise's feet and two ears up: "Are you Miss Louise?" On the way back, I heard people’s arguments and heard your music, well, very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank you, Mr. Evans, I still have a lot to learn.” Louise’s face was grateful, because Lucien’s big musician of this rank was a polite compliment, for the newcomers, It can bring about the consolidation and promotion of status, and Lucien is in the forefront of the younger generation, and the object of his reverence is definitely the biggest award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After greetings with Hank and Louise, Lucien looked at Polly and said: "Hello, my teacher, Mr. Victor. In the association? Is President Christopher in the association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the last concert, Christopher served as honorary president. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Evans." Polly was excited to say hello a little harder. "Mr. Victor is currently a council member and will be dealt with after the festival." A lot of things, so I arrived at the association early in the morning. President Christopher came to the association every day and seemed to have a new direction of creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien gently jaws, no wonder Natasha told herself to come to the Musicians Association first, it seems that she is very clear that Mr. Victor and President Christopher are likely to be here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked Felice, Elena and others, and found that they have not yet arrived in the association, Lucien led by Hank, toward Walk on the third floor of Victor's lounge and office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Evans." All the way, Lucy’s previously familiar musicians were very polite and respectful. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving Aalto, how much success has been achieved by Sean, how much praise he has received, and his experience from the poor boy to the great musician Musicians and musicians, for a moment, it’s hard to forget the music library watcher, the beginner who played the piano bumps... always overlay these images with the successful Lucian, that is Fame is too fast, giving people a feeling of "upstart". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years, time has precipitated, Lucien has not only fallen as quickly as many geniuses, and the two piano sonatas created have remained above the standard. It is excellent, especially the "Moonlight Sonata" is a classic, known as the most beautiful piano music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien never returning to Aalto, giving the musicians association people a lot of imagination and "brain-filling" space, so when Lucien When they set foot here again, in their hearts, Lucien had completed the transformation of talented musicians to big musicians, and was a great music figure who must be given enough respect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, watching Lucien disappear with the Hank on the stairs, Polly licked her face with both hands, excitedly said to her companion: "Mr. Evans More temperament than I imagined, but also elegant, I don't know what kind of music he will bring back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what will Mr. Evans bring back? Music?” This is the idea that Louise and other young musicians and musicians share. It’s really exciting. It seems to be more exciting than the previous Aalto Festival! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "I don't think President Christopher still has a strong creative passion." When he walked to the third floor, Lucien smiled with Han. Ke chat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank smiled enthusiastically: "The president of Christopher has already held the last concert, but the creation has never stopped, using his own words. That is to say, life is endless, music is not limited. Hehe, after hearing the solemn sacred music at the festival, he has inspiration and wants to create a religious music, but unfortunately there are too many classic works in this area. It’s too difficult to write satisfaction, and there’s been no progress.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the theme music trend brought by Lucien, the pure music that occupies music is occupied The mainstream, but more mainstream than it is religious music. This is the eternal theme of Aalto's eternal after Charles Di, the then Cardinal's sacred norm. It used to be, and now, Lucien can see the future for a long time. Therefore, there are a lot of classic works, and it is very difficult to surpass the predecessors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Religious music..." Lucien nodded thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked with [***] and soon arrived at Victor’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, knock on the door yourself and give the Victor director a surprise." Hank smiled and suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
