			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien fainted, lying on the ground with pain and looking at the sun without the blazing sun, and the clear blue sky, quietly breathing fresh The air, the pain of the flesh can not cover the guilt of Lucien's heart, and the solidity and tenacity of the real goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making the decision to learn magic, Lucien is more cautious and cautious about the future, but like putting down his heart for a long time. Stone, there is a pleasant pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a strange, complicated and abnormal psychological activity." Just a few days more than the past twenty years, more than Lucien, as if mature When I got up, I buried my anger and powerlessness in my heart and laughed at myself. "Maybe, from the beginning, I was eager to learn magic, master extraordinary power, get a better life, and have a higher status. A few days have only helped me to make up my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice ran to Lucien and helped him up: "Little Evans, No problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tried to move his hands and feet and hurt his teeth: "Nothing, Eliza, they are I didn't want to kill me, just some minor injuries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was relieved, cursing, "Those damn villains, ignoring the law of the Grand Duke The rogue will surely be hanged and will definitely go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While cursing the Aaron gangster, Lisa while Lucien will help to their home to sit down, take water to wash his bloody face, and to help him stop the bleeding with a clean linen cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Eliza was in the waist and looked at Lucien, going to ask what happened, but before asking for the exit She suddenly thought of another thing, so she took a look at Lucien: "Today is Monday, Little John will come back in the afternoon, you must never tell him about it. Little Evans, you know He has an unusual love for the knight spirit and the code. You are his good friend. If he knows, he will probably go to the trouble of the Aaron gang. If things are too big, maybe they will be Sir escaping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a poor, Eliza is used to putting her side in a weak position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I haven’t done anything big, I’ll be glaring at John’s, hehe.” Although Lucien is powerless now, I believe he will be able to recover it later. Fair, let the gang get the end of the application, so I did not care to smile and promised, and the result reached the corner of the broken mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice has nodded with tears: "Little Evans, you are so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What are you going to look at me?" Suddenly, John’s voice full of magnetic names sounded like a gray knight’s suit. He didn’t know when he was standing at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is flustered: "No, nothing, little John, are you coming back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;John walked into the house with his slender legs, and smiled bitterly: "The Grand Duke has summoned Sir Wien, so I followed Aalto, Mom, don't say such a bad lie, I am an adult, It is a formal knight attendant, learning and experiencing a lot of things with Sir Wien, no longer a naive child, don't worry that I will be reckless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Elissa finished, John smiled and looked at Lucien, and took a picture with both hands. He said with a gentle and calm attitude: "The way you look now is much worse than when we used to be jealous. Ok, let me know. Well, I think many neighbors should see what happened just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned to look at Eliza and glanced at her. Frustrated, nodded, and then said things locally, and at this time, from John. Lucien actually feel a Gary Correa and other personnel to their oppressive force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing behind, John showed an angry expression, but did not lose his mind, quickly calmed down and smiled: "It seems that Lucien is true. I want to learn the text. But your mind is really the best of us, and you can think of finding valuable garbage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that John is not angry, Full of knightly spirits to find Aaron gangs trouble, Eliza sighed with a long sigh of relief: "Little Evans, you have your own ideas and efforts are the best."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his head. "Mom, let me go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little John..." Eliza shouted painfully. "You will be Wien like this." The jazz was driven out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was busy: "John, nothing, I am just a little hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp John shook his head: "After becoming the official servant of Sir Wien, he often taught us to keep the rules of the knight, to carry forward the knightly spirit, to resist the violence, to protect the weak, to guard the homeland, to hold the banner of justice and truth. Other companions may not care much, but I think this is the way I am willing to believe in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien is my good friend, weak The poor, the Aaron gang is a villain, a rogue composed of evil, if I do not stand out, contrary to the rules of my heart, even if not driven out by Sir Wien, such annoyance will entangle my heart, so that I will never Inspire the blood in the body, and I believe that Sir Wien will agree with my behavior. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" however, little John ...... "Alissa Aunt John was reluctant to leave, a look of sadness. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; John gently laughed, hugged Alissa: "Lucien was just beating, grab something, so I will not do Things that go beyond the limits will not make things big. Mom, believe me, you see, I just hold the stick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of comfort, and The convincing power of John's official knight's servant status finally allowed Alisa to agree that she nodded in a difficult position: "Little John, you must be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They are careful. Lucian, waiting for the good news." John held the stick and smiled confidently, and he was going to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Lucian’s voice suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John looked back at him strangely: "What? Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En stood up, John's behavior made him very moved, and there seemed to be a blood in his heart, smiling: "Together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although because of the breach of the corner of the mouth It was funny to let Lucien's smile, but John still saw Lucien's firmness, so he refused, and he laughed: "No problem, just like a child, well, there is a stick in the kitchen." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien found out the stick and put it in his hand. When he passed through Eliza, he whispered comfortably: "I will look at John, no. It will make him messy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and other talents are not long John and Lucien easily know their whereabouts from the neighbors and the road population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was chasing away, John suddenly said: "Lu Xien, do you believe in justice?" The voice seems a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, believe, what's wrong?" Lucien didn't know why John asked this question, and used the surname to answer carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John said while he was on the road: "I also believe in justice, but I understand that I am not as noble and fearless as I said, if you are not my good. Friends, I am afraid I will not stick to the spirit of the Cavaliers, and then hold the banner of justice to deal with the Aaron gang. I will get used to measuring my strength. Once I find that it is likely to threaten my life and future, I will cringe, not Dare to move forward, unless this is a major event that affects my family and friends. Perhaps justice is just a slogan for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think so Every knight has his own highest priority, some are fair, some are loyal, some are fearless, some are pity, and you are choosing a home. Only by choosing the guardian can you talk about justice, otherwise justice is Unsettled, imaginary symbol without any substance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien felt that John was still a young man who was a bit green. on Himself, while flipping through a complaint about chivalry literature in mind, organize the language to appease him, yanking him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
