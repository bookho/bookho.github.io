			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half of the mountain covered with cracks is crushed by rocks and mud, and almost no traces of the circuits and symbols are complete. All of them are incomplete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen magicians lived in this “city” that was completely destroyed, and they were so few that they could not bring a little anger to this place. It was still cold and silent, like a graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge..." Douglas floating in the middle of the mountain whispered its name in the language of Ilvanus, even if it had already seen it. Once, at this time, it is still impossible to resolve the shock, and it is difficult to restrain the inner excitement and urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly flew to the ground of Allinge, and under the guidance of several wizards, he walked into the central magic with only one-third The tower, along the long ramp, goes deep into the interior of the "City of the Sky", where it has the core of all mysteries, the source of flight power, and of course, they are so devastating that they cannot directly see what they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The study is beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths, Douglas said to himself, One of the main reasons why he chose to come to the Holm Kingdom instead of Aalto was that he had the dream city he had dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether waking up or dreaming, I have been entangled in his many years of questions and will get the best answer here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping on the gray stone steps, he walked step by step, and the figure gradually disappeared into the darkness of the hole, and everything went to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before the early morning is especially dark, as if there is no light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heart of Time" Ketonia sits in the hall of his villa. On the knee is a long sword that flashes in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "God of Grace" Franz's laborious treatment, he has got rid of the remnant curse and restored his body, but his blood is weak but ordinary The Cavaliers can see that it will take at least some time to restore their peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ketonia, is the ‘death lord’ not old?” A gust of wind blew, and a slight sarcasm sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible wind of the group, condensed a thin man, his hair. His skin. Every line on his body gives the impression that the wind is blowing, so no matter the hair color. Still twilight. He is all peculiarly translucent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raymond. He is old, but do you dare to fight him once?" Ketonia replied faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This epic knight is currently the Grand Duke of the Principality of Calais, "The Wind of Endlessness" Raymond. The Principality of Calais belongs to the original Arthurian empire. Therefore, he has a deep-rooted awe of the "death lord". After hearing that he and his own "heart of time" have been hit hard, he deliberately mocked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Raymond sat on the sofa next to him. "Franks let us move and make me forget the hidden mice." The lesson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was commanded by the "God of Grace" and the remaining epic knights were on their way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not let us move, but let you cooperate with me." "The Heart of Time" Ketonia raised his head arrogantly, with a young and energetic face With a faint contempt, "I am a person who is deeply loved by the Lord. It is the strongest knight outside the king, so the Lord loves me. The church believes in me and allows me to rule you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't we be ignorant of the Lord?" Raymond retorted, and he always knew that Ketonia was arrogant, but never thought that one day he could talk and hard to hear this. Degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the command of the "God of Grace", you can only obey!" Ketonia stood on the side of the church and completely regarded other epic knights. Subordinate attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a puppy, it's the Lamb of the Lord. We servants want to know how to imprison them." Ketonia still replied arrogantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, very good! Don't forget that you are also a noble knight!" Raymond didn't hit a place, almost got rid of the git guy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia gave him a sneak look: "I can be a paladin at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You!" Raymond decided to use battle to defend his dignity and glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the door was pushed away again, and a group of darkness hidden like countless disasters came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Raymond once again held back the urge to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious Cathedral, arranged in a room with a transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Angel of the Angels" Franz has been here, the first time to grasp the news from Lance, and ready to return to the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They killed Alfonso and made a fortune after Cretona. It will definitely hide and hide from our cleansing, so during this time, as long as we don't In chaos, the situation will be relatively stable.” Franz pointed to the cardinal next to him – the new takeover of the court of Kanuel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canuel crouched down and respectfully said: "Yes, the adult you expected is very accurate, I just received an important person's information, 'Death lord 'The command to the magician union, the Tower of the Destroyer, the Soul to the High, and the magical organization is: 'When the church's counter-attack wave subsides down and discuss other things.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Very good." Franz gently daggers, and turns to continue to look at the transmission array of constant light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mist that appears in a transparent face surrounds a tip Towering magic tower, this magic tower is dark in color, like a tombstone, only the lowest layer has a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light comes from a silver candlestick, and the "death lord" under the cloak, Tananos quietly looks at the books that are not open before him. There are dozens of peculiar words written on it, which seem to come from the Mesquite Empire: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secret Study of the First Body by the Wizards of the Past Dynasties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long trek, Fernando landed on the ground, here is the holy city In the northwest direction of Lance, close to the Tria location of the Great War, it is the region with the most legendary strong, so he did not dare to fly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long and narrow strip, and the southeast is the holy city of Lance. The northeast is the northern province of the sacred Helz Empire, the southwest is the last base of the magical empire of Aalto, the Trinity front in the northwest, the ally of the church of truth in the north, the paganism of the goddess of the earth, and the church of truth in the north. Fully controlled Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King of Angels, Griffith, Ivan, Rudolf, the four legendary peaks, plus the 'Sword of Truth' that is not inferior to the legendary peaks And the 'Shield of Truth', and five blazing angels, more than eight third-order saints, and the number of suppressing the cardinal of the coalition, epic. Even without the pope. The strength of the church is horrible enough to fight against all forces outside of them Not to mention the help of allies such as the Mother Earth God..." Fernando turned into a mouse, carefully walking through the area, thinking about the information he had received during this time. A little frustrated. A little angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not considered a Saints and Cardinals, epic knights who have not joined the Western War! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to put the devil of the hell and the demon of the abyss in. Can you hope to defeat the church?" Fernando thought in a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he found that the tallest building in the city ahead began to sway violently, and the church ruled. The tallest building can only be the cathedral! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
