Angus did not understand Ador's words too much, but when he mentioned the name Maskillin, his tone It also became quite dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pale sunshine, Ador’s delicate but dead skin is shrouded in a layer of faint black air, and two red rays blaze below the hood "The talisman on his body was made by Muskilllin's special technique. Hey, he can sense me with a talisman, why can't I recognize the origin of his talisman?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the last time you were secretly revealed to Sosa, isn’t it for Felipe? Isn’t it to provoke the guilt of the pale hand?” Angus stood up and caught a piece of rotten Drop the muscles and then lick it into the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stupid people, greed, stubbornness blinded their hearts, and we played in the palm of our hands." Ador gave a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angus's voice became haze: "Maskirin knows too much of our secrets, and is a powerful prophet, astrology master, he stays The purpose of the item is definitely not simple. Since the magician named Lucien Evans is coming to Heidele to receive the prize, do we want it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was more than a gesture of pinching his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idiot, have you ever thought about the consequences of doing it in the city of Heidler? Do you want to reveal the secrets of the dead world? You want to be naked in the dead world Shown in front of the Magic Council? A great Arcanist, a legendary magician, we still have the confidence to deal with, can face seven arcane masters, eleven legendary magicians, what do we take to compete? Don't forget Our goal is not just the Magic Council!” Ador was shouting in a cold voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you allowed to live a guy who may reveal our secrets at any time?" Angus replied angrily, although he was not as good as Ador, but also The high-order undead is not the object that he can insult at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adol turned his head and the red spot under the shadow of the hood jumped twice: "If he wants to leak, he has already leaked it. Master this." After the secret, the leak is more dangerous than the secret, because the strong who knows the secrets of the dead spirit will definitely let him shut up forever. Since the Magic Council has not had this movement, it means that Lucien Evans is very cautious. "Smart people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he wants to leak, I am afraid I have to wait until I become a legendary magician. After having enough self-protection strength, our time is still very good." Hey, he can't go out and explore the world, and he can't be as big as the last time he went out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Angus still wants What to say, Ador warned: "The most important thing we have at the moment is to extract 'power' and prepare for the return of the 'master'. Angus, you should not act arbitrarily and disrupt the plan, otherwise you will Waiting to be put into the 'soul fireplace'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, A Doyle adults. "Engelhard ust put my hood, bow answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The element will be the Allinge Division, the first floor of the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien, he walked down the podium in the applause, and behind it came Morris to ease the sound of heartache:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Below, let's ask Mr. Larry Clarke to come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry wearing elemental robes is slightly nervous Going out of the crowd and coming over to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, Mr. Larry." Lucien smiled when he came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry touched his own tan bear with a slap in the face: "Thank you, Evans, the weather is really good today."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is excited and incoherent? Lucine laughed sideways and looked at Larry on the podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Congratulations, the pride of our elemental will, the unprecedented winner of the three Holm crown awards." Florensa held the wine glass close together and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien flipped his hands to reveal a few rings: "Thank you for your thoughtful design by Ms. Florencia."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, all he arranged?" Lucien frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien returned to Allinge, a thorough investigation of Barack began, because Lucien always felt that things were too coincidental, why Bellak can Grasp the time when I found the curse of the vase, is there anyone else who is cooperating with him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the results of the Panel’s findings just heard, Barack only chose the time when he found the vase cursing the most – if not in the first few days It is found that 90% of the cases may not be found, even if the symptoms begin to be suspected in the future, it is a long process, and Bellak has plenty of time to prepare. As for the accidental discovery, it is not in Barak. In consideration, the grasp of no assassination is 100%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa nodded lightly, and the long blond hair shook: "As far as the current situation is concerned, no other high-level cooperation has been found, but other There has been significant progress. We found Loban in the magic tower of Barak. From his 'memory' and other information left by Barak, we captured more than a dozen low-level magicians who all trusted in the church. Some are because the strength is stagnant or the situation is not good, from the faith to seek the quiet of the soul, gradually become a mad believer, and some simply plot money, materials, etc., for their own better development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as there is death, there is pain, there is despair and difficulty, religion can't be banned, but we can't compromise with the church. All religions must be under our control. In the middle." Lu Xien was quite emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa groaned, then giggled, smiled and leaned forward, his body trembled like a squid: "Lu Xien, no, Commissioner Evans, you have more and more members' temperament, and the tone is exactly the same as that of Douglas Speaker and Fernando!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slightly I shifted the topic in a joking manner: "Is it? I can say that I am still considering whether to suggest the establishment of the 'Caring for the Wizards Growth and Mental Health Working Committee'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Care for the Wizards Growth and Mental Health Working Committee, haha, this is the right of the commissioner!" Florensa, who was amused by Lucien's bizarre name, stopped the laughter for a long time, while Larry A short speech has begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking a mouthful of wine and moistening the throat of a dry smile, Florenza used the message: "You privately asked for the investigation of the source of special materials. There has been some progress. Although it is the material provided by the church to Barak, this material is very special, we have already got some clues, and we are sending people to the desert secret investigation in the south of the Gusta Empire."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really good news." Lucien laughed heartily, whether it was arcane research, cursing magic and extreme cold rays, or creating other horror in the future. 'This is an indispensable material and the origin of the mineral must be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa’s crystal clear eyes stare at Lucien, using “transportation”: “Special materials are new elements, but they have Is it so important? What else have you discovered?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the Lucian paper was not sealed, that is, the new element “Uranium” was found and measured a lot. In the data part, I got 30 Arcane points. At this time, I heard that Florenza’s question can only be laughed and not spoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensha has a strong curiosity, but can restrain himself better, see Lucien refused to say, had to play his own imagination: "噢, my poor teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ended their conversation and turned to look at the stage and listened to Larry’s speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry’s tension began to calm down, and the voice gradually became smoother:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned, there is an inevitable law behind any accident, so I am thinking about why the substance dissolves into ions with different charges, why the elements will have a valence state, and why the valence state will show the cycle name. Change, does this have anything to do with the internal structure of the atom? Is it related to the newly discovered electrons of Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the world of arcane, If there is a result, there must be a reason. Any phenomenon is strictly determined by the law, so we cannot satisfy the acquisition of the result and the surface phenomenon, and we must conduct a deeper exploration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
