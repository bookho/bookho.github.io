			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Add a chapter, thank you<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;........................... ................................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only four notes, that are full of special names Tone, and the rhythm of accent, it is like fate or death is knocking on everyone's door, no one can escape, no one can escape, just from them seems to be able to anticipate the whole piece of music Theme, a theme that fully supports the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next horn change, develops a similar, clear and powerful second theme, that is, the determination and will to fight fiercely with the dark forces under destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first theme and the second theme are fiercely engaged, as if it is difficult, dangerous and desperate, and the heroes can only support, the melody is heated and depressed. And the horror, most of the aristocrats who did not go through the battle, only rely on their superior blood, and the musicians who are ordinary people clenched their fists and leaned back on the chair, as if they could not withstand the intense To the ultimate melody, can not withstand the blow of darkness, such as the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, Wolff and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of the nobles who have experienced wars with dark creatures and pagans, like Sir Wien, who is next to the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, are dignified and urgent, as if Going back to the battlefield that made me remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde is still calm, but his half-closed eyes have been opened, his eyes are no longer cloudy, but full of sharp light, seems to think of himself Experience when young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same has not experienced a large-scale, real war, Verdi and Natasha's performance is completely different, Verdi's right hand clenched his fist across the abdomen, The whole person exudes a heavy and unbreakable atmosphere, which makes people think of the Violet family's "Shield of Truth" at a glance, while Natasha is leaning forward, his face full of fighting desire and will, seems to want to darken Charge the fate and defeat them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A period of passionate, shocking melody continues to spread, blending into the feelings, blending into the past life experience of Victor, the command is very committed, and this The symphony of destiny has been thoroughly perfected when playing with Lucien. The first theme "The oppression of destiny and darkness" and the second theme "Never give up and struggle with difficulties" are getting stronger and stronger until the climax Only ended with a temporary victory in fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the nobility and musicians who can no longer withstand this fierce melody to finally relax a little, only Natasha waved his arms a little dissatisfied. It seems to be angry at not yet defeating the fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second movement is also the alternating theme of the viola, cello and wood tube, brass instruments, but lyrical, serene, contemplative and heroic, Showing the will and confidence of the warrior, whether it is music or the courage of the audience, it is a little bit inspired. The heroic spirit has infected more and more people, and the expressions on the faces of nobles and musicians have become more exciting. Both nervous and looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a symphony that will make them feel so ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third movement returns to the sinister, fierce destiny and darkness of change, and the melodies of depression, suffering, and danger are like a spurt of arrows Shooting, but the inspiring theme of never being defeated by difficulties and never yielding to the darkness still makes the audience see a little hope when they are extremely nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha’s slender legs are slightly curved, like a cheetah ready to go, to defeat the darkness and destiny, this symphony seems to be Most impressed her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the glare pierced the darkness, the exciting triumphant movement screamed brilliantly and magnificently, Waorit’s Grand Duke sighed and violently waved Arms, like welcoming themselves to overcome the darkness, the triumphant return of the Knights, including other nobles including Verdi, is also an expression of excitement, Natasha stood up and walked to the edge of the box, holding Looking at the band with a railing and an uplifting emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia and other musicians, after experiencing dramatic changes in emotions, are comfortably and relaxed on the back of the chair, and can’t help but watch each other. At a glance, with surprise, shock and affirmation, they already know from the music list that this is a newcomer's work, but this work is unexpectedly outstanding and can even be called great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this gorgeous, triumphant movement, Wolf, who has come back to God, is not only ugly to describe, but as if he is dying, because even his critic and malicious critics can’t Deceiving yourself is a poor or general work: "Victor students are really unimaginable musical geniuses. No wonder he will accept a poor person as a student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He looked at Othello’s director with anxiety and uneasiness, and looked inside the box, hoping that the aristocrats and bishops who did not like the theme music could give a severe comment after the end. This is his last chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, John, and Elena, they didn’t expect Lucien’s music to be so good, and they’ve been completely immersed in the atmosphere of music. In the middle of the music, the mood changes with the tension and excitement of the music, and there is no thought to think about the extra things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is fully integrated into the music, showing his emotions unreservedly, and finally twitching the band to complete the final climax, the darkness is completely dispelled The hero is completely triumphant, never give up, never sighs with difficulty and bows in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Ouerit couldn’t help but be excited. While screaming, he stood up and walked to the front railing of the box, and accompanied Natasha to the band. Pay tribute and pay tribute to Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not necessary for Dagong to take the lead. Before him, the tide of loud applause has come from all directions and resounded throughout the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporate the feelings to infect the audience and make them emotionally ups and downs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concert has undoubtedly been a great success! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor right hand presses on the chest, returns to the box, then walks back to the backstage, pulls Lu Xien and goes outside, Lu Xien has Prepared, did not resist, calmly followed Victor to the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gentlemen, ladies, let me introduce my student, he is Lucien Evans, who created the excitement just now. The music of the heart." Victor said loudly to the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause became more intense and loud, and the nobles and musicians applauded and excitedly exchanged: "It’s a genius, this is an unprecedented music. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great music, great young man." Earl of Hein praised the truth and said in a low voice, "Even if I don't The people who understand music are also impressed by it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wariot’s grandfather screams: “Unbeatable symphony, young people, you can be Excellent, even great musicians. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he finished, Natasha did not use force, but the voice echoed in the hall: "I can't express my feelings in words, but from this In the works, I felt something unusual. This is the music that I have been pursuing all the time. There are music with complete emotional themes. Many of the writing techniques are intoxicating. Lucien, you will be a changer in the history of music! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wardi after the end of the music, he couldn’t help himself applauding until Natasha finished, and his face changed slightly, and he was really better than Not a person who only studied music for three months, this feeling made him a little uncomfortable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde is like a real old man standing up When I got up, I looked at Lucien with a smile: "Young people, you have an unyielding soul. May the Lord bless you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three most powerful people of Aalto have expressed their appreciation for the music and Lu Xien to varying degrees, so the applause is more intense and enduring. Joel and others are completely awakened.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer screams wildly, just like Lucy, who is performing and accepting praise in the Hall of the Holy Spirit, It was his own. Since Lucien began to study music, Joel pinned his unfulfilled dreams on him, but he did not expect it to be so fast, his eyes were flashing.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien is awesome and progress far exceeds me. "John is excited by the success of his friend, and his face is applauding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena is unbelievably looking at Lucien below, it seems difficult Imagine that the poor young people who are still carrying garbage a few months ago can actually write the symphony that they think is the best, and they have become outstanding musicians who are praised by everyone:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
