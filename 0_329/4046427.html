			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the space jump to the hill near Alinge, Lucien immediately took out the crystal ball, in the sky where the stars faded and the silver moon sinks. Next, astrology was performed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball becomes faint and deep, and the stars are shining. When the star of the destiny representing Natasha is still shining, Lucien Only a long sigh of relief, nothing is fine, nothing is fine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relaxed by Wayne, this is the mood to look at the East, watching the orange sun rise and lit a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, light from the dark mountains and Alinhe can sometimes be judged to be basically spherical, not to mention the existence of the sea level and the horizon. ..." Lucien suddenly raised the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last use of the reel, Lucien confirmed from the teacher storm to the space jump only half an hour, then compare the previous morning silver hour high It is not difficult to think of the jet lag in the dark mountains that hang and the Aringe that has just fallen behind the silver moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, arcaneists have never doubted Douglas's celestial system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can you not see the world after flying into space? Can't find a planet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luisen shook his head and threw the problem that had plagued the Magic Council for many years. He vacated and flew toward Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landing on the edge of Aringe, Lu Xien’s family did not return, directly applied himself to the acceleration, fully exerted the ability of the moonlight, and dragged the Shadow, rushed to the magic tower of the parliament headquarters, took the lift, and rushed into the study of the teacher Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is still the bright red magic robe, holding a magic book to the claws holding a large pen Afris to explain the spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduced Aphrodite squatted on the floor, just over the desk, and the posture was quite comfortable, with a serious look that Lucien had never seen before. Learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are back...the things before dawn are related to you?" When Lucien entered the magic tower, Fernando knew his return, and dozens Just a minute before the change of the blushing month, Lucien returned to the Magic Council. If anyone dared to say that there was no connection between the two, Fernando would certainly scream at his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I summoned the god of the silver moon, Aitna, to help a friend get out of trouble, and the result was met with the vampire prince Dracula, and I was unexpected. The change is not clear what happened in the end." Lucian said that the truth is completely complete, but the information of the dead world is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be that a first-generation vampire was trapped by Prince Dracula, and then asked Lucien to summon the god of the silver moon to release the seal. Who knows that there is a mysterious existence behind Dracula that is enough to compete with the ancestors of the blood family, and unimaginable changes have taken place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Lucien really didn’t know what was going on at the time, only by guessing about the world of the dead, faintly guessing, and Nine true and implicit narratives are the easiest to deceive the past and not be caught by loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this also needs to take a little risk, if it is not this time to make such a big move, the vision is too exaggerated, and the use of space jump reels is to use The half-level plane dominated by the storm, he can certainly reverse the fact that he was in the dark mountains at the time. Lucien relied on the fate of the secret surname, and he used this hard work to excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after going through the previous things, Lucien felt that the teacher was still trustworthy, even if the secret of the dead spirit was discovered by him, he should not be ruined. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has always been serious and violent when he was in serious trouble. At this time, he tapped the desk gently: "It’s the observer, the Earl of Silvereye is trapped. Only he can summon the god of the silver moon, Aitna. Well, this is actually a good opportunity for you. When Aitna comes down, you should be briefly influenced by him, from where he is. The position sees the world. This is a perspective that others cannot provide. After all, He is the closest to the 'real' existence, and is the research goal that every Arcanian is difficult to circumvent. This kind of experience is for you now. Say maybe there is no feeling, but after you have the chance to step into the legendary field, it is a rare wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien did not conceal, because he was also ignorant at the time, and there was a teacher who could provide a reference. Maybe it could be transformed into a accumulation of knowledge and cognitive world: "It is a perspective of looking at everything after the soul is elevated, and it seems to be There are a lot of ambiguous scenes that cannot be described, such as covering a variety of possible developments..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the lips, Lucien discovered the feeling experience Too vague and too complicated, it is completely impossible to describe clearly in language, only some impressions remain in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uplifting, looking down, development possible..." Fernando's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, not surely guessing, "rumors are close to 'real' or others say 'spirit' At the time, there will be an improvement in the nature of the surname, and we can directly see the trajectory of fate from another perspective, but it is not quite like, grace, unlike... Lu Xien, such a harvest belongs to you, only waiting for you. When you are promoted to the legend, when you encounter similar difficulties, the vague impression will become clearer in combination with the specific problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, he did not find too much from it. Something worth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucian answered, Fernando faded out of his seriousness, revealing a shameless smile: "Speak up, thank you, if you are involved in this It is a matter of how the god of silver moon and the mysterious existence may both fall and fall. As long as we find the unknown space that they finally smashed into, we have no small hope to harvest some 'precious materials before they recover. ', enriching the most valuable 'information' for almost blank research directions. Lucien, you are really the lucky star of the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, each The high-level Arcans are research madmen, and the Arcane Masters are typical representatives. Lucien feels that their consciousness is still different from them, and they did not expect this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, when can I find the unknown alien space?" Unconsciously, Lucien's tone brought a bit of research fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the case of a clear understanding of existence and a vague visual impression, it takes about three to ten years to search with astrology."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The parliament will certainly invest a lot of manpower and resources in this respect, because it is not only us who saw the vision at the time, but the strongmen of the Southern Church, the Northern Church, the Dark Council, etc. should have witnessed it. It is a mystery of the legendary peaks. I believe that they will all be crazy. Whoever finds them first can occupy a favorable position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando probably give Lucien Explain, "You don't want to worry about this thing. Your astrology is still too far away! When you find the different space, I will apply to the highest appraisal team, go there to explore, when will you If you like, just follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mercilessly attacked Lucien’s achievements in the magic of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what are you doing in a hurry?" Fernando asked after a little doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thinks about his own purpose, with a smile in his smile: "Teacher, I want to use your half-plane to jump once and go to the tile." "The Principality of Orit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not just coming back?" Fernando has always been conceited, but now he does not understand his students' thinking logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly explained: "This time I asked a friend to help lead Prince Dracula, although she has used astrology to determine her safety, but It’s better to meet up and talk. After all, Prince Dracula has a strong strength in cursing and nightmares.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She? The girl of Hathaway’s family "Fernando knows that Lucien and Natasha have a good relationship, so they nod their heads. "Do you need me to pick you up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Lucy En suddenly had an illusion of being picked up by the parents, and it was inexplicably funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fernando got up and was ready to take Lucien to his half-plane, Lucien noticed that Aphrodite was "learning" with dedication. I was completely distracted and greeted myself. I immediately curiously asked: "Affris, what are you studying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alchemy, Golem Production. "Affris did not raise his head." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
