			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Habero did not think that the attack would come so suddenly, there was no sign beforehand, I thought it was just a "dinner feast" before the unobtrusive The episode, it takes a few minutes to recover the physical condition, but Lucien is so decisive and so quick to kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he never know two words to consider and hesitate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the silver cup that the Habero Baron is about to fill is directly hit by two silver-black magic missiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright red liquid splashes everywhere, and the broken silver cup with a quirky symbol falls on the floor covered with thick blankets, making a dull sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Baron Habero and Karin, who are slow-moving and slow-moving, look at this scene with a stunned look, and have not understood what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucine roll over the ground, this opportunity, the left hand index finger ice blue light flashes, three crystal ice flying blade to Kazakhstan Bello hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien is still in the state of mental instability in the caster buffer, but the magic items can still be done until this time, Baron Habero Only then reacted, roared, his right hand clenched his fist to "Palmera's ice flying blade", and his left hand retracted before the head and neck. His hands and face glowed with cold gray light, like hard rock, squeaking, crisp and broken sound, and a cold flying blade was broken by Habero’s right boxing, but his gray stone fist There was also a deep cut, and a layer of glittering frost spread rapidly along the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two ice-blade blades, squatting on the left arm of Baron Habero, hit one of his legs, though Did not reinvent the body after his petrification, but the ice layer that can be raised is to temporarily freeze him in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming curse sounded, and a black ray of death smelled from Kaline to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned out to be a magic apprentice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful star-shaped shield suddenly emerges around Lucien, and the Necromancer rays only darken the small pieces of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician built a spell model in the soul can be instant! And Lucien has also passed the spelling of the cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice layer of Habero’s body was quickly dyed in a grayish white color and then completely cracked like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get rid of the frozen, he gave up the idea of ​​turning to take the long sword on the desk after a slight trade-off, and directly rushed to Lucien, who must marry the magic The teacher is still in the opportunity to cast a buffer, otherwise the next magic may produce any bad results! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right fist hits the "Starlight Shield" of Lucien with a grayish white petrified mist, letting it begin to petrify and crack, and at the same time with the magician The combat experience of Habero changed direction with the strength and speed of the second-level knight and continued to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blocking of the star shield, the spell model in the soul of Lucien is inspired, with his own heart, a peaceful green ripple spreads rapidly around the circumference without difference. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelene, who was about to continue to use magic, was touched by the peaceful green ripples, and his eyes became blind. Her mouth opened and made a big yawn, soft to sleep on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic "sleeping"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the powerful body of Baron Habero is covered by a range of attacks, it feels a deep exhaustion, just as when he is old The weakness, so there was a brief pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this pause, Lucien’s left hand blazed a blazing fire, and the head-sized fireball flew to Habero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habero instantly got rid of the effects of sleep, and he could face the fireball that came from the attack. He could only rush to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of pale yellow mixed dark red stinking liquid oozes from the gray rock body, Habero's face is visible to the naked eye, and he madly screams and slams the road to Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien’s own spells and magic items are still in the buffer, guarding the sword, blocking Habero’s fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little gray fog began to wreak havoc and seemed to be petrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien didn’t have a slap in the face of the first wave of attacks, and a brilliant and solemn light fell from the sky on Habero. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Light?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray stone skin faded in the burning of the Holy Light Habero had a shocking wrinkle, and the flesh was a little bit rotten. His expression was terrified and full of understanding, like a prisoner who had been waiting for a long time and finally faced trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of "lost youth" is quickly lost, falling to the ground in flames and holy light, and can no longer stand up, telling like a nightmare: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My skin slowly lost its brilliance, like a dried peel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The hateful wrinkles covered my face and covered my body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My strength, my speed, can't be in my sorrow Reversingly weakened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mind started to be dull, the things I saw in my eyes became blurred, and the food I tasted lost my taste. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My body and passion are completely declining, even in the face of a beautiful little girl can't do anything..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habello's eyes are confused and dull looking at Lucien, as if he is confessing to the pastor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do people want Going old?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Why do you lose all your happiness when you are old?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the Lord's Kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Lucian can't understand the pain of aging, but Habero's confused struggle is to make him touch: "Fortunately, I chose the magic path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a high-level, the magician not only has a life expectancy of two hundred years old, but also various methods such as rituals and potions to greatly extend the life, such as the conversion of the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the high-level magician who died from the failure of the conversion ceremony is much more successful than the success. The higher the level of magic, the easier it is to convert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the first- and medium-level magicians have all sorts of weird ways to extend their lives. Although not enough, the life expectancy is two or three. Double is still not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repenting, Baron Habero’s unusually cloudy eyes slowly closed and fell on the carpet, completely losing the breath of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien was slightly fortunate to think: "Fortunately, I rushed in time, or else wait for the Baron Habero to use the magic ceremony to recover. The level of the second peak, the battle may not be so simple. I really want to escape, causing the Baron to be alert. With his own strength, a large number of guards and possible Necromancers, it is very likely that he will die. It’s me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first opportunity, the enemy has only half of the strength, as a formal magician has enough ability to incorporate the rhythm and pace of the battle into himself The control, so Lucien did not feel the difficulty of killing a second-level knight, like a calm experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the baron, Lucian’s bad premonition still exists, and all sorts of doubts come to mind: “The Baron Habero did not Casting Necromancer, who is teaching him to keep his youth with his child's life? Is there another Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand holding the casting material In the ear, listening to the fierce shouting of the other soldier in the castle, Lu Xien woke up with Kailin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
