			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is empty, the ancient and magnificent city of Aalto stands on the banks of the Belém, and the tiger sees the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its walls are different from the blacks that most magicians like, with a dark yellow color, seemingly vicissitudes of countless years, like the eternal starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not dare to fly, but stayed up late, still arrived in the current core city of the empire a few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished his clothes and walked toward the gate, where he guarded more than a dozen magicians, and the leader of the leader unobtrusively sighed, is a ** 师! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at noon, the farmers, vendors, and citizens who entered and exited the city did not have any reduction. They were still bustling, and they felt the prosperity and vitality of Aalto. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" A mid-level magician at the gatekeeper saw Fernando close and waved his hand to stop him. In an extraordinary period, no one wanted to be a night watchman. Sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Fernando is wearing a bright red magic robe, the guardian’s sorcerers’ attention has shifted, except for the sorcerer’s face, the expression is slightly Shen Ning, it seems that there is a slight change, they will unscrupulously shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando voice loudly said: "I am from the Greater Holm area, here to find my good friend Antec, he is the student of the 'King of the Nightmare'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec is just a high-ranking mage who just entered the sixth ring. He wants to be famous, so Fernando directly lifted his teacher to avoid accidents. The legendary magician "King of Nightmare". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of their department, the ultimate occupation is the "King of Nightmare", just like the former Masjilin who ruled the city. His book "The Book of Astrology and Elements" also has only two legendary occupations, "Prophet" and "Elemental Dominator". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get more legendary careers, only make enough credit for the empire before you can enter the Empire Library of Antietre "Learning - In the most prosperous period of the Ilvanas empire, the magicians swelled their confidence. They believed that the legendary powerhouse was the god of the world, and the different professions were the gods of different fields. Therefore, the Imperial Library was named as " The tower of the gods, but the rise of the Church of Truth has made these "spirits" fall into the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of the Nightmare King?" Hearing is a legendary magician. The keeper of the goalkeeper put away a careless attitude. Kindly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando nodded gently: "Yes, but I don't know him, I am only familiar with his student Antec."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't bother to climb the legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird honest guys... The magicians present can't understand Fernando's pride, and take it for granted that he is the kind of research magic that makes himself stupid. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goalkeeper’s teacher smiled and said: “I met with another student of the 'King of the Nightmare’, Stanis, who heard about him from his mouth. Tektronix. So. You go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? In the face of this treatment, Fernando did not adapt, so easily entered? They didn't even ask their names! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ** division will be wrong. I thought that Fernando didn't remember Stanis and didn't dare to believe what he said. So he lowered his voice: "Stannis is the best student of the "King of Nightmare". Should you listen to Antec? He has known the world six months ago. Semi-cured, is considered a quasi-legend, huh, maybe we can see the rare sight, the two 'King of the Nightmare' are in the same city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He already knows that the world is semi-cured?” Fernando had thought that he would soon be the leader of the same generation of “young” magicians. Who knows that Stanis, who is not much older than himself, has already reached this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, maybe this time will try to promote, he is the real genius in the field of illusion dreams." The sorcerer can hardly conceal his envy The nine rings and the legend are only one line apart, but it is the difference between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn't say is that he hopes to talk to Stanislas this time and see if this "real genius" is worthy of his name. He won't praise, swear and look up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goalkeeper’s face looks like a stunner, thinking that the magician who is good at illusion is dedicated to Stanis and the “King of Nightmare”. It is not uncommon to see things, especially he is also familiar with the student Antek, the "King of the Nightmare". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know how to call you?" From Fernando just mentioned "The King of Nightmare", he felt it necessary to know this high-level magician, " I am Nice? Brown, you can call me Nice directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando thinks this is a formal procedure: "I am Fernando? Barista I like others to call me Fernando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This surname seems to be the Arthurian Empire?" Niston paused, hesitantly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando nodded: "Yes, but my teacher is the mage of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice did not confirm further. It seems that Fernando’s words are true. He smiled and said: “Fernando, go ahead, Antec is waiting for you, and we have the opportunity to exchange magic knowledge.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Antek is waiting for me? Just go in? Don't check and verify my identity? Don't be afraid that I have surrendered to the church and become a night watchman?" Fernando felt after he and Douglas knew the problem. It is increasing day by day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on Nice's face is a bit strange: "Reassured, Aalto will not have a night watchman, you see, isn't that Antek?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his fingers, Fernando saw a young man with a monocle. He was thin, his hair was messy, his face was pale, his cheekbones were high, his face was full of Hu slag, exudes a nausea-like taste, as if there has been no meditation room or laboratory for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are as ugly as before." Fernando bluntly attacked Antec. "And still don't know how to pack yourself."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec has a bitter face: "I can't get rid of it anyway, no beautiful female mage will look at me, hey, only you, such a beautiful guy." The value of packing up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hint of envy and envy in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't change your looks yourself?" Fernando didn't have the idea of ​​taking care of Antec's mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec is thinking very seriously: "Our magic tower is not much good at ** transformation, others I don't trust too much. Ugly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, still a coward, dare not try, dare not take risks, always feel that others will do things badly! You should not follow the 'nightmare Wang's study, you should go to the 'Tower of Doom'!" Fernando's mouth was unusually poisonous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tower of Doom is the half-face of the legendary magician of Lord of Doom, and he has fallen to Antiller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec is not so timid in front of friends who have known for many years, slightly intent: "My teacher said, I have a strong talent in the field of dreams, It is best for quietly hiding in a safe and concealed place to manipulate dreams. Manipulating illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. It is suitable for you, a coward." Fernando owes a tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec suddenly smiled: "Fernando, I will tell you a story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well? Tell a story?" Fernando did not keep up with Antec's thinking of jumping. Suddenly he felt that he had not seen it for more than a decade. The friend had more things he couldn't grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec took Fernando through the gates. Walked into the lively market area. The bloody family with a parasol. The elf who embraced the sun, the dragon on the roof, drank the dwarf. The busy people are like this, like the Garden of Nations, the different styles are combined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
