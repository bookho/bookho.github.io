			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of Lucien was to use the piano version of the symphony of destiny to inspire Victor's inspiration, and even let him directly complete the melody, improve the details and then compile the deal. So the surprise that I caused myself is limited to a few people like Victor, Lot, and Rhein. I won't be known by most people, and I will become a freak in their eyes, which will attract the attention of others. After all, learning music is only two. It is impossible to write such a piece of music in less than a month, and it is unique in the history of mainland music that Lucien has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien had no way to evade, without hesitation, promised: "Okay, Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Victor said before, genius does not need a reason, and above this, others are most skeptical that they are plagiarism, do not think about their own magician status, or will themselves Linked to the devil, the demon, etc., because this seems to be the opposite of two things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the large number of religious books in the music library, the music is described as the precious wealth that the god of truth gives to mankind, a weapon that motivates people to advance in difficult times, and I have only heard of magicians, devils, etc., "giving" people powerful power, beautiful voices, and skillful playing skills. They have never directly written the musical talents of music, especially this music is also exciting. The positive energy of fighting with difficulties and fighting with the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucian from this period of reading of travel notes, religious books, etc., and with Lott, Felice, Herodotus It is faintly aware that the church and the nobility have a layer of separation. Although Lott is still pious and full of awe in the god of truth, in casual words, there will often be something like "religious things return to God, noble things to the king" Meaning, this is true in the powerful Aalto, what about other countries? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien judged that the church could not see a person with status to perform a magical examination without evidence, especially the Musicians Association and The nobility and the church are closely related. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing to worry about is that when you are invited to perform and attend a banquet, if you encounter an important person, you will inevitably be checked to prevent the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you have been a very famous, very famous, and very famous musician before then, the inspections you encounter will definitely become The surface is lax and easy to handle. Of course, if the important characters themselves are very powerful, the inspection will be very simple, not even. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein picked up the quill and a stack of white paper from the desk and walked to the front of the piano and handed it to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the white paper on the music stand, Lucien picked up the feather pen and just started to sneeze, suddenly hit several sneezes, and the weak body felt a burst of coolness. I couldn't help but tremble, and the rain on my hair sputtered onto the white paper with the sneezing motion, and a little halo was rendered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor noticed the condition of Lucien, and his body was soaked: "Lu Xien, you didn't have an umbrella?" Felice blushes slightly. Because Lucien's linen blouse is tightly attached to the body, revealing the slim but fit figure he has trained in recent months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hit, but the rain is very big outside, I ran over again." Lucien did not say that he was running directly from the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor looked gratified and moved: "Lu Xien, I have several sets of clothes in the lounge, you are similar to my height, go and change it, It seems that you have to be sick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead, Lucien, give me the things I wrote, I can try if I can Completely restored." Rhein also urged Lucian, took the quill from his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this action, Lucien had a brief contact with Rhein’s fingers, and it was slightly strange to find that Rhein’s body temperature was even worse than his own soaked guy. Cold, it seems that the body is a little special? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another room in the lounge, Lucien wiped his hair and body Dry, replaced with Victor's white shirt, black dress jacket, black stovepipe pants and leather shoes, suddenly have a dry and refreshing feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien opened the door of the room and walked out. The Rhine, which was recording the music, was immersed in the music. There was no reaction, and Victor turned around and looked at Lucien from head to toe. He nodded with satisfaction: "Yes, It’s a pretty boy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a road, there is still a little bit of suspicion in Felix, Lott and Herodotus. disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use appearance to judge that people are not the privilege of the people of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, come over and see if Mr. Rhein wrote the music in front of him." Victor greeted Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was in the past when Lott passed by, Lott used a very noble, very standard, very ceremonial smile, whispered: "Lu Xien, I hope I can discuss music with you often in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Lucien answered the same politely,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis heard the conversation between the two, the white teeth biting the rich lips, and whispering with a faint blush: "Lu Xien, I apologize to you for the previous prejudice, I hope I can get along with you in the future and discuss music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien’s performances and touching music that he refused to give up today are deeply shaken. Felice's heart, but not yet to the extent that she likes it, the blush on her face is more of a shy and hesitant mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Herodotus stood on the other side in a complex mood, his head was low, he looked at his toes and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After accepting the apology of Felice, Lucien went to the piano and discussed the issue of music with Rhein and Victor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 3 pm, Felice passed through a lot smaller The rain curtain, from the window, saw the coach of the Othello Baron into the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor gestured to Lucien to organize the stack of music, and said very pleasantly: "In fact, you didn't write the part of the melody, just now you The emotional performance has almost been shown, so I can add most of it so quickly. It seems that music really needs emotional resonance, and piety and gratitude are one of them, so there are religious themes, always It is more touching than a music that expresses music beautifully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, although some of the music is not perfect, it is only a few details. I can get the registration of the association first. As for the director of Othello, I think he can't resist such a great piece of music. I believe that the Royal Highness will not mind changing the track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s play just in an angry and unwilling mood, broke out the emotions that he has been suppressing all the time, the thoughts of his loved ones, the pain of losing everything in the past, the encounter Species Frustration and difficult struggles, as well as the thoughts of not wanting to give up, not giving up, are all incorporated into the piano playing. If that part of the deliberately imperfect melody itself has not been practiced, I am afraid that Lucien will play with a hearty voice. Come out, even then, many melody is naturally produced by the men, they are not fine enough, not perfect, but enough to give Victor the inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Victor, Lucien followed him to a room on the third floor, sitting inside an old gentleman with glasses and white hair, he Looked at Victor and Lucien with pale gray eyes, plainly: "Victor, have you finished your symphony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joseph, not me It’s my student Lucien, who wrote an excellent work, and I took him to register.” After answering Victor, he said to Lucien: “This is Mr. Joseph, a senior. Music critic, who has heard most of the music, including the fairy music, is also a trainee pastor, he will initially identify whether your music is plagiarized, and then use the power of the Lord to leave a mark of time on it, later in this Similar melody that appears after time will be considered as copying your work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph looked at Lucien very strange and wondered: "How long does it take you to study music?" Can you write your work so quickly, the talent is very good? Good too. "Then he took the sheet music, pushed his glasses, seriously again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
