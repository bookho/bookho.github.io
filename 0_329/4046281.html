At the time of the singer, it was difficult to conceal the shock. If he had heard the footsteps before, he entered the spell-casting concentration, and he was always good at keeping calm. Now he has withdrawn from the invisible state because of the violent fluctuations in his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ural City is as big as Allinge, and its wilderness in the west is more sparsely populated, the mountains are continuous, and the two are attentive to avoid each other. People who flee in different directions can meet at the bottom of such a narrow and dark mine. What an incredible idea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it happening? Or is he actually following me secretly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien strives to make His heartbeat, breathing, etc. are gentle, not to break through the natural concealment brought by invisibility, while converging any thoughts of killing Ivanovsky, he is a big knight, the intuition of danger is amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road hiding in the shelter, Lucian calmly watched Ivanovsky stop and looked around the bottom of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it’s completely unpredictable to meet other people in such a remote and abandoned place, or perhaps for other reasons, Ivanovsky is not completely The ground has carefully searched the bottom of the mine. After sweeping with a keen eye and intuition, he sighed softly and seemed to relax a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Ivanovsky turned and walked to the bracket near the gap in the Necromancer, kneeling down on one knee and drawing a cross on his chest. Pray in a low voice: "The Father is on, please come and live in us, wash away all our filth, save our soul..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He must pray at this time?" Lu Xien thought with a little doubt, the big smuggler, the "sinister" who was a hot, rude and direct, the "big acting" knight, actually Devoted to the "pure good" believers of the God of truth? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the knowledgeable and knowledgeable "scholar" Lucian immediately awakened: "No, whether it is the Northern Church or the Southern Church, it is called the truth." God is either the Lord, or the true God and the supreme being, never calling the Father, and the orthodox cross is obviously long and short, not as short as Ivanovsky painted the cross. Long, ugly but with a quirky taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a believer in other gods? No, from the Arcane Library, all can give God The book "Real God" can be known that in order to avoid the influence of the truth, there is no 'God' church that uses the cross as a sign..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What forces are hidden behind Ivanovsky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are getting more and more different, Lucien is trying to suppress his own thinking, not to be Too active to be perceived by Ivanovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of Ivanovsky’s short prayer, the solemn and sacred spirit of the sacred atmosphere appeared in front of him, and a little white light slowly lit up, and What makes Lucien very surprised is that this sacred breath is the true breath of truth, not the magic of natural deity or other gods. The magical techniques cast by different church priests are the same in common deity. But the subtleties still reflect their different characteristics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can use special magic, is he a paladin?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread out, Ivanowski's eyes were drilled, and then he smiled and extended his right hand, and inserted the crack in the dead spirit accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Earl Witt goes after the killing, first hide in it, thank God the Father for providing such a hidden world that overlaps with the main world, who?!" Ivanovsky quickly talked to himself with a relaxed sentence, and then his face changed greatly. His left hand slammed the giant sword and slammed into the corner of Lucien. The right hand quickly recovered and held the handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing him put his right hand into the crack of the Necromancer and heard his thanks to the words of the Father, Lucien’s heart was filled with turbulent waves, what is this? What happened? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Lucien is so good at controlling emotions and staying calm, when he witnesses such subversive things, it is inevitable that he will lose control and the emotional changes will be The keen sense of the Grand Knight of Wannovsky is sensed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A circle of blue and quiet water curtain light is centered on the body of Lu Xien, and spreads rapidly in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Rings Magic "Strong Sleep", this is another new magic that Lucien built in the soul in the months of entering the Shahran Empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best choice to use Ignatius to entangle Ivanovsky at this time, but this second ring magic is currently associated with the Maskillin star. The same kind of magic is the special kind, even if the soul model is built in the soul, it needs to cooperate with the material, and the time is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky is very fast, but strong sleep is a range-type wave attack, and does not give him a chance to go away, but he When the great swords of both hands slammed into the aura of intense sleep, a white glare appeared on the body, and the blue water curtain was split directly after being shaken vigorously, just like the sea was separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little splash "blue light" spread to Ivanovsky, but he just recovered his lucidity with a slight confusion, without delaying the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not expect the effect of intense sleep to be so Poor, just stagnant Ivanovsky's slightly invisible time, basically did not delay his speed to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big change is almost a difference between life and death. Fortunately, Lucien has a backhand, a spirit, and the "element" ring is excited, and the golden flame emerges out of thin air. Outside the evening gown, it forms a magical flame shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky shines the white light of the great sword and smashes the golden flame shield, which sparks countless sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame shield swayed violently, and there seemed to be signs of disintegration, and Ivanowski was snorted and re-rolled by the flame, burning A piece of black is out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strong Flame Shield" not only protects against physics, elements, explosions, and pure energy attacks, but also creates a severe flame bounce for enemies in close range attacks. The damage is the magic that can stand and keep attacking the enemy and can kill him. Only a lot of encounters by Lucien are death, curse, soul and other strange attacks. This five-ring magic has not played its true power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, how many powerful magic items does this guy have?!" Ivanovsky also found that he was spying on Lucien, but let him Surprisingly, it uses a five-ring magic, also inspired by magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky is very annoyed and angry. If it is all the defensive magic of the three rings or most of the defensive magic of the four rings, I have no confidence. The sword "opens" the defense and kills Lucien, but the powerful magic items on his body are too much, right? This is simply a luxury! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a great knight, Ivanovsky has a strong will, no immersion in the annoyance, no pain in the damage caused by the flame shield. After carrying a layer of milky white light to calm down the burning flame, quickly shift the position, avoid locking, and then continue to fight with the wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every time the Great Sword hits, the five-ring "Strong Flame Shield" is shaken abnormally and seems to have been structurally damaged, along with In Ivanovsky's embarrassment, the air around Lucian oscillated, making his soul and mental strength difficult to stabilize, seriously disturbing Lucien's follow-up spelling, prolonging his spelling time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is 'interfering' blood? Another pure wizard hunter blood!" Lucien as a magician, knowledgeable is a must, because only In this way, in the race against time, the ability of the other party can be judged at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interfering" bloody strokes have the effect of dispelling magic, and as long as they hit, they can seriously interfere with the magician's spellcasting, and it can also interfere with magic. It works, so the resistance to magic is very strong, it is one of the true magician's blood, and it is more powerful with the help of the Paladin. For example, Ivanovsky has the ability to extinguish the rebound of the flame shield. It is the combination of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivanovsky’s strength is five levels, but his speed, agility, etc. are not four, and there should be strength. The items of the Paladin, which are 'interfering' with blood, are very demanding on magical and magical items. They cannot use talisman, necklaces, rings, etc., and can only wear large items such as armor, boots, gloves, etc. , complex anti-interference array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While holding the "Amora Staff" in the left hand, and using it to condense the effect of mental power, Lucien plays the potential of his soul. The experience of breaking free from the influence of the six-ring magic "sluggishness" seems to have caused a small change in the soul of Lucien. At this time, Ivanovsky’s constant slamming interference is actually faster than expected. Get rid of the spelling buffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky slammed with the normal hunter hunter tactics, although the body burned everywhere, but not fatal, and powerful flame shield It has reached the edge of the broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was really broken, Ivanovsky believed that he could quickly kill Lucien, who was seriously disturbed by the spell. Suddenly, he had an extremely dangerous instinct and decisively gave up the attack on Lucien, and he turned without hesitation and left, rushing toward the gap of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, a group of deep yellow-green gas emerges from the bottom of the mine, solidifying like amber, beautiful but extremely dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a little bit contaminated, Ivanovsky feels his head dizzy, his body is soft, but he has no fear, the combination of magic and interference power Exploding suddenly, emptying nearby, obscuring sight and mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Ivanovsky entered the gap between the dead spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times can this guy use five-ring magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately there is The channel given by the Father, except for those who are taken care of by the Father, cannot be detected and entered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drilling into the realm of the dead, all colors faded, only Heavy black, sad, monotonous white, lonely gray, and always silent and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky’s head with dizzy head fainted on the ground, driving the blood to fight the damage caused by the poisonous mist, a drop of pus Out, vitality began to recover quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky in a safe environment is about to be thankful, suddenly his head is completely dizzy, like acupuncture pain. This sudden attack made Ivanovsky's interference bloody less effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charming Humans (Knight Edition)! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivanovsky’s eyes were astonished to see Lucien appearing in the realm of the dead, clasping his sword with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did he come in? How did he know this?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious dizziness Wannowski was unable to act, and was smashed by Lucian in a place where the armor was corroded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the sound, the armor has not been destroyed, but Ivanovsky feels that his mind and body have become sluggish, with the influence of the previous magic Every move is like slow motion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frost", a long sword that can slow down enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two consecutive swords, Lucien jumped back and his right hand pointed, and Ivanovs’s basically eroded helmet collapsed into countless black and white. Gray light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Elemental Order" lifted Ivanovsky defense, Lucien inspired the bracelet of the weaver, and the skull-sized fireball flew to Ivan Nevsky's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ivanovsky looked at the fireball and succumbed to it, but it was too slow to escape and was directly blown into the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent explosion occurred, and when the smoke subsided, there were countless wounds on Ivanovsky’s head, and the black-and-white ash liquid flowed around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the defensive power of his Cavaliers level made him not die, but instead got rid of the slow effect and the speed recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that Ivanovsky’s head is a mess, it’s hard to make effective judgments, just subconsciously speed up and avoid being locked by magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
