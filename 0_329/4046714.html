			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, Fernando in the study heard a gentle knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So early?" Fernando looked at Lucien with a slightly muddy red eye, and suddenly there was a subconscious vigilance and alert to his anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and smiled: "When the paper is finished, the sun rises, so I came straight."<br /><br />&nbsp "What paper?" Fernando has a more dangerous premonition. This is not from the main star of destiny, but the "wisdom of wisdom" that has repeatedly condensed in the same situation. "Is there a subversion?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment and definitely nodded: "Yes, but only from the observation of a large number of experimental results, there is no strict proof, and it is not excluded that these observations will be included in the future. Other theories of the phenomenon** or cover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it." Fernando breathed a sigh of relief, so that before the arguments for determining the surname were proved, The theory of subversion can't make himself burst his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien took out a paper and handed it over. Fernando looked at the subject and his expression was not good at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Probability Interpretation of Wave Functions." He read the title of the paper one word at a time, faintly guessing what was inside, this paragraph Since time, a lot of experiments he has done on electron scattering and diffraction seem to indicate what it is. The reality that Oliver's interpretation of the wave function cannot match some experimental results seems to explain what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the paper, Fernando read without a word, the surrounding atmosphere is getting more and more depressed, like a real storm is about to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he looked up after he had finished reading the paper, and there were countless electric lights flashing in his red eyes, which was extremely dangerous: "You mean that the wave function is not normal." The wave on the wave, but the probability wave?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien greeted the teacher’s dangerous eyes without fear: “Yes, through the results of a large number of experiments Observing, by introducing the content of the Chloe statistics in the field of molecular motion, we can describe the wave function, which characterizes the probability that an electron appears somewhere in space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fernando seems to be suppressing great anger: "Then it has a certain position on the receiving screen, the probability is 100%!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Undoubtedly, every arcian has seen the experimental phenomenon that the electrons are emitted onto the sensing screen and ignited the fluorescent dots. Its position is certain and certain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands the teacher’s mood and is very serious: “For example, without knowing the external conditions, we throw coins, throughout the process. We can only say that it has the potential to prove that it is facing up, but when it falls to the ground, the result has been determined and there will be no change. The probability is naturally 100%. We are discussing the electrons before observation, not after observation. The electrons that have been identified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good understanding of Fernando, the mood is slightly relaxed, and the focus is: "Before observation? After observation ? Before we observe, according to your interpretation, electrons may appear in any position in space, but the probability of occurrence in some places is greater?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He can't imagine the existence of electrons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coin, Fernando can accept it without any hindrance, it is positive and negative, and it has different landing possibilities, but the electronic, because of the description It's the probability of spatial location, so it's possible anywhere, isn't that the same moment, it might be here, maybe it's there, it's everywhere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ridiculous and ridiculous than any magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least so far, except for the level of the gods that cannot be known, no magician can create such magic and let himself exist in a similar state! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien made a metaphor: "Before observing, electrons are like a group of illusory clouds without entities. It is permeated in space, everywhere. It is all possible superposition states. The thicker part is where the probability of occurrence is relatively large, but it does not mean that it will appear here after observation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Fernando pressed his lips tightly, as if he had just opened his mouth, it was a roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said further: "In fact, the teacher should observe through the magic experiment. When we improve the magic array and reduce the number of electrons emitted once, It can be seen that the first thing that appears is not the diffraction image, but the disordered electronic induction spot. As the number of electrons increases, it gradually forms a diffraction image. Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is because, after a single electron diffraction, it is impossible to know exactly what it is. It is probability. We can only describe that it appears more likely here, so a small amount of electrons will be in a state of disorder, but the number is sufficient. After much, the whole is in line with the probability distribution. In some places, there are many electrons, and some places have fewer electrons, so the light and dark are mixed, and the diffraction image appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like throwing seven or eight coins, we can't accurately guess that the coin is facing up several times, but when the number of coin toss reaches several hundred, thousands, and tens of thousands, the number of positives should be about half. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can improve the magic array one day and only launch one electron at a time, then things will be more clear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probability, Probability!" Fernando's expression was a bit distorted, just like eating the probability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not need Lucien to explain the common sense of probability to himself. This is one of the areas where he is the clearest and best at the thermodynamic authority. At this time, his mind emerges. The electron diffraction experiment that has been done since this time is indeed as Lu Xien said. Before the number of electrons is not enough, the light spot is disorderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clear picture made his hands tremble slightly, and the surrounding wind blew up and blew the paper in the study: "Before observing, the electrons were The probability cloud that permeates the space? After observation, is it a substance with a certain position? What happened in the middle?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned a blind eye to the wind, Calm is like the death of the verdict: "The wave function is curled up, and the diffuse probability cloud collapses into a small point that determines the position. Observing causes the wave function to collapse. Before observing, what form the electron is, has nothing to do with us. It doesn't make sense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does the observation cause the wave function to collapse?" Hey, a lightning bolt illuminates the study and destroys a statue. Fernando stands up suddenly. Looking at Lucien, "Our observation, let the electronics change its form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "Teacher, we observe What is the means based on? Seeing things, is For the reflected light, the sound is heard because of the corrugation of the air, and in the microscopic field, even the slightest observation means, such as photons, can also disturb the electrons. That is, our observation of the microscopic particles is inevitable. Will cause it to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The interaction of microscopic particles?" Fernando's face is slightly better, probably understanding why the observation causes the wave function to collapse, as for Before the probabilistic cloud, something that could not be understood and unimaginable, he decided to ignore it for a while, pointing to the core of Lussian's probability interpretation. "The activity of tossing a coin can be strictly known about each time by knowing various external conditions. Therefore, it is not a true probability, it is a pseudo-probability, and it has a cause. All initial states strictly and uniquely determine the final result. This is the basis of the astrology system and the basis of the whole arcane and magic!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The probabilities of electronic representations are also pseudo-probabilities, which are influenced by external conditions that we have not yet discovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is a little trembling, and there are more and more signs of storms in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head firmly: "At least there is no indication that there are external conditions. We can only say that the probability wave is electronic." The essence belongs to the surname, the surname of the guilty name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say it again!" Fernando finally roared, lightning and thunder began to appear, and it was made in the study. Like a last scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why arcane and magic are fascinating, exploring the realities of the world, let generations of magicians and arcaneists pay their youth, talent and life because they I believe that the world has an essential law. Everything works strictly under the control of this law. For example, the sun rises and falls, such as the celestial body, such as wind and rain, such as biological growth, such as elemental reactions, such as material mystery. For example, atomic structure, and as long as you understand the laws of nature, you can master them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
