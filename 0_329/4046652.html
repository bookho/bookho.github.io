			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mathematics reveals everything, but in the end it still falls on the specific meaning of the Arcane. We need to know through mathematics how this process is, why is it like this, According to similar laws, we can draw results, rather than simply discussing mathematics. This is the purpose of our exploration of the world and the search for truth.” Fernando first affirmed Lucien’s ideas and expressed his opinions. "For example, in your Evans geometry, before becoming a space-time model of general relativity, few people except the tower's arcane masters will study it carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien has a similar view on this issue: "Yes, mathematics is our best tool, we rely on it to replace our imagination, but no matter what, we need an interpretation of the new alchemy, Our interpretation of the internal structure of the atom and the meaning of the quantum mechanics of arcane can be boldly assumed, but it must be carefully confirmed, so I can't give an answer for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs P;&nbsp; Fernando nodded lightly: "Since your mathematical method can solve the problem successfully, it must contain something you haven't found yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, he frowned and complained a little bit: "At last, I don't have to be disturbed by the problems of new alchemy, such as the imposed quantization conditions. They are like 10,000 flies flying, making me want to destroy the world. I can quietly continue to study the rules of electronic arrangement. There are still many things after the principle of incompatibility and the principle of energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no export praise Lucian's research, but this attitude also shows his inner happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not think so, when you are arguing with others about these problems, but the red light is full of joy and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Combine your paper, elementary and alchemists in the field of alchemy are eagerly awaiting its emergence." Fernando couldn't help but mention it. In a word, "In fact, you can use the previous math tools to look more friendly, rather than let them learn a math first. Although it is the most basic math, if you are not my student, I will put your thesis. Tear off in front and let you rewrite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, your student is the one who is most snarled by you, Lucien swears, then smiles "I walked through the path of building mathematical tools in the process of research. Later I remembered that there were some similar things in the original arcane system, but since I have already made it, simply submit it together, this paper is Two in one, great value experience, and the end of the wedding, I will start to use the original mathematical tools to transform it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lucien like to invent all kinds of strange words Habit, Fernando has adapted very well: Give it to your students to finish it. You hang a name, there is no need to waste time on it, and give them the opportunity to exercise. Right, how the 'wedding' is going, it is very important." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded: "Only the refinement of exclusive legendary items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Normally, refining a legendary item takes a week if everything is ready. If refining is not successful, time is too late. You remember to borrow the 'thorn crown'." Fernando reminded that this time can not blame the Arcane point, and if the refining is successful, because it is a unique legendary item, the power will be larger than normal, but also the "thorn crown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will borrow if the refining is successful." Although Lucien is a bit greedy, he still has to spend money when he spends money, and he still has to pay. Consider the safety of Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to hurry and study, your paper has rekindled my enthusiasm." Fernando finally praised Lucien in a slight way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher, you have always been passionate and motivated, every member of the highest jury can testify, every arcane master who is roaring by you can As a testimony, Lucien published a copy of the paper and left the study with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando’s right hand pressed his forehead and said suspiciously: “The momentum multiplier is not equal to the positional multiplier. What does this mean in the end?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the retransmission of alchemy life, Lucien’s paper soon came to pull Wendi and Gaston are on the hands of two members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pragmatic faction of the high-level Arcanists who only carefully considers the results of the experiment, he has initially accepted the idea of ​​Lucien, treating electrons as a substance that has not yet been understood, rather than particles or waves in the original concept. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s just preliminary acceptance, all the experimental results of the past, the clear track image, let him contradict the concept of electronic waves, no I believe that it can solve the problem completely, and I feel that the new alchemy has reached a point where it is a matter of life and death. It seems that it will be destroyed at any time and declare the mistakes of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this subconscious repression, his research progress is very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracting the thickest stack of papers, Lavin’s dark gray pupil suddenly solidified: “On Quantum Mechanics? Lu Xien? Evans? X ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the problem of the title, Lavin did not directly relate it to the new alchemy, but thought that Lucien was studying the field of force and relativity The field: "Quantum mechanics, the relativity of quantum processing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter what the paper, Lucian’s research is always worth learning, Lavin I opened the cover and read it carefully. The starting matrix made him very uncomfortable. It wasn't how difficult it was. He was used to the similar mathematical tools in the past. He couldn't help but confuse. The pale gray eyebrows couldn't help. Wrinkled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beginning of the official content of the paper, Lavin’s eyebrows stretched out and replaced with a thoughtful look. The matrix is ​​not strange, but Lucien The ideas embodied in this paper are quite amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at him, he held the paper hands, the blue veins gradually revealed, and the expression was a little hollow, because all the spirits were concentrated in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he put down the paper, picked up the quill, and followed the content of the paper and calculated it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White feathers keep shaking, time flies, Lavin does not remember how long he has watched, only knows that his heart is tidal and difficult to restrain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A row of complicated operations is written out, one by one, and the moon rises outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantitative conditions and empirical formulas are naturally derived through arithmetic, and the results are also perfectly matched with experimental data, slamming, Laven's feather pen from Interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed back, leaning against the back of the chair, his eyes tightly closed, his face full of excitement and satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he opened his eyes and found that the afternoon sun was glaring and bright, like his own mood, so he picked up a quill again and gave Morris wrote a letter:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I was still sighing at the beginning of the month that the new alchemy has reached the most critical and the most successful and the darkest and most dangerous moment, 徘徊I couldn't find a way out, I had to compromise on a hypothesis without actual evidence. Who knows, I saw the darkness disperse at the end of the month, and the throne of the Arcane appeared in front of me, so magnificent that people could not move their eyes and lead us to wear It’s the most precious tool of mathematics, which is the most precious tool of mathematics. As he once said, when we explore in the unknown field, we can only rely on mathematical tools, like the lighthouse on the route. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter containing his excitement was sent to the magic tower of Morris by "the mess" along with the rubbish of the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris was enjoying his dinner when he received the letter, and he was full of praise for the seven-cooked mignon, and opened Lavindi freely. letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After aiming a few eyes, his expression suddenly stiffened, jingling, the knife and fork all fell on the plate, then a flash, transferred to the study, Start concentrating and frantically reading, calculating, and thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serving his servant and stunned at this scene, Lord Morris never wastes food, he has always been very economical, very embarrassed, what happened today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day, Morris was freed from the complicated verification, his face was uncontrollable joy, and there was no image activity. He whispered: "When I figure out the meaning of the Arcane in the theory of Lucien, I can recognize that the world is semi-cured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
