			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the little boy Hawke is drinking the refrigerated sky blue, and after hearing the answer from Lucien, he squirted out very politely, Viscount Turner and The expressions of several nobles became solemn, and they looked at Lucien with suspiciousness and exchanged their eyes with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly smiled subconsciously and wanted to say "I am also Lucy Evans," but it seems to flash between the eyes of the electric light. What made her mouth open, how can I not say this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never seen Lucien? Lord Evans and his portrait, but the aristocrats of the pro-magic parliament have long spread the appearance of the great arcane master throughout the aristocracy: black-haired black, medium-sized, handsome, graceful, gentle and restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are no 10,000 young men in this description, there are also 8,000. It is not a bit strange when Karin sees Lucien, but when he self-reports his name After that, the description and the real person seem to correspond, the same black hair, the same black eyes, the same handsome Sven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands twisted together, Karin’s voice trembled and asked: “Is it the order of the elements?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lucien’s becoming a legendary thing is still in a state of secrecy, and the occupation name of “Atom Control” has not yet been known. Therefore, after thinking about Kailin, she uses the nickname “Elemental Order” to ask, just like “magic voters”. "Douglas's nickname is the "Arcane Emperor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think no one should pretend to be me." Lucien smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Hawke couldn’t care for his mouth, his eyes staring at Lucien, letting Lucien remember the little crystal. Fres's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded with a smile, but did not do anything to confirm that he would not disguise his identity because of other people’s compliments, nor would he Questioning and showing out what kind of tokens, what magic to use to prove identity, frank, willing to believe, believe, do not believe, do not believe, anyway, will not have any impact on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly has doubts, but her father, Visa, has a smile and smiles: "Hello, you are the truth of the element, the scepter of time and space, Praise you for the great changes that have brought us to life. We used to be like barbarians in the west of the Shahran Empire. Now we understand what civilization is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really the order of the elements? Karin asked her father with her eyes. She remembered that her father had never seen Lord Evans, otherwise he just recognized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turner quietly nodded to her daughter. Compared to Hawke and Karin, these old aristocrats can associate more things, not only with looks. Description, as well as the origin of the order of the elements, he comes from Aalto, one of the most splendid stars in the history of music, is a poor man, is the lover of Her Majesty, and the Wellesley family is also from Aalto, also a poor Born, I also got the attention of Her Majesty...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so many details hooked together, they naturally confirmed the identity of Lucien, and he has seen Lucy The two dream rings of the right hand are rumored to be the "Holm Crown" in the rumor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just promoted this process. In fact, with the development of arcane, such social changes will inevitably occur." Lucien added One sentence, especially the parliament needs to fight against the church, but also the support of the nobility and the general public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Hawke got the confirmation of the adults, violently excited, scratching his head, but did not know how to express his feelings, and finally in the eyes of Kailin Under the direction, he rushed to the mahogany coffee table in the small living room, picked up the pen and paper placed on the lower floor, and looked up at Lucien: "Hello, can you sign me a name? I want to look at it and motivate myself. Learning Magic!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent decades, with a great opera that has deeply influenced the people of the Holm Kingdom, they have outstanding singers and like characters. The chase has gradually increased. I don’t know when it started, there have been moves to send flowers and ask for signatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the scene with a funny smile, took the pen and paper and wrote a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While writing, Lucien’s heart groaned, and there was a limited name for the era. If you simplified the magic circle, you made a magic camera and even The camera function is integrated into the mobile communication item, then Hawk should not simply sign, but "Hello, can you take a photo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two rows of fancy words on the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that Little Hawk will study hard and go up every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"--Lu Xien? Evans"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃? Both Hawke and Karin stunned and thought that the grammar and sentence were a bit strange, but they were immediately covered up by happy emotions, like the most precious treasures in the world, carefully folded and carefully folded into pockets. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle of Turner is excited, but on the surface he smiles calmly: "From a few years ago, Hawke always wanted to learn magic, but that The radical sects are still there. We, the middle and small aristocrats, dare not cross the line. Now, finally, I can send him to Aringe in a bright and honest way. Lord Evans, I don’t know which magic school to choose?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that there is no inheritance right when you become a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Hawke was even more excited. He looked at his bright eyes and looked at his father Stevens. Baron Hawke, after receiving a positive response, was as happy as inflammatory disease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien simply said: "This depends on which magical areas of Hawke's ideals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Elements! Alchemy!" Hawke smashed the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Douglas Magic School and Aalborg Magic School are all available." Lucien was a teacher at the School of Magic, and he still knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kailing took the courage and asked: "His Evans, I, is it too late to learn magic now? It’s already adult...if you want Learning medical magic, which school should I go to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there is perseverance, there is basic talent, when is not too late. Medical magic belongs to the dead Department, and need to understand the structure of the human body, inevitably have to deal with the body, you have to think about it, the Aringe School of Magic is better at this aspect." Lucien frankly, then asked a little curiously, "Before listening When you talk about alchemy items, you seem to know more about it and like it. Don't know what kind of products you still want? Just talk, don't be afraid, I just seek more inspiration."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to fly, alchemy items that ordinary people can fly!" Hawke is very envious of the magician and the day knight who can fly, and is also very yearning for the airship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, airplane, or bamboo cat of the robot cat? Lucien smiled and looked at other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai Lin heard that she had to deal with the body, because she was prepared, she did not scare her face, but looked at her mother with concern, deliberately deepening The exchange of alchemy items: "I hope that the magic phonograph can be popularized, and I hope that there will be image-like magic items like it, so that we can enjoy the opera at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Turner smiled and said: "Our most hope is the popularity of alchemicals that can prolong life, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes this is difficult to simplify Got it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic steam train is not universal enough, 90% of the cities are still not connected, and the city is not similar to the town, the country, and the city. Alchemy items can be replaced, our nobles can use carriages, but the burden on ordinary people is relatively large.” Baron Stevens heard that Evans is more concerned about ordinary people and deliberately put forward opinions in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exchange, the rapid footsteps came, Eliza appeared at the door, and the eyes were still red and authentic: "Little Evans, Little John is back. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she called, the rotating staff said that John had already returned, so after telling Joel, she went to the door and waited in a panic, but it was useless. In a few minutes, John rode home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice appeared behind John, wearing silver-white full-length armor, he looked quite burly, after seeing Lucian, he stepped forward With an excited smile on his face, he raised his right hand and clenched his fist. He seemed to want to say hello to the shoulders of Lucien. He just made half of the action, he became sluggish and his expression was quite stiff. It seems that the change of identity, the relationship between the magician and the knight, the strangeness of a few years, makes him a bit cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't seen you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled from the bottom of his heart, stretched his right fist, and gave Lucien a shoulder:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good to come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t say much, a simple sentence would have been a few years old. Alienation and ablation are clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dance has officially started, Eliza goes out to greet the guests, the road Sean, Joel and John continue to recount in the small living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Evans, let me go to the Musicians Association, is your recommendation?" Joel's face is ruddy, drunk, and the blond hair has become white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the very happy father, John smiled: "Dad, the dance begins, you drink a bottle of gold rum, this is not enough." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I am happy, Little Evans is finally back!" Joel's tongue thickened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien snorted: "Uncle Joel, I think you are taking the opportunity to drink alcohol. Usually, Eliza must limit your drink." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Evans, you haven't answered my question yet." Joel said about him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "It’s Natasha who thinks that Uncle Joel is at a good level and can give Lennart’s musicians a 'class'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen has a real vision." Joel is proud of his musical level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan?" Lucien suddenly remembered Evan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer smiled and said: "Ai Wen didn't want to participate in the dance, and went to the manor outside the city with a few noble companions. Hey, he can't always stimulate the blood. Recently, I am interested in alchemy items. I don’t know if I can learn magic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Send Avon to Douglas Magic School to try it out, let me talk to them. Speaking of this, Lucien added, "I don't have much time to be a teacher. The method of teaching students tends to be simple and rude. If there is no solid foundation, I can't adapt."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, so I just want to send Avon to the magic school." John understood the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel looked at John: "I care about yourself before I care about Ai Wen. You are a year older than Little Evans. Go to the dance." I will accompany Little Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John, who has always calmly calmed down, can’t help but feel reddish at the moment, not knowing how to react in the seat. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw it, deliberately helped him to resolve the embarrassing atmosphere, and handed out a key to Joel: "Uncle Joel, this is me." A villa in Line, you can go on holiday when you have time, and go there when you are in danger... This is the address of my magic tower..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel Nodded, no more questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John was urging outside, and finally stood up and said: "Lu Sien, the dance ends and talks again."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead, I am getting married soon, you don't even have a few female friends." Lucien smiled and pointed to the outside with his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer groaned and then smiled: "That will bless you and the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;John followed with a feeling: "The picture of a child seems to be still yesterday, but in a twinkling of an eye, everyone grows up to have their own family, time is really full of feelings, giving everyone a different future... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the memory in Aalto is sometimes very clear, like it just happened, sometimes it is very vague, as if it was already a last life, time Like water, leaving a brand, but dilute the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
