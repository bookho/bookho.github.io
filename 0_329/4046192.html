			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien easily smiled and nodded: "Yes. This unique magic is my own improvement. I think the principle and construction process is very interesting, so I want to Write a paper submission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know arcane?" Eric has a straightforward question. A young man who is just getting in touch with the Arcane can immediately produce research results. He is dead or not, even if the other person is a genius! The development of Arcane to today, without enough knowledge to accumulate, can not open brilliant flowers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are genius, take at least a year to make up the foundation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands Eric’s doubts. No genius on earth can just study mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. for more than a month. The result, with a polite smile, replied: "My unique magical improvement comes from other aspects, not the current arcane knowledge, but I think its construction principle should have some value. Of course, I am exploring for myself. I don't know if there is any duplication with the existing Arcane research results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing the right value and getting some attention to fight against other forces, Lucy I have always understood that I can first go to the Magic Council. I don’t know the extent of the current Arcane research level in the Magic Council. How much knowledge from the Earth can match the different worlds and can be combined with magic. I don’t know, directly related magic. Under the circumstances that the surname of the teacher is not known, it is impossible to blindly and arrogantly publish the results of the arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only understand the current level of the magical parliament, what areas have been studied, and carry out magic experiments to confirm or modify the environment in line with the world. After that, it was the time when Lucien appeared and burst into the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, published research must have pre-knowledge, not in the air, otherwise it will lead people to imagine beyond the "genius." And to be able to use the evidence to quickly end the dispute, or else once involved in the controversy and intrigue, there is not enough strength is the candle in the wind, may be blown out at any time, after all, most arcanes and magicians are angry People with sorrowful emotions, greed, and love for face, not to mention the fact that there are many people who are self-sufficient and narrow-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucian’s answer, Eric’s stiff face was slightly dispelled: “Is it based on the principles of ancient magic construction? Then your research is likely It has been overthrown. If you are not afraid of trouble and disappointment, you can write the paper. Now there is a twenty minute from six o'clock, can you finish it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s perfectly fine. I’ve written the draft in the format of the journal of the Arcane Journal.” Lucien looked at Eric seriously. “Mr. Eric, you haven’t answered my question yet, this paper In addition to submitting to the audit committee, do you need to vote for the journal yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric sees Lucien with a confident look, not very optimistic Give him a parchment and say: "Yes, after your paper has passed the assessment of the 'Arcane Review Board', you will need to vote for different journals. However, since the Parliament strictly prohibits multiple submissions, you must choose Good journal, otherwise it can't be published or the journal is in the field If the power is too low, your paper will only receive the Arcane points rewarded by the Audit Committee and will not be able to obtain the part quoted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for how to choose, Wait until your paper is reviewed." Eric is obviously not willing to waste his saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn't care too much about Eric's attitude, picking up parchment and a quill to write. At this time, Eric pointed to the opposite room: "When you go there to write, I may have a magician here to update the badge data. Remember, give it to me before six o'clock, otherwise you will have to wait until tomorrow." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Bright and light blue room, in the middle is a long table, surrounded by chairs, surrounded by some scenes and sounds of magic Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the meeting room of the "Sorcerer Management Department". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was originally empty, quiet and silent, but now it sounded the rustling pen writing of Shashasha, Lu Xien is focusing on his own world. A paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the use of sound waves in the field of magical exploration from a small bat flight experiment"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As Mr. Douglas said, there are too many material worlds in which we are looking normal. We can think carefully about why it is full of mystery.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They all noticed that small bats are flying fast on dark nights, but how many people care about why they can fly in the dark without hitting any obstacles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The headline, keywords, and simple two sentences that came straight to the point directly led to the discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper format Lucien is very skilled, the difference is that there is no need to write Chinese and English abstracts, this is the general journal responsible for writing to facilitate the inclusion of journals and Used by newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Lucien asked to write a thesis when submitting the apprentice-level magic of "Bat Scream" is because the improvement result may not involve the current arcane. Knowledge is only confirmed and completed by simple experimental design. It is well known that ancient magic is to create and improve magic by studying the magic lines and structures of simulated magic creatures. The "bat scream" is exactly the same, but now the object becomes ordinary. biological. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, why waste the arcane points that the paper might get? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the experiment, Lucien has not done it yet, but it is easier to reverse the process and process the data with the correct results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the accident, I noticed this, so I caught a small bat, covered my eyes and let it go. Surprised, the bat is unaffected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two sets of control experiments, a group of different materials including magic materials to cover the eyes of the bat, to prevent Its eyes are special to see through ordinary cloth. The other group tested the bat's eye condition by reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unbelievably, this type of small bat eyes are close to blindness, so how do they 'see' the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there are several sets of controlled experiments, which exclude the reasons for wings and mental strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final set of experiments was to destroy the bat’s ear and nose and mouth structures, respectively, and to determine the sound reflection from the ear’s listening to the nose and mouth organs. Location and flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the exploration experiment is to improve the "bat scream" apprenticeship through many experiments through the "Homerz's cough" sound wave magic. The process of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is what Lucien himself did, it’s easy to write, the only problem is to modify some of the links, and people can’t see Lucien in It is indeed a high frequency sound wave from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing the text, Lucien wrote: "Because the structure of the bat's nose and nose and the structure of the brain are complex, I can't simulate it with my knowledge and ability. Use this as a casting material to release this apprenticeship magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... "I hope my experiment will give you an inspiration for the application of different frequency sound waves in magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read the paper carefully and feel that there is no problem, Lu Xien wrote "Bat Scream" on another piece of parchment. This apprentice-level magic requires specific models, spells, and spellcasting materials, which are submitted as new spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing these parchment papers, Lucien looked at the wall clock in the conference room, only five o'clock: "Oh, it only took thirty minutes. When you get there, you can make a good paper. Then you only hope that the Magic Council has no similar research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect is not small, because Ann Nick did not have similar apprenticeship magic in their arcane and magical bases, and even if someone did a similar study, reducing their requirements to apprenticeship was an improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the conference room, Lucien first saw Lazar, who was walking back and forth in the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the door open, Lazar suddenly turned and his voice eagerly asked: "Evans, I heard Mr. Eric say you are writing a thesis?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
