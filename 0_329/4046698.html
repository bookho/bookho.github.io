			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" After the monster stopped laughing, there was no attack, but a serious look at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed a single eye: "The King of Angels" Mekantron is the incarnation of Tanos, the six blazing angels are the first six The legendary magician refining, so combined with various clues, can be initially judged, the conspirators behind the scenes are the first missing Vicken, 'Disaster King' Viken."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disaster King", Viken's legendary career, is also his nickname, describing him as a disaster to the world, to life, to the human heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?" The monster seems to be really going to listen to Lucian’s reasoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the important item left by Tanos is 'Platinum Scepter' in the hands of the Pope, not in the 'World of the Doors', it means that someone is from here. Leaving, took away the 'Platinum Scepter' and took away the important reliance on mastering the power of Heaven Mountain." Rhein tacitly helped Lu Xien to pick it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently: "So, without any other direction, you can temporarily use the pope as the "conspirator" Viken, and reason There is a very contradictory place here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what?" The monster asked very cooperatively, without any signs of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As the original winner, the six legendary magicians were refining the sacred devil of the blazing angels, and they would be betrayed by the "king of angels". Being betrayed by Thrad, what does this mean? It shows that He cannot effectively control the mountains of heaven and control the 'world of the door.'" Lucien used the word "He" instead of Viking. Without exception, he is now genuine. Kind of god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the situation is completely controlled, Viken will lose control of Paradise Hill, indicating that there must be something else happening at the time, also indicating here. There is enough existence to confront Him that he does not dare to easily step into the 'world of the door'. Without often coming, the control of the 'king of angels' and the blazing angels will obviously be gradually weakened, plus that The existence against him will definitely affect the 'king of angels', and the situation of betrayal is justified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien talks, Just as this is not a battlefield where life and death are on the front line, but a podium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to say the existence of the dead spirit world?" The monster actually chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and looked at him: "No, he is obviously unable to take on such an important responsibility in the immortal martyrdom waiting for recovery. What I want to say is You, you let Wicken not dare to re-enter the 'world of the door'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for the monster to answer, in the slightly surprised look of Rhein, Lucy En raised his right hand and pointed at the monster: "If it weren't for you, why are the paper fragments, puppet components, magic notebooks, and experimental records stored here, not destroyed by Viken?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it weren't for you, why would we encounter such a clue as soon as we came in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If not you Why can Sarder happen to meet the 'king of angels'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not you, why can he leave safely from the world of the door?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren't for you, why did the mysterious fragments in Sarde open? Why do you want to engrave? To bring us here, to see the operation of magic <br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "If not you, why every fight, you will nonsense, give us a chance to escape? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A doubt can be said to be a coincidence, but there are two places, five places, there must be other reasons behind it!<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein wakes up and looks at the monster: "You left these, just to uncover the true face of Viken and seek to deal with his helper?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rare silence of the monster, no speech.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien looked at it seriously "I think, you are not willing to guard the 'world of the door', but are controlled by Viken, leaving all kinds of restrictions, so you can't leave here, so you need the help of the outside world. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, you should be another resurrection method left by the 'Sun King' Tanos, but it is seen by Viken, so you are a kind of god-like existence, so you can 'help' Salde to display 'God降术'!!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, the same as the existence of the level of the gods, the limitations of Viken must have a lot of loopholes for you, so you He left the 'world of the door' and went out to develop the truth of the gods. He half got rid of his limitations. However, the restrictions still exist. You have to attack and kill every life that enters the 'door world'. Things are leaked directly to us, so you use other means to remind you of the opportunity to escape with nonsense and teasing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stares at the monster A sentence of language is like a round of artillery:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that the trace of the Tanos laboratory war should be the return of Viken and you You have not failed, and he has not won, letting you save some of the experimental records!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Mr. Muskilllin and MacLeod will be reminded by you that at the last moment you understand who the real murderer is, so he will tell me that sometimes we think The enemy, perhaps our best helper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am right? Mr. Monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster was silent, and suddenly he laughed: "There are a few places that are wrong. For example, when you found the Tanos Lab, before tracking to Wicken, I really can only show a higher order than the target person. To the strength of the half-order, otherwise the ability to explore memory and imitation will be lost, that is, the weakened version of the 'Tanos demon' ability, which is a natural limitation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So, you confess? Mr. Monster?" Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster smiled twice: "You are very smart, but unfortunately, I still want to kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to have not heard the death sentence, calmly and elegantly smiled: "It doesn't matter, you don't have to kill, I will die by myself."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The monster's tone seems a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien right hand presses the chest, once again slightly squatting, walking the gentleman's etiquette:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't waste Mr. Monster your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, his arms stretched like a human cross, and the black double-breasted long dress spread out to the left and right. The thin bracelet has a faint silver-gray color that extends into the vest pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he fell straight back, his hair swayed by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big pit full of magical patterns behind Lucien. The position of his cross-like landing is just the center of the bottom of the pit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a black bat swarmed and dragged Lucien, which was the intention of Rhine to understand Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the clouds of countless small bats, Lu Xien, who opened his arms, fell to the core of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Monster, don't know what to call you?" The magical pattern around Lucien lit up and asked the last question in the mouth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster looked at Lucian and fell backwards, and his face gradually showed a satisfied smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he looked at Lucien, who was lying at the bottom of the pit, colliding with the line of sight in his monocle, and it looked completely clear. A vulgar, white-haired old man, he chuckled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long time ago, I was also called Wicken..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Lucien looked at him in surprise, and suddenly appeared in his mind the "fracture" puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic pattern is completely lit, the monotonous silence of black and white gray power and the bright and vigorous milky power re-emerge, and meet together, death and life, ** With sacred, dark and bright, strangely entangled with Lucien and Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
