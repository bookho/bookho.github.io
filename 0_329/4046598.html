			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s voice did not fall, and he saw Lucien slamming into two, one left and one right apart, again performing the “simulation”, then Two roads appeared on the two sides of the Sean. A total of four roads were separated by Sean and surrounded by themselves. This is the use of mirroring by both Lucien and the "Imitation". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really troublesome to fight with the Master. Gordon is not able to cast magical or magical items such as magical knowledge. It can only be bitten into a silver-gray sword light, relying on the knight’s intuition. To attack, and this level of the Cavaliers has a lot of means of range attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he hasn’t had time to rush out, suddenly he heard Lucien whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, his monocle illuminates a layer of shimmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s heart sinks, and the Archmage or other high-ranking magician is nearby, although he is a bit skeptical that Lucien is bluffing, but here is Lun Tate, near Aringe, is the highest density of magicians in the world, and the Magic Council is quite ample when it is in action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record to the Cardinal of Sald, who faced the Pope’s majesty, Gordon’s desire to fight, the sword’s forward Draw a curve and fly away in the other direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just flew out, the color around him quickly faded, leaving only the black ash without life, the whole person solidified in the air, like a bug in amber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic, "Time to stop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midair, Morris’s figure emerged, and as the situation progressed smoothly, there was even a spectacular scene of “God Fall” to “God Drop”. - Anyway, it doesn't happen to you. It can be enjoyed as a classic opera, so he is in a good mood. Silver-gray eyes look at Lucien and snorted: "How do you know that I am nearby?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope and Thrall have gone to the height of 10,000 meters, so I think that you, Lord Morris, you should come in." Sean will not say that he is indeed swindling Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien always believes in "call support", at most thirty seconds, Lord Morris and other great wizards will come over to help. But don't think it works immediately, but if you can scare Gordon directly, then you save 30 seconds. If you can't, you have the magic power of seven rings after you are suppressed, even if you don't use the Knights. Transforming, playing the role of the left hand, still afraid that it can not support for half a minute? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Gordon has the "Angel's Advent" possession and the "Ground Heaven" increase, reaching the level of the 9th-level gold knight, Lucien also believes inconspicuous The magic can help you to withstand at least a minute, not to mention the nine-ring reel "The ultimate destruction of the ball", the two tubes can be used to "curtain". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I didn’t expect was that Lord Morris came so fast that his primary goal was to be the control center of the enchantment of the enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Gordon’s body seems to have a light bloom slowly, weakening the effectiveness of time to stop, Morris put away a smile and told Lucien: "You Going to control the center, I will deal with him. After all, he is also a member of the Holm royal family. It is easier for others to accept it when I die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En did not hesitate, the four figure rushed to the control center, and silently thanked the "preplan" for details, otherwise it would be so easy for them to break through Gordon's block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien also understands that it is absolutely impossible for Thrad to arrange to control the enchantment center of God. Gordon should be his. After killing Natasha, he calmed the nobility of the Holm Kings. What should have appeared here is the "heart of time" Ketonia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of his direct encounter with the Pope, how much "loyalty" does Ketonia have for his death? Not to mention that there is also a "night walker" Winston will stop him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nearby palace, there are two mustaches. Winston seems to stand easily by the floor-to-ceiling window, to the side of the road to Ketonia: "Sa Held directly to the Pope, even if there is a gods down as a card, it is at best the end of the game, Lord Ketonia, do you want to shoot me?" Because Ketonia is the epic hero who created the Kingdom of Holm, and It is the legendary third-order, Winston, who is a legendary "little guy" nearly a hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter sentence is almost the same as those that Winton said to Winston before, as if with time vicissitudes, he looked silently outside, watching Lucian start to crack the defensive layer outside the control center of the enchantment enchantment - The transformation here involved an epic knight who guarded the place. Lucien was afraid of causing Sarder's vigilance and had not played the idea here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he sighed and turned to walk deep into the thick carpeted room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winston smiled and looked at Lucien again, thinking about whether to quietly help him and save everyone's time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he found that everything in his body was slowing down, like falling into a muddy swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword flashed, but failed to win in Winston, he emerged from another shadow, the whole person is like the shadow of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hertor Ketonia, you..." Winston looked at the steadfast Ketonian Road, but he was always vigilant and never relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia sighed softly: "Some things, there is no way to turn back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I have not been able to find the third-order road promotion, I should still be able to block you from your Excelonia, you are not waiting for it?" Winston believes that even Ketonia can Breaking through myself, the situation outside should also be the point where he can't pull back, so try to make the last persuasion. If it is not necessary, and the heart is biased towards the Magic Council, he is not willing to face and strength more than himself. The heart of the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia shook his head and said: "You and I are all knights, and the determination of the will is very clear to each other. I know that I hope, but I also have to try Live, instead of standing here waiting for the end, even if you die, you will die on the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two broke out in a fierce battle and both were pulled into the ground. Heaven." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the epic knight’s battles require more space, they quickly broke through the magic defense and fought in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha wearing a silver-gray armor with a golden crown The sword of truth was inserted on the stage in front of the podium. The crystal clear eyes looked around the hall, and the voice was majestic and loud: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church and Magic Council There was a frontal battle, and it was time for us to make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is to follow the church, eradicate evil, return to the beginning of the North-South split, or help magic The parliament, expelling the radical church, directly attributed the faith to the Lord, the religious reform advocated by Richard Cardinal, and merged the split church with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you choose the former, the Magic Council is likely to escape to the depths of the endless ocean after suffering a certain loss. At that time, we are facing the front line of the Magic Council. I believe that the Church also depends on us, plus The new balance will be reached in the presence of northern heretics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "If the latter is chosen, the Magic Council also has to rely on us and the split temperate sects against the church. This is also a new balance, and there is no need to worry about the assassination of radical clerics and watchmen, and it is quite calm. The situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key to fighting victory is in our hands, what is your choice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp At this point, Natasha deliberately paused, and the aristocrats present understood the meaning of Her Majesty the Queen. The horrible battle scene outside reminded them that everything is real. Similarly, they are very clear regardless of choice. Which one, as long as it is the winner, can protect the interests of himself and others. The only requirement is not to stand on the team and find that he is on the side of failure, so I have to look at the changes in the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of Rex with a white hair set stood up, and the low and thick voice sounded: "Her Majesty, we are the sons of the Lord." People, our faith does not need to be skeptical. Since we can all achieve a new balance, we can protect our interests. Why not choose the church? Why mix with the evil magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
