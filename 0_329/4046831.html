"I don't seem to see the Speaker of the Magic Council." It was the consul of the ancient magical empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently coughed, turned his head and smiled: "I was very envious of this style of magic when I was a child. Master, worshipping the lord of the Sylvester's Magic Empire, the singer of the glory of the Stars, so they have been imitating them after becoming a formal magician until the magical empire is destroyed, and they have to survive in the dark and crack, in order not to Strikingly, I gradually followed the trend of clothing, slowly became the gentleman dressed, and then used to become natural, too lazy to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words with a touch of memories and emotions, it seems that the heart is not as calm as the surface, in this crucial moment when the sun may be found, even if it has experienced thousands of years and countless encounters, he is also difficult to maintain a state of turmoil, after all, This is his chase Most of their lives "thing", since the establishment of the Department of astrology Passing the torch from generation to generation magician desire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The past magician dress is really mysterious and majestic, but too gloomy and too depressed is too scary." Lucien replied casually, anyway, he prefers Double-breasted long dress, tuxedo and other clothing styles, "Mr. and Mr. Bergner did not come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and "Prophet" Begner is Douglas only One of the few remaining friends, how can such an important moment not appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and said: "The urgent need for a stable reactor has made Fernando anxious. He and Haciwa are busy with the detailed experiments of the neutrons, striving to discover the mysteries as early as possible. And he is not optimistic about the result of my 'finding' the sun, so I use the actual action to cool my mind with the expectation of the heart, lest I be hit by too much disappointment."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is no hope without hope." Lucien said humorously, then gently beheaded, "The teacher always thought that the reason for not finding the planet must be with the eccentricity of the endless ocean. Regardless of why the secret of 'global flight' cannot be solved, the existence of the planet must not be found. This is not a purely 'gravitational lens' effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Hearing that Wayne repeated the view of Fernando, Douglas glanced at him sharply: "Do you think so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien If you disagree with this point of view, he will not waste it.  repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am close to the teacher's point of view, but..." Lucien answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, if you don't try it, how do you know the problem?" Douglas did not show any anger, and showed himself in the tone of Lucien. Attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "I think so too. Sometimes, knowing that an experimental design is wrong, you have to finish it completely. Because in special circumstances, the experience of failure is more valuable and helps us find the right path,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiles dagger: "Your arcane idea and attitude Can help you grow up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he mentioned the "prophet": "Bergner is in a state of sorrow after the uncertainty principle The state of jealousy, originally because of general relativity, he hoped to become a legendary third-order in a short time, but now it is stagnating again, just like Donald, if it is not the experiment and the phenomenon that confirmed the surname at the time, he is afraid It has been recognized that the world has collapsed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sighed: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't say more because he couldn't accept Lucien's probabilistic interpretation and uncertainty. Of course His unacceptability is not to face the facts of the experiment, but like Fernando, he does not agree with Lucien as the surname of the microscopic particles, and believes that there should be hidden factors or variables that have not been discovered for a while. And uncertain performance of the surname, if you count the hidden variables, it is still in line with determinism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, Mr. Bergner doesn't want to see me?" Lucien said humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head with a smile: "No, the real reason is that he is busy building the 'Cosmic Observatory', well, we are ready to go." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and extended his right hand, pressing on the crystal-clear door that was encrusted with magical gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-white line illuminates, shining brilliantly, huge energy coming from every corner of the magic tower, from the "real secret" Every place comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright blue sky outside the window is suddenly dark, so dark that even a star can’t see it, and the huge energy rushes into the “gate of transmission”. Like the river water into the ocean, did not provoke a trace of guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the different colored magic stones on the “Transportation Gate” are bright and dazzling at the same time, and the hollow in the middle of the “gate” is also There are layers of fascinating light, and there are countless magic runes flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Douglas storage bag flew out of a bright, "stone" with gold-blue, sea-blue, and pure red, surrounded by On the top of Douglas, the artificial planet surrounds the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these stones, Douglas slightly decapitated Lucien, stepping into the layers of twisted light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has been watching the operation of the magic array and learning the space and time knowledge contained in it. This is a private product of countless experiences, more than Lucien was redeemed from the High Arcane Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas asked him to come and "hunt" the sun, including the meaning of his ultra-long-range space jump - the last Lutheran transmission Going to the universe, the distance is still relatively close, and it can't be called ultra-long-range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Douglas’s figure is gradually transparent in the light, Lucien has no delay, and a layer of colorful elements is condensed on the robe of the Great Arcane Cover and then follow to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and space change, whirlwind, deep darkness, even if Lucien is already a legendary third-order magician, can’t help but have the separation of the flesh and the physical collapse. Illusion, the whole person is like a residual candle in the wind, swaying, seems to be extinguished at any time, and replaced any of the Archmage, perhaps completely "lost" in this ultra-long-range space jump, the annihilation disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lu Xi’s soul was shocked, the flesh did not have a sense of dissipating, re-solidified, and there was a layer of clear and radiant light in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of layers of light, Lucien felt that he was in the universe, and countless cosmic rays of the universe were quietly coming, so the mental power swayed and sent out. An eccentric and incomprehensible mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of light Highlighted, gathered into a dreamy light scepter, creating a layered sense of time and space around Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the dangerous rays, Lucien was free to open the mental field to observe the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no hot fireball that can melt everything, no high temperature that people can’t bear, still a cold darkness, no innocent darkness In the darkness, a little clear and bright white light is quietly set on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Lucien, Douglas, wearing a black magic robe, is facing him, with a smashing "stone" around his head, and different Legendary magic completely shrouded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
