			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown town. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dragon of the Greens" Mason and the "Ice Knight" Ferred slowly descended from the air and fell to the "Rage of the Earth" Mattvi . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you already want to understand, willing to go to the 'maintainer's cabin' to accept the punishment, very wise choice." Mattwei voice provoked, It seems to contain a hint of mockery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tone is nothing in peacetime, but the adventurers in the unspeakable town who are in extreme anxiety and depression are listening to anger and being ignited. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason’s hands clenched and he managed to control his emotions: “Matvey, I want to accept the inquiries from the wizard and the magician before going to the maintenance. The lodge, you can follow me in the process, prevent me from escaping, such a request should not be too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Cavaliers and high-ranking knights Such bargaining is obviously not respecting the performance of the "maintainer", but Mason and Fred are two day knights. If they are willing to accept the punishment, similar wishes will be satisfied, and such "simple" requirements are excessive. Then there is no excessive demand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mason is also making up his mind. When accepting the inquiries from the magician and the elf, he will especially emphasize the strangeness of Matvey and others. In the case, Matvey and others did not dare to do anything to themselves even if they had other ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matvey did not smile haha ​​twice: "How can it not be too much? You waste my time! You are the Knight of Heaven, I am also the Knight of Heaven." My time is also very valuable! Mason, Fred, go to the defender's hut with me, otherwise I will start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is cold Ruthless, the last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason and Ferred looked at each other and spoke through the special secret of the blood of the "Dragon's Dragon". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have no hatred with Matvey?" Mason asked puzzledly, and Mattvi’s half-step performance could only be explained, or he would wait for himself. He has sinned against him, or he has other purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid’s eyes are beautiful ice blue, dignified: “No, we have hardly communicated with him, so he is so persecuted, half step Don't let, there must be deeper thoughts, we can't go to the defender's hut!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s instincts tell him that if he really follows Mattvi Going to the "maintainer's cabin", the two of them will face great danger, and such a dangerous premonition is in his heart, making the negative emotions he has accumulated for a long time seem to have completely erupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason nodded slightly and nodded, looking at the "Rage of the Earth": "Matvey, my request is not too much, you have the final say. We went to see the high elves and went to see the magician, judged by them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is loud and sound, so that every adventurer nearby can I heard it clearly and let the elves around the town hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who blocked the town looked over and saw that Mattvi was handling things and turned his head away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mason did not manage the elf's reaction at all, and continued to be like a dragon: "You dare not go to see the magician with us!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just a few words, they and Mattaway’s position seemed to be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, his back muscles were tight and he walked to the other side of the town without any problems, and Fred was close behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matvey suddenly sneered, screaming: "The magician and the high elf have appointed us instead of asking!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, the ground under the feet of Mason and Fred is suddenly undulating, driving the houses on the street to wobble, seems to collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abnormal Mason's stress is moving, and a loud, silvery lightning is produced out of thin air, slamming into Matvey. His body seemed to swell twice in a flash, and the skin exposed outside the black armor was covered with pale blue scales, and the gap between the scales was a jumping arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the ice-blue sword light that his sword had turned over, the earth formed a thick layer of ice and raised a sharp ice cone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Mattevi’s foot stepped apart, the reddish magma sprang up, offsetting the cold and offsetting the wind and frost. At the same time, he had one more Throw the yellow-brown giant hammer on the ground with lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high elves, the magicians and their collusion?" Mason and Ferred communicated in a special way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid flew up, the sword squatted, thick ice crystals condensed out, blocking Matte’s ground fire magma: “even if collusion, Absolutely only a small part, we will make things big and let all elves and magicians know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a knight, he is very determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to launch a blizzard-like attack in the North, he suddenly felt that the surroundings were dark, and it seemed that the place where the battlefield was located was separated from the town. Into the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rage, blizzard, a violent lightning bolt all trapped in this shadow, difficult to penetrate the outside world, causing the attention of all elves and magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow Baron!" Mason snorted, this is another town defender, he came so fast! This shows that things are really weird! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow, if a figure is absent, it will jump and flash, as if it can come out from anywhere to attack, and Fred will be firmly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattvi carrying a giant hammer, the mountain collapsed like a shot to Mason, while oscillating the air: "Others will come soon, Mason, Ferred Don't resist any more! Punished and won't die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He attacked and used language to weaken Mason and Fred's will to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in Mason’s heart is getting more and more prosperous, and the dangerous premonition is getting more and more fierce. When the teeth bite, the whole person slams open and becomes like a The illusory dragon that blends into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This illusory dragon is not clear, showing a pale green color, and the electric light on the head, body, and tail is overflowing, and then the fireworks bloom toward the surrounding Burst open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-white electric snake is covered with all the shadows, making it like a thunderous ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows become bright and are constantly being blown by the electric light of the branches. Mason uses the power of his blood and is the most powerful and taboo, just to Break the boundaries of the shadows and create a sensation that all magicians and elves can notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, life and death are in this fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "nature home", Ellers is struggling to hesitate For a while, I said: "I don't object to you searching Ms. Martha's tree house. But this will arouse the anger of all the elves who naturally hate. We need to be cautious. It is better to do this. We want to sneak in and wait to find enough power. Evidence can be thoroughly investigated without fear of opposition, and without clues, because there is no elf known, it can not cause large fluctuations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe hands In the pocket of the black long trench coat, coldly said: "Let us sneak in like a thief? What did Martha discover? Who is the risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, there is one thing. I want you to know that we are invited by you to help you investigate the causes of the abyss and pollution incidents, instead of asking us to help you solve the problem. We have doubts, we will Make suggestions, and you will cooperate fully without Take any risks, anyway, there is no reason to investigate, it is not us who are suffering, do you understand what I mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian said with a very kind smile "My Royal Highness, this is actually very simple. All the elves must contribute to the contamination of the elves. Therefore, please apply to Her Majesty to allow us to search for Ms. Martha's tree house unconditionally. I know You are very embarrassed, but we are not the masters here, we must have your cooperation to investigate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
