			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting into the hall was accused of this, but Lucien had no feelings, because he was definitely the biggest problem among the people who entered the underground palace. And the accusations, anger and resentment of the children, Lucien is not so much in mind, can they unite to beat themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is emboldened, naturally it calms down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that Sophia’s face is pale and her long, slender fingers keep vibrating: “Nonsense! When the magical array changes, I and Barak are distinguishing the road. Time to change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only you and Borak? No one else saw? Your Royal Highness, do you think we will believe it?" Alten never smiled Haha a few times, the aristocrats around him, as well as Ralph, Claire and others began to look at Sophia and "Bolaq" with suspicious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of Sophia’s urgency seems to be more and more suspected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling their gaze, Sophia trembled with anger, and the green and clear eyes burst into a misty atmosphere: "This is the underground palace of the legendary magician, I have What ability to change its magical array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not necessarily, I remember that the noble emperor has participated in the trial, and the layout is very clear. And he is now in the legendary field, with enough ability and wisdom to come up with ways to interfere with this magical array. Perhaps you will know this method under the command of your Royal Highness, and feel that you can take the trial in your own hands and be glorified. The Crown was trapped, so he chose the easy-to-control waste of Borak and paved the way for you to join the gorse family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Otherwise, why are you? Suddenly, I will inexplicably want to enter the underground palace? You are a princess who is a very expensive and loved one. Why do you take this risk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten vocally Drinking a sentence, inferring a sentence People no longer look only suspected to Sophia's eyes, has been showing a clear alert, anger, hate emotions, at any time seems to rush forward, this stunning looks pure heart unpredictable danger of "Succubus" Kill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, after hearing the accusations of Alten, Lucien also had some doubts about Sophia, regardless of purpose or means, he analyzed it so appropriately, though Most of the ingredients, but can reasonably explain why Sophia has to venture into the underground palace, why should I always pull Borak, why suddenly I like "self", showing all kinds of embarrassment, and this is also the doubts of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when did Alten have such strong eloquence and incitement? This seems to have never been his strength. Is he always trying to play the standard knight with muscles and willingness stronger than wisdom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the time Sophia was by her side, she did not have a complete "time of committing crimes". If it was a delay, she was sure to find herself during this time. ? Besides, this kind of thing, she can use another reason and "Bolaq" to say that she can get the help of His Royal Highness who does not care about his reputation and identity. "Bolaq" will certainly be grateful to zero, can't wait to kneel down and kiss her toes, use life Repaying the love of His Royal Highness Princess, it is very easy to produce all kinds of suspicions and bewares after hearing from the surrounding population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia slammed her feet in tears, tears falling in her eyes, and dripping, she turned to look at Lucien, pitifully : "Do you believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe in you from the bottom of my heart." Lucien let her look "soft and firm" while walking from the hall How far is it to calculate the secret room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s mouth is tilted up like a tulip with dewdrops, bright and beautiful, and touching: “As long as you believe me, I am not afraid of their defamation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "sentimental sweetness" of the opposite, so many aristocratic children who secretly love the princess burned in the fire, more angry, can not wait to silver The women burned together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten sees the atmosphere changing, the mood is in place, holding the right hand of the sword: "Relph, Claire, do you want to die here?" If you don't want to, then join hands and kill them, we have a way to live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the cruel and bloody situation, he seemed to believe in Alten's accusation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, Claire, what about you?" Alten stretched out the dark shield, and the complex magic runes kept flowing to prevent Sophia. Suddenly attacked with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sophia seems to be saddened by the development of things, like a heart, and there is no chance that they have not joined hands to get started, to slow down, and Lucien "smell" all kinds of strange, decided to wait and see, and speed up the cracking of the location and direction of the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Catherine, Claire wears a close-fitting scale and reveals a slim figure, except that her armor is black and less The charm of the rose, a little more glamorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She narrowed her eyes and suddenly smiled: "I? I will fight with His Royal Highness Princess and Borak!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble children can't The voice of confidence blurted out, one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Alten is calm and dignified: "Claire, are you also their accomplice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, Alten, don't talk nonsense! I chose the Princess to be the Princess, because..." Claire's slender eyebrows rose like golden willows. "I suspect the murderer behind you is this! At that time, shouldn't stop all the battles, wait quietly for Uncle Ulrich to come in and save people? This is the best way to ensure everyone's safety! Only the murderer will provoke a dispute. The opportunity for outsiders to temporarily come in. If you kill someone you want to kill, he has no chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You directly blame the princess, aiming to provoke the fight, what do you want to do? Why not Waiting for Uncle Ulrich, they are going to trace the murderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, she took the direction of her nobleman who followed and believed her to Sofia. Move and try to stay away from Alten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Still people believe us, Claire does not have the title of 'smart garland'!" Sophia’s calm face showed strong joy, this is Notice that Lucien is looking around. "What are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About remembering the surrounding arrangements of Lucian, just listening to Claire "behind the scenes murderer "The words twitched the corner of the mouth: "I am looking for a child named Conan, and then drowned him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murderer behind the scenes, the underground secret room, bloody slaughter... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Conan? I have never heard of any nobleman calling this name. It seems to be the name of Holm. When did you know him? Did he come in? What ability?” Sophia asked in confusion, she knew all the nobles who came in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn’t come in, it’s a civilian child I know. Every time I meet him, there will be bad things happening. Just now I just joked and vented my heart. Emotions." Lucien felt that he had nothing to do to find something, and suddenly he suddenly had a "humor" feeling and had to waste time "explaining". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably "understood" Lucia "Mood" Sophia gently beheaded, smiles lightly and impliedly looking at the slowly moving Claire Waiting: "I used to hate you before. Now I found out that you are so beautiful and intelligent, Claire, can you forgive my superficial past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From the beauty and strength of your Royal Highness, I am not so conspicuous." Claire smiled and turned to face Alten, secretly blinking at Lucien, saying that "cooperation" is still as agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten’s face is gloomy: “Clair, I don’t unite everyone to fight together, do you think you can wait for the assistance of the Duke’s Lord? Insidious Borak and Will Her Royal Highness give us an opportunity? Compromise and concession cannot be exchanged for safety!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" A nobleman and Ralph behind him Everyone agrees loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it too consistent? After hearing Claire’s words, no one doubts, has differences, and hesitates? When Lucien calculated the location of the Chamber of Secrets, he took the time to observe the reactions of the people to confirm the psychological knowledge they had learned during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he got a layer of cockroaches in his body. When he first rushed to Lucien, Sophia, and Claire, the steps in the hall seemed to have a sense of shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the "Knight", Lucien clasped the frosty sword with both hands and ran towards Alten, followed by Claire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A black tornado was highlighted in the assaulting team, throwing a nobleman's child high and falling heavily, directly stunned the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the five-level bloody warlock, there is no great knight's strength or five super-class items, there is no resistance at all, but Sophia seems to be restrained. There is no attempt to kill them, otherwise it will not be well explained after going out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Alten was as tough as a reef in a tornado, steadily rushing to the front of Lucien, a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien "Frost" sword swings from the bottom up, kneeling on Alten's five-level magic sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a loud bang came out, Lucien’s heart moved, and there was no strength on Alten’s sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sword, Alten flew backwards like a squally wind, just falling back and playing at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a slap in the back of Lucien, a gentle body with a scent hitting his back, then strong Magical fluctuations occur, and a transparent wall will be surrounded by all directions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Claire!" It was Sophia who hit Lucie’s back. She was angry and asked Claire, who was standing outside the transparent wall. There are countless cracks in the shield of the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Claire smirked and said: "His Royal Highness, I have always been a companion to Alten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You!" Sophia gasped, unable to speak, and Relf, ​​who was also trapped in the invisible wall, said: "Are you not related to the royal family? Why help Alten? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien frowned at the transparent wall in front of him, wondering about the way it flows and the way the runes change, so he didn't immediately shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, except for Alten, Claire, and several of his companions who were unconscious on the ground, the rest of the nobles were trapped in transparent walls, they Suddenly realized, anger accused: "The person who changed the magical array is you! Alten, you mean little man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha, ha ha ha." Alten I laughed smugly. "If you die, I will be relieved. Why should Claire compete with me for the heir of the gorse family? She will soon become a king!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it you? Brother." Sophia seemed to understand everything and smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sophia, killing you is just a matter of hand, my goal is never you, but why the father can break through the restrictions and become the reason for the legend. But can take the opportunity It’s a good thing to get rid of you. Don’t think that I don’t know what you are doing privately.” At another entrance to the hall, Prince Bayer walked in gently and calmly, and Claire greeted him and walked side by side with his face. With all the lover's radiant glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten converges with a smile and respectfully: "His Royal Highness, Lord Midalun only gave us five minutes to get started as soon as possible."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the anti-magic array, release the poisonous gas and the magic image, the only one of them is Sophia, and then go to kill Deni." Bayer is just telling one. A trivial little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten took a fist-sized colorful seal from his arms and walked to the front of Bayer to kill "Bolaq", Sophia and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the light flashed, his expression was condensed, the body could not help but fall down, the seal rolled up on the ground, and the blood berthed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia and others clearly saw that Bayer took out the long sword and did not take the slightest killing, easily piercing the heart of Alten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
