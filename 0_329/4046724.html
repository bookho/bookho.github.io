			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Aringe, Heidi did not go to the mission area to report the situation, nor did he go to the magician management department to ask the high-ranking astrologer to handle this evil magic ceremony. The materials and articles of the case went directly to the outer layer of the "Babel Tower" and entered the "atomic universe" under the guidance of the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks this thing is quite different, it is necessary to sue the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Atomic Universe", the real Tower of Babel towers into space on the Iron Planet, with a fantasy-like beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Her Majesty the Queen." Heidi just saw Natasha when she entered the door, and suddenly he hurriedly said hello. She likes and admires Natasha's surname and acting style very much, so she feels a lot of pressure and is quite nervous when facing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at Heidi’s hurried manners with a smile, rubbing his chin: “I’m not a monster to eat, is it necessary to be afraid? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am just..." Heidi hurriedly explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha waved her hand and interrupted her: "Your teacher is waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the teacher knows that I will come?" When talking about business, Heidi’s nervousness was quickly calmed down, and he asked a little puzzledly, and then waited for Natasha to answer, she thought thoughtfully. Self-speaking, "I summoned the teacher's half-face strength, maybe the teacher paid attention to the scene at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about it while she was at Nata Sha led to the study and saw the teacher sitting in the chair behind the desk and smiling at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is still a black double-breasted long dress with a slightly longer hair, and the monocular glasses worn by the left eye are shining in the light of the window. A touch of glimmer: "I probably know the previous things, you give me the materials and items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I think things are not so simple, this The magic ritual seems to hide deeper and strange things...” Heidi handed the materials and items to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I will discuss with the Speaker, the teacher, Hathaway, and this evil magic ritual can't just look at the surface." Lucien flipped the information with his hands. "You handed over the task. The next thing is not that you can participate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi solemnly nodded: "Good ", teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, as the queen of the Holm Kingdom, naturally pays attention to this matter, and after Heidi leaves, she is serious Looking at Lucien: "I feel like the seven ancient devils. Cutting off the internal organs is only a superficial ritual step. In fact, it is painful emotions... Vicken knows that you have discovered his identity, so he desperately transforms the ancient devil. The law leaked a lot, let the kingdom and the parliament themselves guilty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed is the root of everything." Lucien sighed, "as for the dimension Willing to let the night watchers secretly spread, or do not have behind-the-scenes black hands, temporarily unable to trace, only Use another method to knock it, Mingsong secretly and secretly act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha gently daggers, slightly frowning: "The ancient devil is very troublesome, difficult to remove Fortunately, the 'Sword of Truth' blood has a good effect on them. Lucien, your legendary magic is finished? Are you ready to promote the legendary third-order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For the big arcian, there is almost no obstacle to the promotion of the third order. Lucien has enough important papers published in the past two years, so it is only half a step away from the third order, but from the third order to the peak is one. Daguan, before the release of Lucien's new alchemy, there were only two legendary peaks in the seven Arcane Arcane divisions! And Oliver, Helen, and Vicente have never broken through in the era of great arcane development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the peak to the gods, so many legendary peaks in countless years, only Tanos and Viking success, there are hidden dangers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two legendary magics of 'The Wrath of the Snow Goddess' and 'Silent Dark Blue' have been solved and I have obtained the information I want. I am combining these. Harvest improved 'Winter Goddess of Wrath', making it a new legendary magic." Lucien had no concealment of Natasha, and talked about his current work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are nine legendary magics built in the soul of Lucien, namely "atomic fission", "vengeance gaze", "time and space scepter", "the unsure hand of Evans", "luxury cracking", " "After the steep", "spiritual blast", "storm enchantment" and "mirror of fate", until the improved "Winter Goddess of Wrath" is completed and successfully constructed, can reach the peak of the legendary second-order, and then rely on "eternal "Chongyang" advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha curiously looks at Lucien: "Improved? Are you not so small from these two legends of ice and snow?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temperature is the embodiment of molecular thermal motion. The more intense the movement, the higher the temperature, and vice versa. At the legendary level, the conventional cooling process and the casting medium can no longer be better. The effect, so I need to analyze these two ice and snow legends, find some models of their temperature reduction, corresponding to the meaning of the Arcane, the results are similar to my expectations, saving me the time to rebuild the model, just do A certain degree of improvement, and this method also plays an important role in the micro-field research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the legendary magic data on the desk . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is not disgusted with the contents of Lucien, and is even interested: "I heard that it is because of the legendary magic of ice and snow. The meaning of the technique is unclear, so the legendary magicians of the Palmera Lodge are relatively weak, because they can only be constructed by mental strength and superficial understanding. Often, many legends of ice and snow are difficult to learn and can not exert the maximum effect. Ms. Helen is an outstanding arcane master. When she learns the 'Wolf of the Snow Goddess', she basically relies on forcible construction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she is more Curiously said: "What the harvest do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Lucien thought about it, describing the use of magnetic fields or lasers with as simple as possible words. The idea of ​​constraining atomic and molecular vibrations will bring the legendary magic of ice and snow closer to absolute zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha heard the eyes lose their focal length, stood up violently, and laughed twice: "I have to go through the blood, I feel more and more Close to the legendary field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Natasha’s hurried departure, Lucien shook his head and took out an invitation from the drawer. , which reads: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Principal: For the current development of the microscopic field and the various theories of the new alchemy, the school's magicians are full of doubts and difficulties Even the teachers who teach the lectures themselves are hard to understand... I wonder if we can be lucky enough to invite you to an open class to sweep away the fog in the direction of the teachers and students..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression was quiet, thoughtful, suddenly, he slammed on the invitation and said: “Pinocchio, you let Leo go to Holt School of Magic, tell They, I will hold an open class in the microscopic field after a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he looked at the direction of the magic laboratory, they used "a hundred head ghost dominant eye" to exchange materials and numerous improvements and adjustments magic, which come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master." Pinocchio replied cheerfully, and he seemed to be so carefree forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest rated group meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien told Heidi’s mission report about it, and finally said: “It’s not hard to see that this is very similar to the special call of the Wicken’s. The ritual of cutting the internal organs into a living dead is in order to make the magician full of pain. The reason why his strength will improve is not because of the surface of the ritual, but because the painful devil has been projected into his mind."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took over the words of Lucien, looking around all the members of the highest panel, solemnly said: "The details of the ancient devil can only be read by high-level magicians, and this level of magic There is no special reason for the division to deal with this strange and unpredictable devil. Therefore, I suspect that Viken deliberately revealed the real way to become a god, so that some magicians are excited..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the incomplete information we have mastered, we can know that if we want to be a kind of god, it is impossible to convert light into ancient devils, and we must have the corresponding power of faith to gather together. We must scrutinize Kind of cult, which I will make with the state religion Holm, I hope you do not ignore this issue "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
