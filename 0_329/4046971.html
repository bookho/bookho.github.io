			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando felt a sigh of relief in the chest, how could not spit it out, this old fox actually deceived everyone! What's even more damn is that he also hinted in advance, watching himself like a drama and being misled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder he doesn’t worry about the “dark blue gift” that Sharp will repent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando endures anger and follows Anord to fly out of the forest. The aftermath of the legendary strongman battle can destroy this place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is your lord's strength restored to the third order?" Douglas repeated one of Fernando's questions. At this time, he was more concerned about the two sides. Strength comparison, others are fine details, you can wait until the end of the matter to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the forest, light and shadow changes, snowflakes are flying, as if there are countless ghosts wandering inside, people are chilling, Annold squinted and looked back. Laughing like a real fox: "The lord of death" was devastated by the pope, and his body, soul, and life were all broken. He was completely degraded. Fortunately, the Pope did not use 'God'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later's death lord's soul core preserved by legendary mystery, combined with the soul fragments of many others, resurrected in the way of alchemy life, Reinventing the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind connection, he is not in a hurry to talk about the death lord, it seems that there is no doubt about the outcome of this battle, After all, the death lord is the legendary peak of the past, and it is the terrorist power of the undead army. Even if the strength is seriously declining now, there is no problem in dealing with a "time heart" that has not yet been promoted to the third-order: <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, such hidden dangers are enormous, the fragments are in conflict with each other, the main consciousness is often disturbed, and most of the spell models become incomplete. Therefore, the strength cannot be restored for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Until more than a decade ago, by the in-depth study and mastery of the soul, Sir Tananos slowly absorbed other fragments completely, which slowly restored the strength of the legendary third-order, perhaps for decades. He can return to the peak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the problem is not big..." Fernando said subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is based on the judgment of reality. After a long twilight war, everyone knows a little. In the same situation, the magician is stronger than the knight. The clergyman’s, but the interval between the growth of the magician is too long. Far higher than the two, especially the latter, so it slowly fell to the disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Necromancer, who symbolizes death, resurrection, and life, is one of the three most powerful types of magicians because of his deep understanding of the soul. And more deadly and more amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even if Ketonia is a variant of the "Time Dragon" blood, it is a powerful knight who can compete with the same level mage, facing a dead spirit higher than himself. Master, there will be no hope of winning, just to see if he can escape the fleeting opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord smiled and did not respond to Fernando’s words. Instead, he actively explained the actions to the two people: "In fact, while contacting the organizations such as 'Red Eyes' and 'Soul High', I also tried to say hello to the three legendary lords and got satisfactory. The answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are very fast, have reached the edge of the Black Forest, so go back together and look at the battlefield of the legendary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the fog of the souls of countless souls floating and struggling, a shimmering ray of light flew out, all the way. All the obstacles are like phantoms, and there is no delay in it for a moment, as if they are in different time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of time is really strong..." Douglas sighed with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, because the snow and ice dance and appear a slightly brighter sky. As soon as it faded, a huge dragon circling, its muscles rotted, the bones were visible, the pus was flowing, and the pale flame was spit in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned out to be a "Dragon Lich", a legendary undead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air nearby, two huge figures appeared again. One was a mummified with a yellow-brown strip. The tyrannical atmosphere allowed Douglas and Fernando to feel in the distance. One is the monster with only the skeleton left. It is bigger than the dragon lich, as if it were the bones left by the legendary sea monster after the death of Wang Yangli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary dead spirits, under the entanglement of their respective auras, have been invested in the deep darkness created by the "Dragon Lich", so that The last embarrassment of the "Time" was also obscured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, undead creatures such as demons, zombies, skinless dogs, mummies, dead souls, ghosts, etc. are like raging tides, and the climbing is covered with " dark". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" A legendary necromancer is terrible to a terrible degree, especially if he is a 'death lord' profession known for his mastery of the undead army. Tonia is finished..." Fernando is deeply involved in the Necromancer, and seeing the scene at this time is inevitably a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the legendary professions of the Necromancer, whether it is the "Pale of the Pale" or the "Half God Lich", although the same "helper" is numerous, but both Compared with the "death lord" who uses this as a "full-time", these two professions are more inclined to death spells, soul attacks, and secret states. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Pope ruined the main "legion" of the "Death Lord", he would be able to withstand most of the legends of the Greater Holm area. You must know that when he was at its peak, there were two legendary third-order necromancers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of the forest are dark, no sound leaks, quiet to the extreme, both strange and horrible, people can not understand the progress of the battle, so Fernando had no choice I took back my eyes and continued the "topic" just now: "Satisfactory answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the old fox did not say that only with the cooperation of the nobility can you impress three Is the organization of the legendary mage joining? Is he deceiving again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod looked at him and Douglas, and the old god was in the tunnel: "Although Lord Tananos was dissatisfied with the empire’s move, he was unwilling to go to Aalto to help. However, as one of the strongest players who once stood at the top of the world, he does not lack judgment on the situation, understand that this is the last chance to save himself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The vast majority of the main church is dragged down by the Abra, Dracula, Danisos and other legendary lords and the legendary empire of the empire in the west. It must be saved! Once the dust settles, it may even be sewers." The mice are not as good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last chance, either to die or to live better, we understand. Among them, among these magicians The elite also understand that even if I don't contact 'hello', they should have acted recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of here, Annod laughs A cry: "They didn't value us very much, but Sharp's entrustment gave me inspiration. With this action, from the beginning, the real goal is the 'heart of time' Ketonia, the most promising epic knight among the nobility, and the closer to the church's strong."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that Sharp had been commissioned at random, and had not done more confirmation, so you are actively promoting it!" Fernando felt more and more worried. I didn't even see this. I didn't think about it until now, only to realize that the old fox's attitude was overwhelming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod laughed and said nothing, but Douglas nodded and said: "Even we all believe that this time is to assassinate Alfonso, how can Ketonia Would you doubt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if Rigg is not a traitor? The heart of time is not coming?" Fernando has understood that the completion of Sharp's commission is only The camouflage of the surface is used to cover up the real target, but there are still some doubts in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord laughed like a fox who stole the chicken: "The real goal is Alfonso. By assassinating him, he provokes the contradiction between the nobility and the church." , and draw some of the great aristocrats represented by Sharp, and get a space for survival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Fernando looked at Anord and felt that he couldn't keep up with his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod smirked: "First of all, you have to remember our path at all times: to draw up the nobility and to provoke their relationship with the church, so whether it is besieging the pro The church's 'heart of time', or assassination of Alfonso, is all for this road. Only the former works better, the latter is second."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
