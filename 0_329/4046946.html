			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪嗒, the sound of the door lock twisting open is loud in the silent night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blond-haired little boy was originally lying on the sofa, half-sleeping and half-awake, at this time, he turned over and sat up, his face full of excitement and happiness, 蹬蹬He ran to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, a blonde woman wearing a lavender court dress came in, she was bright and moving, tall and tall, and her face was not obvious. Red, smile and dignified with a bit of flattery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Edward, you haven't slept yet?" This mature glamorous lady saw the little boy running towards herself, clearly showing a surprised look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy smiled slightly shyly: "Mom, I want to wait for you to come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, his words came to an abrupt end, because he saw a tall man standing behind his mother. His facial features were like a knife, handsome and cold, like an iceberg that never changed, with a very special silver white. short hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man suddenly appeared a gentle smile, like the arrival of spring, melting snow, holding the hand of the blonde lady, kissed: "Can you know It’s my pleasure, I wish you a good dream tonight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m also very happy to meet you, Viscount.” Ms. Blonde smiled and responded. The man in formal wear left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mom, who is he?" Little boy Edward didn’t know why he hated the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, a foreign viscount I met at the dance today, surnamed Karendia." Ms. Blonde replied plainly, but her mouth was forbearing. Can not hold up, then she looks pretty, "Edward, now close to twelve o'clock, more than two hours of normal sleep, Adeline? I have to ask her why agree to wait for me! You are this family Only the immediate bloodline can't be too capricious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I sneak out of the room, not about Adeline..." Boy Edward made a poor look, and he knew that his mother only taught himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master, maybe you will have a new father." A maid I whispered to Edward, who grew a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy, who is still young, has a gloomy face and a sullen sorrow. In the past two years, the mother and the Viscount of Kareldia are getting closer and closer. It seems that there is really a tendency to be together. I am getting less and less love from my mother. It is a hateful man to chat and play with her less and less time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the lord is called after the Lord, the wife is very hard to support this family, and the pursuit of happiness should be blessed, but you must remember, you must remember It is the sole heir to the title and inheritance, and cannot allow the Viscount Kareldia to transfer the property a little bit.” The maid who is loyal to this family reminds Edward to take precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward blurted out: "He came to my mother for money and knighthood? No, I must stop him!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the boy ran to the hall, leaving a stunned maid, I, I just remind you to pay attention, there is no such meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mom, I am wrong, I shouldn’t be polite to the Viscount!" Not long after, the cry of Edward came from the living room. He was pressed down on the sofa by his mother, slamming his ass and crying so well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Blonde snorted and apologized to the iceberg-like Count of Karendia: "Sorry, I didn't teach my children."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the children of this age are so naughty," said the Count of Karen Erdia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Edward, apologize to the Viscount." Ms. Blonde said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward convulsed and apologized, and then the mother did not pay attention, made a fierce appearance, very whispered: "I will not let you steal the mother! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will call the Viscount Dad in the future." Ms. Blonde said to Edward a little shyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward pouted and tried to make himself faceless: "Yes, Mom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting opposite the dining table, Viscount Kareldia cut the bloody steak, serious like a real father to Edward Road: "Your knight teacher is not good enough, I will teach you personally tomorrow."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I will definitely work hard." Edward squirmed his fist and vowed to make the damn man angry in training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Edward was thrown to the ground and he cried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is it useful to cry, what do you want to do with swordsmanship?" Viscount Kareldia did not deplore the truth. "So, you are just a child, not a man." The real man will not cry even if he bleeds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward stood up and stared at him in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia waved the wooden sword in his hand: "Don't you hate me? Don't you want to drive me away? Then use your hands." Knight sword to complete it! Or you are a coward, like to fail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward made a fierce yell and raised a wooden sword to Karendi The Ayajue, who was beaten to the ground again and again, stood up again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't compromise with you!" he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the church square, a cross stands there, a mature glamorous The blonde lady is tied to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom! Mom!" Under the restraint of several knights, Edward struggled to cross the cross, tears in his face, and panic in his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop holds the holy emblem of the truth, draws a cross on the chest, and points to the blonde lady: "She is a nobleman, but she is in the dark and becomes a slave to the vampire." Trying to turn the Lord's Lamb into a vampire's food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde lady seems to have lost her soul, staring at the bishop, without a word, and Edward loudly The ground retorted: "No! No! My mother has not hurt anyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop completely ignored Edward and continued: "You are evil, Dirty, but the Lord is merciful, merciful, purification is His gift, and is your way to heaven. I want to ask you, are you willing to repent, do you want to regain your feet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If, if I regret, can Edward get amnesty? He is just a child, know nothing!" Blonde lady seems to have come alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop painted the cross: "The Lord is just and strict. As long as Edward can survive the fire, it means he is not guilty."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Blonde smiled sternly: "Ha ha ha, then I will answer you, rather in the hell, to pursue, not to lose yourself in heaven!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sinner, go to hell and confess." The bishop's voice chilled out a light, igniting the firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Edward cried, crying, and seemed to be able to see the gentle eyes of his own eyes through the burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Edward directly fainted, and suddenly, a voice rang in his ear: "Sorry, I am late."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward tried to open his eyes and saw the man whose mother was burned to death. He gnashed his teeth and said: "It’s all! If not you, how can your mother be tied? "The fire box!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am late." Viscount Kareldia was stunned, like an iceberg with an avalanche. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
