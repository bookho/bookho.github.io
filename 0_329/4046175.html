			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the third floor is very different from that of the second floor. The first thing that looks into Lucian’s eyes is a blue-and-white living room with rows of rows on both sides. The windows, the sun shines in, making it extremely bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This living room is a lot smaller than the lobby on the first floor, but the sofas stacked at random, a round table of coffee table size, one piece hanging on the wall The small black writing board behind the face or high chair, the green potted plants in a basin, all give a strange and vigorous feeling in the mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen young boys and girls in the living room, the longest may be fourteen or five years old, the youngest is only about twelve years old, they are either sitting On the sofa, on the round table in front of me, I was concentrating on the calculations. Three or four people were surrounded by small blackboards and discussed seriously, letting Lucien almost think that he had entered a place like a study salon and a learning club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because the people who designed the third floor thought about not letting people from the stairs directly disrupt the atmosphere, so this living room is facing the other side, let Lucy En and Tom can only see the back or side of the teenagers, plus a thick carpet to cover the footsteps, without disturbing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annick, this "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" is very interesting, and the three basic laws of force field seem simple, you can think about it. But it sums up the rules of our magical force, and it seems to be able to spread to some of the phenomena in normal life." The girl who sounds like a bird sounds, she whispered to the companion next to the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were sitting back to back on the sofa halfway around Lucian and Tom, the yellow-haired fluffy teenager looked up "Lei Riya, I heard Mr. Astar said that this book "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" contains one of the two pillars of the modern magic system. If you can thoroughly understand it, perhaps Can become a formal magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another girl with long linen hair next to him said: "Lei Riya, Annick, you are still only Looking at the first part? I probably flipped it over the past few days and found that the third part is beyond imagination. It tries to explain the movements and phenomena of the whole world with the concept of 'force', including stars, tides, etc., and will star and The force between the earth is named as gravity, which leads to the trajectory of the stars, etc. We seem to be able to refer to the magic of the stars in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya Black hair with a jumping pony tail, with her nod movement: Grace, it seems to be, but how can I not understand the process of derivation, and the mathematical methods called calculus, I can not understand how to calculate, Heidi, Annick, what about you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also, just like watching a fairy tale, I can't figure it out completely." The long hair in the linen, the sound seems to be a little up the Heidi. Answering it intentionally, "But isn't Mr. Astar giving us the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy"? Before you become a formal magician, you only need to remember a few theorems and formulas. There is no need to fully understand and Make it clear. What we need to learn now is "The Foundation of Magical Geometry", "The Mapping of Magical Principles to Model Construction Processes", "The Marking Meaning of Constructing Graphics", "Elemental Equations Behind Magical Formulas", "Elemental Preliminary", "Common Algebra Problems" Low-order meditation categorization, "The Analysis of the Nature of Cold and Heat," "The Role of Movement and Power in Magic," etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to show off a bit Your own memory, will be one We need to learn to push back the books completely out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to Heidi, you think about it, and Mr. Astar did say that if you can fully understand the mathematical principles of magical philosophy. ", then systematically learn calculus for a year, and wait until the mental strength is sufficient, you are qualified to try to become a mid-level magician." Lei Yi Liya echoed Heidi Road, "But you have so many magic basic books, we are all I don't know when I can finish it. Without the teacher's teaching, I am afraid that it will take more than fifteen years. Now I look at a few pages every day and I feel dizzy. Oh, I don't know when I can become a formal magician."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices who don’t want to be official magicians are not good apprentices. Of course they have their own ambitions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick scratched his yellowish hair: "I don’t know how long it will take if I want to learn by myself, but Mr. Astar does not say it. Wait until Aringe, will the parliament arrange for a formal magician to teach us? Then maybe four or five years to finish, there is enough power to attack the level of the magician, when..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Yiya is also very eager to say: "And the parliament also promised that when we become a formal magician, we will send our parents and relatives to countries such as Holm or Colette."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people were silent for a while and sighed in unison: "The official magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing quietly behind the stairs of their sofa Listening to Tom, the thin and gloomy face showed a rare smile: "They three, with Sprint, Olmos, Katrina, are the teenagers who have become apprentices in this appraisal. Among them, Sprint and Katrina are both spiritual and arcane talents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while pointing to the blackboard Guiding someone else's dark red-haired boy Sprint, quietly writing the calculation of the brown-haired juvenile Olmos, and the three girls discussing the problem with the tall blonde girl Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all good kids." Lucien answered with a tone that belongs to the official magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between the two people alarmed the apprentices who were studying and discussing in the living room. They turned around or looked up directly and then politely saluted: "Hello. Mr. Tom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mr. Tom is a strongman of the Cavaliers and naturally deserves such respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom is not so gloomy in the face of these energetic, slightly naive children, he smiles: "I want to praise you so hard. However, "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" is our speaker. The greatest arcane master, Lord Douglas, first elaborated on the works of his own arcane theory. He has the most mainstream mathematical tool calculus he invented, so it is not You can now understand and master, don't blindly study the magic pearl in the history of magic and delay the normal arcane and magic learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He It is a second-level knight, but grew up in Ariel, and there is no shortage of common sense about magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Mr. Tom for your teaching." Sprint, who had a layer of faint fluff on his lips, stood up and answered, handsome and slightly embarrassed. He seems to be the leader of these dozen magic apprentices, proudly said, "I have never delayed a little time, I have become a formal magic apprentice yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Exhaust sounds came out from other magic apprentices, and Sprint was able to become an official magic apprentice so quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom was quite surprised: "It’s a genius. And Sprint you are very enthusiastic, I see you have been guiding them a few arcanes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, we are all companions." After Sprint was praised, the child replied happily, then he saw the road around Tom. Sean, with a good intention, said, "Mr. Tom, is this a new companion? He looks a little older, don't know if he is a formal magic apprentice or a high-level magic apprentice? Hehe, do you know about arcane? If you don't understand, you can ask me." He said to Lucien later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina also stood up, she wore a white dress, bright and beautiful, green and bright, and matured at the age of fourteen, will wash the board Like Lei Liiya and Heidi, two beautiful girls of the same age are like children: "I can also guide you to arcane problems, and I can become an official magic apprentice in a few days!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her heart, it seems that the young Lucian, who is around twenty years old, is at most a high-level magic apprentice, and should have never touched the arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magic apprentices did not say anything, quietly watching the two most outstanding companions continue the competition of this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom smirked at Lucien: "This is Mr. Evans, a formal magician."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Official Wizard?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So young?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Different exclaimers are sent out from these young boys and girls, although the description they saw in the ancient magic books is "a young man with unusual spiritual talent, who can become a formal magic after the 18-year-old thinking matures and the soul is stable." division". But the status of the official magician is so high, the advancement must be quite difficult. It is hard to imagine a magician who is so young and so young. Perhaps he used magic to keep his appearance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
