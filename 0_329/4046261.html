			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Windy Moon (August). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s in Aringe or Aalto, this time is already hot and the air seems to be able to burn, but in this bustling, buildings seem to be gathering In the chaotic and narrow cities of many countries in the mainland, the cool breeze is still boasting, like the spring of March. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the valley in the northwest of the "Northland", surrounded by countless giant trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the north of the city along the stormy straits is controlled by the magic parliament "Parmela's cabin", and their strength goes deep into the north, sweeping a lot Monsters, dwarf tribes and trolls and other monsters have established many cities, so in most people's minds, the North is the territory of the "Parmela's Cabin" organization, which is the natural control zone of the Magic Council. "Northland" west to the northwestern province of Shahran Empire, east to the "unfrozen port" Mintak at the northern end of the endless oceanic estuary, south to the Shahran Empire Northern Flame Fortress and Stormwind Strait, north to the perennial knot The ice does not change, the darkness of the half-year darkness for half a year, the vastness of the vast expanse, far exceeds the largest empire of Shahran, the magic parliament and Palmera's hut can only control the southeast, and the depths are horrible trolls, Orcs, snowmen, and ancient magicians who lived in seclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a special location in the valley, at the junction of the northern coastal core and the vast virgin forests of the northeast of the Shahran Empire, due to the confrontation between the Northern Church and the Magic Council. And it is difficult for each other to go deep into here, so it has become a no-branch zone. Many exiles and criminals from the Shahran Empire are slowly gathering here. The Valley of the Valley and many manors are established in the valley. East exile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unruly or cruel and vicious guys fight smuggling trade while fighting monsters such as trolls, although initially established a crude law, but the surface is covered up It is full of danger. "The law of sword and magic is the rule of the North!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but because of its monopoly on the smuggling trade of the Northland and Shahran Empire Therefore, there are still countless merchants and adventurers who are eager for money, and they are very prosperous regardless of the danger. Of course, most of the merchants have recruited good men or mercenaries, otherwise they will be killed and thrown into the forest to feed the beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien leisurely strolls on the streets of Thur Valley Cross, the goal is the ancient pine hut in front, according to the information of the Magic Council, it is a relatively famous intelligence organization in Segu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, wearing a white shirt, black double-breasted long dress, with a top hat and a monocle, because of his youth, looks handsome, not enough Deterrence, so in the eyes of the inhabitants of the East, he was a delicious and delicious fat. After many people around him looked up and down, wondering how to create opportunities to kidnap him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is understated and luxurious, and he must have a lot of treasures. Hey, even if it is a poor man, he can be trained to sell to Shahran after his appearance and temperament. The noble ladies or nobles of the empire are secret lover." Two big men with obvious barbaric bloodlines passed by and communicated with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look again, dare to go alone to the east, you must be somewhat emboldened, don't just look at the outside. Because of contempt for the elderly, children, women, thin and young There are still fewer guys who die because of people?" Another big man replied in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These criminals who are unrepentant and ruthless can live to the present, and most of them have developed a cautious surname, but as long as the other party is not enough The strength, they will show the most despicable and most unscrupulous side of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien leaves, not only converts 2,200 advance arcane points into magic potions, casting materials, gold, and "magic "The shack", and also got a bottle of strange potion called "blood scavenger" from the will of the element, making up for the potential trauma of taking "cry soul", from the strength of the quasi-knight to the level of the official knight, so even if not Inspired by mental energy, the ear also directly heard the dialogue between the two big men. Not only did the smile shake his head: "It’s not the East Exile..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Magic Council The study on the blood vessels of the pharmacy ends here, because the more you go up, the greater the will based on your own knight's creed. If Lucien is assisted by regular pharmacy in Aringe, there is hope that he will become a second-class knight like the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, but Lucien himself will be mobilized by the ancient pharmacy to become a formal knight. The effect of the agent is remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A right-handed man standing next to the gate stretched out his right hand and stopped Lu Xien, who was about to walk in. The rough voice was full of ridicule: "This is not a place where children can come."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he is bulging his right hand bronze muscles, showing his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled angrily: "What talent can come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;彪The big man snorted and pointed to the motto engraved on the door, without speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the side of the camellia, the words "either money or power" are engraved with the words of Shahran and the common language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and nodded: "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big man Suddenly I felt that the young man in front of him was the most admired and feared object in his heart. It seemed that he was the strong man who supported the East and the exile. So he bent like a longbow and smiled and said: "Mr. Dear, please. Come in, please come in, just my mouth is not clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his own slap in the face, and took the road in the eyes of his companions Sean walked inside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tony, he, is he possessed by ghosts?!" The cool breeze of Thurgu in August blew, and his companions couldn’t help but fight. A chill, the reality of the front and back is different. "Is it a formal magician? But I have not sensed the magical fluctuations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hesitated For a while, the big man quickly turned and ran to the ancient pine lodge to inform the host about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffickers who followed Lucien came over and swallowed hard. If they just rushed out, would they be like Tony? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has "controlled" Tony without magical fluctuations, which is not something ordinary magicians can do! Even the ancient high-level magicians hidden behind the East and the Exiles seem to be difficult! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fascinating human (Knight Edition) after Lucien's improvement, and it is known for its magical fluctuations, and the three-ring magician casts a ring of magic and a magical cast. A ring of magic, in the control, power and the difference between the mountains of heaven and the abyss, these even the official knight level no guy to take what to sense the tiny magic fluctuations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The ancient pine cabin is divided into a number of hidden compartments, each with different people buying and selling information, the environment is very elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony took Lucien straight to the stairs, where he was guarded by two muscular men with long swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tony, what is this gentleman?" The cold sword was in front of Tony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony squatted his back and pointed his finger at Wayne: "This is an important guest of Mr. Gusson. You let it go." Lucien stood. Behind him, his mouth was smiling and he said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the sword wondered: "How did I not hear Mr. Gusson say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go and report Mr. Gusson first." Another man did not care, turned and went upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just turned around, Tony suddenly rushed up, his right hand clenched his fist and slammed directly into the man's temple holding the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword man was caught off guard, his ears glimpsed, his eyes were black, and he passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man on the stairs was just about to turn and slashed to Tony, his head suddenly dizzy, his smile filled with horses and his face: "Mr. Dear Sir, It is too rude to take a sword to block you! We have already taught him awkwardly, please forgive me, I will lead you to Mr. Gusong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien pushed the single glasses and followed them without speaking. In my heart, "With my current mental power, it seems that human beings can only control three people at the same time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony knocked down the companion who was chased by the man who took the sword, and shouted: "Mr. Gusson, someone attacked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
