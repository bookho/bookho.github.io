			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cave is dark and narrow, and it seems to be no different from the ordinary cave. The corner can also see the beasts of the beasts, etc., but Lucian goes deep into the cave along the small intestines. Later, I found that there were more and more roads, and they were like a spider web. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving the crystal ball from the storage bag, Lucien rubbed its surface, combined with the information provided by Rhein, simply performed astrology, probably judged Which road should be chosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step into a slanting down road, Lucien walked for a few tens of meters, saw the new road, and found a pile of descriptions of Rhine Strange dark black coal ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a palm, a signpost that is specially reserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the places to go are the dark mountains, the polluted waters of the endless oceans, the southern desert of the Gusta Empire, and the sacred empire capital of Antwerp. Covering the north and south of the entire continent, even if Lucien learned advanced flight, in the case of careful care, concealment and rest, the task is very compact within one year, so Rhein provides a different vampire control. The space allows the road to jump, which can greatly save the road time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the heterogeneous space and the main material world is completely different from the appearance of many small bubbles on a large bubble imagined by ordinary magicians, because the form of space exists. The limits of imagination that are limited by experience, body and soul have been exceeded and can only be determined by the description of the formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These different spaces are connected to the main material world by many "space nodes". Although the area itself is much smaller than the main world, the coordinates of the "space nodes" Maybe one in the dark mountains, one in the sky city of Aringe, the distance between the two in the heterogeneous space may be only one hundredth, one thousandth, or even one ten thousandth of the distance of the main material world, so with the help of A door jump that is placed on a space node is a great way to get on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the heterogeneous space is very dangerous or like a labyrinth, the time spent inside it will rise linearly, and due to the barrier of the space barrier, it is impossible to interact with the main substance. World relations. For example, “Elemental Dominator” Hathaway once explored a heterogeneous space called the “Erks Labyrinth” and tried to find its chaotic sea boundary. As a result, it wasted a whole decade and could not find the exit node. In the end, I had to rely on the connection between the legendary magician and my own plane, forcing “space drifting” and it took five years to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien is quite confused and vigilant about the existence of the world of the dead, it is almost the chaotic reflection of the main material world, there is no space node, but everywhere Mixed together, connected by cracks that are strangely difficult to sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives way to the feeling that the soul of the world is the dark side of the main material world, plus the fact that the magician such as Maskillin is trapped inside and himself The natural fear of undead, the heart is often worried that one day it will endanger the main material world and endanger its own life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, after knowing the changes in the depths of the Necromancers from the mouth of the Rhine, Lucien, despite doubts, chose to remain vigilant. With the promise of the first, I decided to try, but if the difficulty of the matter is indeed beyond the scope of my ability, I will certainly not hesitate to return, choose to risk the highest rating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering the first unobtrusive road sign, Lucien’s speed to the depths of the underground is faster and faster, and the choice of the road is not Need help with prophetic magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien didn’t take up the crystal ball, but let it float in front of him, his hands rubbing five times on the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball is getting brighter and more transparent, and suddenly it turns from black to black, "spit out" a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is only the size of the thumb, the black one, the straps are deep wrinkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed his hand, this strange thing flew up, and Huo Di cracked a gap in the middle, quickly widened, and appeared pale and covered with black fine The pupil of the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange eye blurs and splits into nine equals, then hides the figure and flies back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magical "Peeping Eyes" of the five-ring star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien once again showed himself a four-ring star-like magic "detecting danger", alerting for malicious and snooping within 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the situation observed by the magic eye, Lucien carefully moved toward the bottom of the earth, according to the Rhine, hiding the space node and the door of the alien world. There are many monsters in the dwarf ruins, such as underground hunters, such as the dwarf ghosts that can't dissipate after death, such as the twisted nest mother and the countless fallen monsters she made, even if there are no high-order creatures, under the raid, it may still threaten To yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ A swaying road swayed Angus's eyes, and it’s already felt in this dark, damp, depressed cave passage. Not the smell of Lucien, let alone his figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with the traces, Lucien was the true biography of Natasha, the Knight of Heaven, and Angus did not dare to get too close. So in the ordinary sense, it has already lost Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a red flame jumping on the rotten face, Angus was not confused, and a silent spell was heard in the mouth, and it began to use the magical prediction of the star system. The location of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many roads, Angus is very certain that the straight-line distance between the two is no more than one kilometer. In the case of such a close distance, the prophetic magic is Quite precise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Astral coordinates (159, 260); Lucien is in this position, four hundred meters away from me." According to the position of Lucien, Angus I chose the martyrdom and proceeded cautiously. Once I encountered a dead end, it turned into a spirit or hidden into the realm of the dead, passing through the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no uniform standard for astrological coordinates. The high-level undead is significantly different from the magical parliament. In particular, the magic they perform is a natural instinct. Will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously passed through more than a dozen mountain walls, and it is necessary to catch up with Lucien. Angus evokes himself: "You can't enter him thirty." Within the range of meters, otherwise it will be sensed by the ninth-level magical items. After determining his destination, he will steal and kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ... With the path and warning of "Peeping the Eyes of the Eyes", when a sly demon monster was thrown out, Lucien did not appear any surprise, the simplest and fastest magic missiles condensed, and a silver-black track was drawn. Kill them all at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are these normal devils with a normal human body, with a dwarf look, with a curved horn on the head, and a black solidified body. "Arms", the right hand white bones are exposed, there are giant axe, there are also long swords, the left hand is holding the same black "shield". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They often rush out in groups of three, and the roar is so wicked that it can make people feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the four fallen monsters, Lucien looked at the disgusting solidified liquid in them, considering that his storage bag was full, so he gave up The materials continue to be vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, Lucien suddenly felt a burning spurt on the chest. It has unlocked the three-layer seal and is becoming more sensitive to the undead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The powerful atmosphere of the dead, the linear distance is less than 25 meters?" Lucien slightly felt that the breath was wearing "respect" The wall crossed the wall and chased itself. "Is it the killing of the high-order undead in the dead world? Is Mr. Rhein’s plan detected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capricorn ring, road Sean is ready, ......... "There is still a distance of 60 meters from Lucien. You must be careful. There are so many powerful magic items on his body. If you find it in advance, you will be in a bad fight." Angus is at The pale hand also stayed for a year or two. It is probably known that Lucien received a lot of seven magic items due to the contribution of the Arcane research, and he also had the talisman made by Maskillin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the dead spirit, through the black and white gray rock wall, Angus to another ramp, just as he hides his body and drills the space barrier When I was ready to confirm the location of Lucien, I suddenly saw the end of the road. Lucien, wearing a black double-breasted long dress, turned out from the shelter and smiled at herself, with a faint ray on her hand. I expected it to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
