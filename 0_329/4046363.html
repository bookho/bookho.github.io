			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council headquarters, the fifteenth floor, in a grand and bright office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich and exotic dark yellow carpet is soft and comfortable to step on; the magic crystal chandelier on the ceiling is fascinating even if it is not lit; the dark red desk is painted Inscribed with a complex magical array, it seems that it is not ordinary wood; behind the bar at the corner of the room, there is a drink for entertaining guests and a drink such as "Sky Blue" that you enjoy... This is Lucien becoming the fifth arcane review committee. After the 14 members of the committee, the papers to be reviewed will be distributed from the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not in the office, the papers will be sorted and sorted out, and will be sent to my home every evening. If I go out for a long time, the paper will be handed over to me. The teacher storm dominated the Lord." Lucien told the normal-sized steel golem in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The papers that need to be reviewed by themselves are not dare to be assigned. They are all "bombs" with subversive surnames. They can only work harder, but this There may be no papers in a few years, and you don’t have to worry about your own efforts to hit high-level ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel magic eyes flashed red, and replied with a cold, metal-filled voice: "Yes, master."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become an audit committee member, in addition to getting an exclusive office, you can also receive a magic servant in the exchange area, there are secret puppets, gas servants, elemental life, and various magic images, but the level is not high. Order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some "careful" selection, Lucien chose the most expensive "812 edition" steel golem, which is said to be within a certain range of strong magnetic fields. Can also maintain a few minutes of combat ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not speak again, sorted out the collar and stepped out of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the aisle, Lucien met several middle and low level arcans who worked on the audit committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they saw Lucien’s appearance and the badge of the “one-handed feather pen” on the chest, they all respectfully performed the mage: “Mystery is on the top.” "Evans committee member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, hard work everyone." Lucien gently squeezed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stepping into the hall, the Jingjin Golem of the Gatekeeper also said in a low-pitched voice: "Go well, respected Evans Commissioner."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legend can compete against the Golden Knight? Lucien looked slightly up and down and looked at the Golden Golem, so I wanted to move home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if there are not many parliaments, they can only be at the entrance of the three major committees, the higher arcane and magical libraries, the material warehouse, the higher restraint, The highest ranking group has one or two guards in each of the places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the high-level Mithril Golem is not the current financial power of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Aringe" Magic Tower, the thirty-third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went to the teacher's study room as usual to receive a study task, listening to harsh picks and guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the storm, there is a soup with gold-rimmed glasses, and a small dog like a puppy at the foot of Fernando. Avery, who is sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tang spectrum, your essay, etc., I have something to do with the road." Fernando put down his paper and looked up at Lucien. "The soul you have developed has the potential to be solid, you can change the idea of ​​better meditation. And your mental strength is five rings. It is not very good to use ordinary intermediate meditation. I have a kind of myself here. The improved meditation idea is more suitable for the high-order of the five-ring impact. Even if it is promoted to the sixth ring, it is not worse than other high-order meditation ideas. It is enough to use the eight rings. Do you want to learn?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think? Lucien thinks that his teacher is simply asking this question. Can such a good thing be postponed? And after you have fully adapted to the initial substantive world of cognition, even if the storm dominates, don't give it to the "High Arcane and Magic Library". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the answer from Lucien, Fernando came up with a black quaint book that had been prepared for a long time: "My meditation is very good, but it is most suitable for my own meditation, waiting for you to understand the world. After substantialization, you can combine several advanced meditation ideas and your own understanding of mental strength and soul. If you can create a kind of meditation idea that is suitable for you and fits the essence of spiritual power in high-level, then You will be more hopeful than others to enter the legendary field in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improving meditation is a dangerous and arduous thing, in the cognitive world. It's best not to try before, otherwise you can easily climb the first stupid Ariel's most stupid way to death, and all the magicians laugh at your IQ, I don't want my students to be synonymous with idiots." Fernando is like a ruby The eyes looked at Lucien sternly. "Even if the cognitive world has been initially substantive, you should be careful too, so that nothing will be left without a bang, remember?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, teacher." Lucien did not dare to tell the teacher that he knew that the world had been initially substantive. He decided to talk about it for two or three years, to avoid being suspected by him, and to be thankful that he had a lot of things and had not The direction turns to the idea of ​​meditation - the cognitive world can be initially substantive, not only because it proposes that the energy is discontinuous, but also because the two world cosmological constants bring to themselves the impact, making the cognitive world heavy Plastic. This is his biggest secret, and it is difficult to explain it with other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the quaint books, Lu Xien was a glimpse, because the cover directly said "Fernando's meditation", the teacher's name is really rude and direct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, within three years, it is best not to leave Aringe, if you really need to leave, be sure to remember to report to me or the Panel. You are now However, the purification of the 53rd place of the 'original devil', the first person below the legend, I do not know how many night watchers, cardinals, paladins frantically want to kill you, even if Feili Bell, Baha'u'llah personally, I I don't feel surprised." Next to the committee member Tang Pei reminded Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded, being stared at by the church is like being bitten by a mad dog, even if Felipe is so arrogant, more than two years Stay quiet in Heidler or Allinge to improve your magical power. However, after two or three years, the storm subsided, as the strongest force in the whole world, and some things distracted the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that throwing the miracle experiment together is based on this, lest the church’s attention shifts almost, and another thing that stimulates them, now only needs After two or three years, An An has raised his level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't Lentaut go?" Lucien suddenly thought that he would be a high-level element and should go to the meeting often. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando simply waved his hand: "Let them come to Allinge, it's not good, you use Hathaway's half-face to do the transfer directly to Huo The Royal Magic Tower of Erm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When Lucien accepted the instructions to leave, the soup looked at his back and sighed two words: "Road Sean will soon get two Holm crown rings, and maybe there is an immortal throne. I am an eight-ring magician, and the highest honor is like a rainbow in the sky, only to appreciate the inability to touch."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afris’s ear that was asleep was suddenly moving, as if he had heard the unbearable temptation in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are no other accidents, a snow medal is indispensable." Fernando seems to want to stimulate students who like to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphras sneaked openly, and the slightly transparent amber pupil reflected a beautiful gemstone ring and talisman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum reluctantly smiled: "Before becoming a high-end, Lucien may be able to get the highest honor in three different magic fields, but there is These awards have only happened four or five times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is hard to think of electrons from the phenomenon of gas discharge." Fernando suddenly Talking about the irrelevant words, the soup spectrum is quite doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando said it himself: "Brook noticed this and ventured into the lightning cloud. He finally verified it with a clear purpose. E-commerce is one of the causes of natural lightning. That is to say, if the Song of the Silver Moon is a little more generous, there is no problem for Lucien's Silvermoon Medal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
