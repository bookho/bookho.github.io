			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the scroll, Lucien’s mood gradually precipitated, and asked curiously: “Teacher, you always said that you did a lot of ridiculous things when you were young. What are the ridiculous things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words, Fernando’s eyes screamed, “Do not inquire about things that should not be inquired! Go back and analyze” Spell triggering!! Don't think that you can raise the ranks with a ritual!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden roar scared Lucien and jumped out of the door. When the door was closed and the sound was cut off, Lucien laughed and puzzled and shook his head: "The absurd thing the teacher did is really ridiculous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............ Five days later, the Magic Council headquarters, the thirty-third floor, an empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floor of the hall is mixed with the blood of the banshee and other precious materials to engrave a body-like magical array of heads, left chest, palms and feet. The position is full of spell lines, like a beating dark red heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's lie on the magical array." Felipe laid out the basic magical array before letting Lucien and the storm dominate, lest they steal the special The soul ritual "Blessing of the Banshee". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien removes the Holm Crown Ring, Ice and Snow Avenger Ring, Ogre Gloves, Take off the Immortal Throne Robe, Dodge Boots, Pick The shackles of the squats, the bracelets of the weavers, the arcane badges, and the magic badges are handed to the Afflecks of the "Hidden" that are next to each other. This soul ritual must not interfere with any magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afrith temporarily acts as a coolie but does not feel trouble, amber eyes crystallize at the ornaments in his hand, from time to time with his tongue licking the ring, talisman Wait, there is no attention to the conduct of the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien in a white shirt and stovepipe pants slowly walked to the magic array, lying down in a fixed position, and Felipe took six The huge bones of the high-end banshee teeth refining, the tone is very bad: "Do not cry out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he picked up one The bones engraved with complex and strange patterns are tied to the back of Lucien's right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing that doesn’t know what material it contains is so sharp that it directly pierces the body of the second-class knight of Lucien and nails the magic below. In the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although psychologically prepared, Lucien still licked his lower teeth, pain is an unavoidable reaction, but fortunately the painful injury has also been experienced, not too big Shouting out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of light flashes the blood of the radiant silver moon, and the banshee bones are reddish, but the color quickly fades until it disappears. It seems to be completely absorbed by the bone nails, slowly infused into the lines of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand, the right ankle, and the left ankle were all plunged into the nail, and Felipe gently ties the remaining two to the center and heart of Lucian's forehead. They entered shallowly, almost piercing the epidermis, but as if they had a mysterious connection with the magical array behind Lucien, they stood up like that, and it seemed to pierce the road and heart of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Felipe stepped back a few steps and gently chanted the mantra, and the roots of the magic line slowly lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell is gentle, like a singing voice, the power of sleep is infiltrated from the bone nails and from the magical array, letting Lucien's eyelids sink, and the thoughts involuntarily diverge. I remembered that I have fully analyzed the "spell trigger" that I have completed most of the past few days. I think of the structure and materials of the "improved" magic crystal lamp, and gave it to Arthur and Florence. Professional identification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind from the place of sleeping, please blow through this helpless soul, never stop blowing." Felipe lifted his own inlay The black magic wand with a variety of gems reads the mantra in the language of the dead spirit created by the Mesquite Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large, light white gemstone on the magic wand shines, Felipe's windbreaker floats like a bat's wings, as if there is a burst of The light wind of decaying taste blew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien feels the breath of the wind, a burst of hypnotic sound comes with the wind, the soul is more wandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it look, there is a pale, invisible illusory flame on the magical array. They did not cause any damage to Lucien's body, but let Lucien feel the warmth and the soul became more and more pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers of Fernando’s red eyes are half-closed and seem to see a monster with a sickle and black robes through the illusory pale flame, and behind it. Wandering the wilderness of countless undead creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coldness from Silent Hell, please surround this helpless soul, let him get eternal silence." Felipe re-circles three points In one circle, a silver jewel illuminates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless cold silence wraps the soul of Lucien and makes it more solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Felipe raised his left hand and made a silent scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six bones filled with the blood of Lucien are twisted like snakes, and they rise to the shadow of illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beautiful but distorted female illusion. Their upper body is white and naked, and their expressions are painful and uneasy. They can be driven by Felipe’s screams. Open your mouth and sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song is beautiful, the melody is beautiful, but only the soul can hear it. Lucien vaguely sees his soul appearing strangely in the song. , slowly absorb the liquid flowing inside the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, Felipe had a cold sweat on his forehead, his left hand put it down, and took out a strange all-black mirror from his arms, which was not only dotted with small magic stones. There are also scarlet "leaves", pale, empty eyes, and behind the blind banshee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror was thrown by Felipe, and there was no place to float on the head of Lucien, and the whole black could not be photographed by the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrowful narrative spell spit out from Felipe's mouth, all the gems on the magic wand shine, attracting Aphrodite's attention. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror trembled softly, the singing of the six banshee phantom became crying, the pain was extremely, and the black mirror slowly split, revealing white Empty eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pupil, a black twisted figure seems to be dancing a strange dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this eccentric eye, Lu Xien suddenly felt that the fluttering soul suddenly rose, drifting across the clouds, drifting through the stars, and The star of my own destiny meets, and then I feel that there is something in the endless distance that cannot be touched. It seems that something is in direct contact with my soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is "looking over" yourself with a high-spirited attitude! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines of the magic array suddenly jumped like alive, and then all curled up and wrapped around Lucien’s body and immersed deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of Lucien was slammed back to his body, trembled seven times, and was completely awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My promise has been completed, I don't owe you anything." Felipe took out a white handkerchief and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, leaving his face gloomy. In a word, he turned and left without turning back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s head is slightly dizzy, a little unable to adapt to the state of the soul, wait a few minutes, the spirit moves, the nails on the palm of the hand float on their own, Turned into a little powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mental strength and soul can already interfere with reality..." Lucian confirmed with a little emotion that his speed from the middle to the high level is probably a history of the Magic Council. The fastest one since the beginning, but it was exchanged for the promotion speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone nails are broken and turned into powder. Lucien stood up like no creation, and the magical array carved on the floor has completely disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does the last eye represent?" The storm dominated Fernando whispering doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a great arcane master who sees the essence directly through fancy and complicated magic rituals, such as the power borrowed from the front, he knows very well, but the last step is It is not clear what is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
