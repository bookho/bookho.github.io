			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small looked at the mysterious magician who was covered in a black robe and looked at the shadow of the hood covering his entire lower half. Suddenly, I felt that the other party couldn’t tell the coldness and the evil. The deep horror seemed to be the abyss that could not see the end. It gave me a lot of pressure, if I didn’t know that it was necessary under the control of the church, Smai Er may think that the other is a black magician who specializes in taboo magic in ancient magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing the "Avenue of the Snow and the Avenger", Lucien found that the constant flow of cold into his body, so that his soul is as clear as ice, Cold, the will is like a mountain, and it can't move. The ordinary apprentice-level magic that acts on the soul, the will, or the spirit and the mind will not have any effect. And this will can follow the official knight's eruption and slightly show it out. Used to shock others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly walked into the room and closed the door, then it was like returning to his home, in the eyes of Smyr’s alert, I randomly found a stool and sat down. It seemed that I didn't put Smyr in my eyes. After I sat down, Lucien answered with a deliberately distorted voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I happened to know the witch a few weeks ago, and through her know that there is a magician from the mainland Magic Council headquarters in Aalto, I am looking forward to it, so I made an appointment and I am ready to meet. That magician. You should be able to understand, how much it is to hide and hide, and to be afraid of being discovered by the church. I really want to go where the magician can freely learn magic. Unfortunately, before the appointed time, the witch Was burned to death by the church, because I was worried that the church was secretly monitoring the ruins of the witch, so I just observed it in secret, and prepared to wait for some time before I went to ask the young man named Lucien, and it happened to meet you. Owl Doro."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether Smyr asked himself whether it was a formal magician, Lucien was not sure, nor denied, as if he had never heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that for this secret gathering of magic apprentices, the witch feels normal, plus does not get the news and materials that she wants, so there is no magic Recorded in the notes, after all, it is based on recording their own learning magic experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to the answer from Lucien, Smyr’s long sigh of relief, because of the same encounter, the same mood, the same magician’s identity, Both of them make the relationship between the two sides close. The magic apprentices and magicians in Aalto are like small people who are struggling to survive in a desperate situation. Once they find the same kind, they always think about uniting together, and a formal magician, Really want to kill yourself, robbing his belongings and the like, just started directly, how can you defend against formal magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He considered the language and hurriedly said: "Mr. Magician, as you can see, I have known the witch for several months and invited her to join us. Holding some hidden apprentices of magic apprentices, nearly a month ago, she suddenly told us that she met an eccentric, formal magician and wanted to get further contact. If the other person can trust, she will join us and soon she will I am very pleased to tell us that the other is a formal magician from the headquarters of the Magic Council of the Continent, where you can learn magic in a bright and free way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this matter Our magic apprentices are very excited and let the witch invite each other to join us. Mr. Magician, we also hate hiding and hiding, can be found by the church at any time, and want to go to the mainland magic through this magician. Parliament headquarters. However, because the other party had a delay, the first time it failed to participate, it was only commissioned by the witch to send an "Arcane" journal, which was the first issue of twenty-five years ago. In this journal, we all believe that there is really a mainland magic parliament, because the above content is something we can't imagine, and even many can't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the second meeting of our appointment has not yet arrived, it is the news that the witch was burned, because only I know the witch, so I confirmed that the church did not doubt me, I rushed from the purple lily area. I lived in the Copper Crown Tavern, which is convenient for close-up observation and searching for the news that the witch may have left, and the whereabouts of the official magician. Similarly, because I was worried about the church’s secret surveillance, I waited for so many days before I started to act." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Smyr’s expression and saw that his excitement, shock, surprise, disappointment, regret and other emotions were very real, said It is also very logical, probably affirming the content of his words, the heart is slightly disappointed, I thought I would hear about the mainland magic council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calming down, Lucien slowly said: "It’s a pity, maybe the witch was caught by the church when she met the magician. A magic apprentice, a formal magician from the Magic Council headquarters can draw the attention and attention of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl Doro said noisyly: "This is really a tragedy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the "Arcane" journal you just said is Where can I show it?" Lucien asked another important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small smiled bitterly: "Mr. Magician, let you down, this journal we are taking turns collecting, now not in my hands, huh, above Many articles, every word I know, can be connected together, I don't understand what it means, maybe only you can be understood by a formal magician. If you don't mind, it is better to attend our secret meeting. You can see it when you see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing something, the official magician has no dangerous moves under the pressure of strong power. Smyr thinks that he can be trusted, not the evil magician with a bad name and bad purpose, so he boldly invites Lucien to participate in a secret meeting on his side, if he can go to the magician. Mr. asks, some of the problems in his own magic may be able to get a perfect solution, so that his strength grows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment and thought that there was a "Ice and Snow Vengeance" ring on the body, he had a certain self-protection strength, and with other magicians, magic Apprentice communication is very helpful for the study of their own magic. In addition, under the control of the church, magic apprentices and magicians have a natural sense of closeness. Therefore, Lucien thinks it is necessary to take some risks to see. Then he asked: "What do you do in this secret gathering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the mysterious magician's tone loose, Smyr excitedly up and explained: “Because Aalto was the last core of the ancient Ilvanas magical empire, there are many magicians reclusive in this place. They secretly teach apprentices to maintain the inheritance of their magic, and because of this reputation, the Vaurit duchy Apprentices who occasionally get magical inheritance often come to find all kinds of key magical materials, seek directions, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But under the control of the church, every Magician, magic It was difficult for the disciples to meet each other at first. Later, they gradually came across the materials and adventures nearby, leaving a secret way of connecting with each other. So in Aalto, different magical circles were formed because of various accidental relationships. Each circle often holds secret gatherings to exchange magical materials, discuss magical puzzles, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our magic apprentice circle was seven or eight years ago, Several magic apprentices were accidentally met during the adventures of the Melzer Black Forest. A secret meeting was held every two weeks. After that, the first few magic apprentices continued to trust others they encountered. The magic apprentices come in, because the more people, the easier it is to find the materials, magic, magic arrays, magic potions, etc. that they need, and they can better discuss the magic problem. Well, when you meet, you will dress like a magician. In addition to introducing the incoming people, they don’t know each other, they don’t know each other’s identity, and they don’t know if there are other magic circles behind them.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are a magician, you can join us in this circle, I believe that with your strength, one can become the core of this circle, I am willing to introduce and guarantee for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a hidden gathering, Smyr has also seen apprentice-level magic items, even the official magic items that others get when they are passed on, so after the initial panic and excitement, He began to have some doubts about the true strength of the black robe mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party can easily track the devil Doro, without any movement to find himself, or let Smyr decide to treat him as a formal magician. At the party, it is not too late to judge through magic problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is always the best standard for judging the strength of a magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requires magical materials, magic potions, etc., and the "Arcane" journal, which made Lucien firmly determined to participate in this secret apprentice gathering: "What are you?" When is the party, where is it? My magic lab was destroyed not long ago and I need a complete set of magic lab utensils. If I can prepare in advance, I will be happy to participate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small laughed: "This Saturday night, we will have a party, specifically where the sewer is, have not decided yet, please ask the magician to give me the way to contact me. After the confirmation of the fifth night, I will contact you directly." He tried to make his smile kind and sincere, but the hook nose and gloomy temperament slightly damaged the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
