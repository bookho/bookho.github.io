			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last night's things set off such a big wave? The church used this kind of carpet-style investigation? No, it should be that I used to have contact with the witch, so It was listed on the suspect list, but it was not the top priority. Otherwise, it would not be until the afternoon. Someone found it.” Lucian didn’t panic, calmly thought, and quietly said the excuse: “I finished last night. The last part of the music didn't sleep until very late, and it seemed to overdraw the energy, so I was very tired in the morning and thought I was ill, but by noon I had completely recovered and should only be over-consumed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucien let the church people check their physical condition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa continues to ask: "Can someone prove that it is a disease? If not, please go back to the church with me to do an inspection."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already said it, just because of the exhaustion caused by the music, not sick." Lucien still answered calmly. At this time, Victor stepped forward: "Mr. guard, I can prove that my student Lucian was writing scores last night and caused him." The morning is exhausted because he has written a great and great work. Whenever I can finish a satisfactory work, there is always a kind of exhaustion from the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa looked at Victor and said, "Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the musician Mr. Victor, the teacher of Lucien Elena was somewhat scared to introduce, and looked at Lucien very strangely. "He? Write music?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And also got Victor Mr. Such a high evaluation! Is Mr. Victor saying this in order to deal with the church guards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa took out the quill and recorded it on a black booklet What is it: "Mr. Victor, you are a teacher of Lucien, so your proof will not be fully adopted, and there are other witnesses. If not, trouble Lu Xien, you will go back to the church with me once, not by the referee, but to check the condition of your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi The appearance was calm, but my mind was thinking about how to get rid of it, so the scene became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can prove that he really did a great work, and that he is an excellent piece of music that fights evil and fights hard, I think he is writing When you are music, you must have burned your soul and all your enthusiasm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the director of the Musicians Association, Baron Othello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello heard the movement in the office and walked out to testify for Lucien. On the one hand, although he hated that music, he had a musical talent and might pay for Lucien. The effort is affirmative. His words will not be fake. If there is no exhaustion after completing the work, Othello will doubt Lu Xien. On the other hand, Othello does not want to disturb the Victor concert that he has already begun to look forward to. And he also wants to maintain the decent appearance of the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa's slightly jaw, once again recorded a line of words on the booklet: "The Baron, have your testimony, I think I can leave." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Correa himself will never believe that Lucien is the "professor" wanted, according to the information given by the referee, Lucien three months When I was interrogated, I was still an ordinary person, and the mysterious "professor" was a powerful, at least three-ring magician. It is absolutely impossible for him to grow to this extent in only three months, even if he is a soul. It can't be sold to the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee and the bishop are judged this way, so in the first round of the morning review, Lucien was not placed on the list, and in the afternoon, Correa saw that Lucien had a very small suspicion, and then he had the idea of ​​bringing him back and letting him suffer. This is to cut off the hope of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that there is a baron proof, Correa will not force him to offend the aristocrats who will be members of the Knights who have not yet become temples. Very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Correa and turning away, Lucien finally breathed a sigh of relief, and his body would be found to be injured rather than sick as soon as he was examined. And tired, fortunately, I have the proof of Baron Othello and Mr. Victor, this symphony of fate, the biggest gain of his own is this aspect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena looked at the beautiful and beautiful eyes of the green, like a stranger, and looked at Lucien: "I didn't get it wrong, Othello's director even said that Lucien wrote a great work?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is Victor, she doesn’t dare to ask Lucien directly, but she is curious like a living rabbit, she keeps jumping in her heart. Let her reluctant to leave the place and return to the lobby on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the arrival of Correa, the entire third floor was alarmed, and Wolfe saw Victor at the door of Othello’s director, and came over doubtfully. "What happened just now? Why are you here at Victor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, it's okay anyway." Victor shook his head. "I come. Here is the request for the replacement of the track by the Othello director."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be practice here every day, even if you don’t let others listen, the band’s people will not be kept secret. So Victor said it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf face becomes ugly: "Do you connect your own melody and inspiration to write a new piece of music?" It is impossible to believe that Victor will suddenly have inspiration, and then there will be new music in a few hours. This kind of thing has at least one or two months of preparation, so it is believed that Victor suddenly has inspiration, will accumulate and prepare before. Connected together, "Is the Othello director promised? Didn't he tell the Princess of the Princess the song?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions that will be Wolff's Urgent and unwilling to fully expose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Othello director has promised that as long as the band's performance meets the requirements, he will be responsible for telling the Princess's changes to His Royal Highness." Victor is not kind enough to be tolerant Wolf, who was full of malice, told Wolfe with a smile that he didn't want to hear the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf shook his head and his voice became slightly sharp: "This is impossible. How can Othello's directors promise such a ridiculous request? The music that came out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor seriously said: "Wolf, unfortunately, the director of Othello has promised, you can go to protest to him, although I don't know if you want What position and reason are used. Well, and this new work is not mine, it is my student Lucian, and you are considered to be a poor person who will never become a musician. On the contrary, his miserable poor life has been given. He created the inspiration and motivation to write such a moving piece of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf laughed out loud and pointed to Lucien next to him: He? Victor, you told me that a poor person who has been learning music for less than three months has written a great piece of music that can be played in the Hall of the Holy Ghost? Is it crazy for you, or is it a fool? Hahaha, if he can Write it out in a short time, then I will honor the oath, from Write music reviews without creating music, if not, then Victor you apologize to me for your lies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf, before you talk, It's best to confirm it first, and when you get to the concert, you can hear it, and when Mr. Joseph will put the score into the library for you to read it." This kind of music that has not been officially performed will not be registered after registration. Go to the library right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When seeing Victor’s serious, serious expression, Wolf’s laughter stopped suddenly, then looked at Lucien next to him: “I think you are crazy. I will play the music written by a beginner to the Hall of the Holy Ghost, waiting to lose all the fame and status, Victor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refuses to admit defeat Rage stunned his head, and before turning around, he said to Lucien: "As long as you are recognized as a good musician, as long as your music is consistently evaluated, I will complete my vows."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wolf’s back disappeared around the corner, Victor couldn’t help but smile: “Pride is prejudiced, prejudice makes people stupid, and stupidity often makes people Bitter, Wolfe is a little smarter. If you first ask Othello and Joseph to confirm, you won’t say this. We have no obligation to stop him from being punished. Well, Lucien, you are mentally exhausted. Go back to a day off and come to the concert tomorrow to help me change Music and help the band practice. I will go to the library to discuss the matter with Mr. Hank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not yet in good condition, really needs rest and Recovery, so there is no sentiment, back to the lounge to take an umbrella, and I went to the first floor lobby with Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
