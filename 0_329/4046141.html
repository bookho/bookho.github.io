			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound, the heavy door of the Dragon Tooth Pub was pushed open and hit the wall, and the noisy and warm atmosphere suddenly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinkers who are red-faced and red-faced, eat the famous rookies in the Longya pub and scream at the adventurers and mercenaries who subconsciously turn their heads to look at the door On the other hand, I found a handsome young man who walked slowly in the blazing sun at noon. He wore a neatly light blue shirt with a gorgeous and beautifully decorated sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp whistle sounded again and again, and the drunken drunks screamed: "What have we seen? A handsome aristocratic young master. He Does the cute toy kill the dead wild dog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another boy who was poisoned by the knight's novel and dared to take the risk with a sword." Although the adventurers and mercenaries are not as unscrupulous as the drunks, they are still careful about the aristocratic teenager. As the middle and lower classes of society, there is an inexplicable embarrassment for the nobility in addition to awe and yearning, especially when it comes to the fact that a waste-like guy can enjoy the high life above by the ancestor's glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien walked over them without hesitation and walked toward the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than three months of good travel, Lucien arrived in the border town of Djibouti, the southern and southern Principality of the mainland, yesterday evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong bald adventurer looked at Lucien, who was not slender but could not be called a thick arm, and lifted his arm that was bare outside the leather armor. The muscles of the elbows are sturdy and sturdy: "I bet that with his poor, thin arms, there isn’t even the strength of the trainee knight. Hey, the imaginary little devil often doesn’t inspire the blood in the adventure like a knight novel. But become the prey of the robbers, wolves or goblins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is the power of the knight so good? I have been through for more than ten years. The adventure is only the strength of the high-ranking knight attendant." A short man who seems to have a dwarf bloodline is quite arrogant and proud to say, "Of course, if he accepts my guidance, there may be hope to stimulate blood. You know, Lord Newell of the City of Ero became a knight after I trained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire of most adventurers here is to stimulate blood Knight, so although I have listened to Chris Hyun Many times, but still could not help but cast envious, longing, desire respect and want to jump test eyes, let it become more happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned a deaf ear to the argument and went to the high stool in front of the pub owner. He was an old, burly old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President guests, what do you need? Fine wine or barbecue?" The pub owner with his white eyes and vicissitudes of his eyes asked politely, not because of Lucien The clothes and temperament that are incompatible here are uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently jaws: "A glass of white water, a barbecue, a salad. Also I want to inquire about something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central and southern parts of the mainland are surrounded by mountains and dense valleys. There are forests everywhere. But unlike other places, there are abundant resources. Only wood and ordinary beasts are the most barren in the whole continent. The most backward places, often a village can not find a person who knows the words. In addition to being in a safe area, there have been no wars in many years. Therefore, even in this country, even if the blood is stimulated, you can only obtain the title of the Cavaliers. You cannot directly obtain the status of the territory and the nobility. You must own the Quinta and purchase it. Sufficient land can be booked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Djibouti, like other countries in the central and southern parts of the continent, the nobility can rely on logging, land and fresh prey to maintain a decent life, and the civilian class is far less Alto, so in addition to the big cities, even the border town of Longya, the adventurer guild is directly in the pub, and according to Lucien's inquiries, the tavern owner is also the local adventurer guild. principal. If you want to get information, it is best to find him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, white water, really pure boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect he still Didn't start long hair, such children dare to venture out to stimulate blood power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunks laughed loudly, but Lucien was unmoved and calm. Looking at the pub owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien used his white water to moisten his lips: "I want to find out where Taylor and Hunter are currently living. He was originally an official of the town of Bonn in the Principality of Vaoliette. He was received by Baron Eric of Djibouti nine years ago. Invited to serve as the officer of his territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor? The Hunters were the parents of Lucy’s little girl who met in the town of Bonn in the spiritual world. They were too sad after their daughter’s disappearance. They chose to accept the invitation of foreign lords and stay away from home. Lucien promised to Going home with the little girl's ashes, I simply re-planned the journey to the Pearl of the Sea. Anyway, I enjoyed the same trip, and Lu Xien also enjoyed the unique flavors of different countries and unique music in different places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner shook his head without hesitation: "This little thing is not within our intelligence. But I personally tell you freely, the affairs of Baron Eric’s territory. The officer is not Mr. Hunter. Maybe he has accepted another invitation. This kind of thing is too common. You can go to the nearest Kuse City Hall to check this record. This is the lord of the Baron Eric, Viscount Stanley. The city, if you still can't find it, you must go to the Baron Eric's territory to inquire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your suggestion, what is worth noting on the mainland recently "Is the news?" Lucien sat in a remote and deep mountain for a 10-day carriage to resist the Longya town. There were only poor villages and scarce roads along the way. There was no place to inquire about the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner smiled and said: "A message, a silver nal, a distinguished guest, do you want to listen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten news, thank you." Lucien directly took out a Quintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden coins make the adventurers and mercenaries stunned, no longer laughing at Lucien, but staring at him intricately, one shot It is a Jintal, a luxury aristocrat who can earn so much in two or three months. Some of the guys are already thinking about whether to temporarily transfer to the robbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbecue came over, Lucien forked and took a bite, and the delicious gravy immediately filled the mouth, not even worse than the Aalto restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner took out a stack of crumpled paper and slowly read: "A three months ago, Aalto, hehe." He looked up slightly strange I took a look at Lucien. "The town of Bonn was attacked by the Necromancer. The most beautiful musician Silvia and his father were victimized. The heroic Knight Natasha tried to kill the evil. The Necromancer, but himself was seriously injured and recuperated in the monastery. It is said that Princess Natasha broke through into a knight in this battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, This is a rare battle that has been rare in the last ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood incineration? No wonder Natasha was able to temporarily suppress it. It turned out to be a real step. Knight," Lucine thought silently. "This matter finally came out after a few months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you become a formal knight, it’s a hurdle. The big knight to the day knight is a more difficult relationship. The great knight has not sublimated because of his life form. Although it has strong resilience and strong strength, it is based on the extreme consumption of the flesh. If it cannot be broken, it will have a shorter life than the ordinary knight. Of course, the strong man with the strength of the great knight is not difficult to get some magical plants, potions, etc., and finally can live to a hundred years old. The Knights of Heaven have broken through the limitations of the mortal body and can live at least two hundred years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next nine pieces of information, probably the friction between the north and the heresy, and several large lords of the Gusta Empire in the south began recruiting mercenaries, seemingly ready to go again The guilty war, as well as an adventurer squad found an ancient ruin on the southern edge of the Dark Mountain, gained a lot of treasure and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the information, after lunch, Lucien wiped his hand with a white handkerchief: "I am going to Coser City, I need to hire a guard and a carriage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucian’s own strength is enough to support him to travel east of the mainland, but with the ability to easily pass the checkpoint, use the money that is not lacking to recruit Bing and other guards seem to be more trouble-free. Lu Xien does not want to waste time on the robbers, goblins and beasts that even the Cavaliers have no strength. It is better to be sent by the mercenaries, and they can quietly analyze and learn other magic in the carriage. When you enjoy life, you naturally need to enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these three months of travel, Lu Xien continued to build five magical rings in the soul, reaching the limit of the current soul strength. Other magical skills can only be temporarily assisted by casting materials and spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
