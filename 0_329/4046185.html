			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get rid of the danger of the attack of the squid, and there is no alarm to the pastor and the knights, these apprentices think that this is the end of the matter, it should not When I encountered other difficulties, who knows that because the damage to the sailboat is serious, the church sent people to check the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the storm was much smaller, and it was easy to be found whether it was running away or using magic. Lucien and the magic apprentices seemed to be in an extremely dangerous situation. Situation, this is Annick, why are they not desperate and depressed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Amora Staff", Lucien is a bit accustomed to the fate of fate, suppressing tension, worrying about fear and not rushing to calm down. While gently taking pictures of Annick, Lei Yiya and Heidi's shoulders, they told them not to be afraid, while listening carefully to the conversation outside, thinking quickly in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s voice is loud but with a good taste: “Cuidi Pastor, the sailor’s cabin is dirty and smelly, how can you make this kind of noble person with identity? Check it out? Just look at the damage to the cabin. Give it to me and the sailors. You just need to drink black tea and wait in the room, just like the bishop and the priest."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Tom Sailor, I am just a pastor, although it is already high-level, not far from the official pastor, but according to the "Teaching Code", you still can not directly call me a pastor. "This trainee pastor, called Cody, is arguing in his mouth, but with a clear joy in his tone, being able to be called a pastor is his life's dream." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Scriptures are the sacred teachings of the church, and the Holy Scriptures are the "laws" of the church, which stipulates what the clergy and paladins should follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Cody’s modesty, the attitude became more harmonious: “Tom’s sailor is long, I’m very grateful for your kindness, but it’s related to the repair of the gods, check The things can only be handed over to me and the trainee pastors and knight attendants. Your sailors have not been properly educated, and it is impossible to tell whether the surface of the finished board is damaged by the magical array. Therefore, I can only be sincere to you. Say a word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s current identity is a dark knight loyal to Viscount Wright, a god who believes in the truth, but because of the dark blood, Can not be the same as the official knight, become the captain, can only be a local low sailor. No matter what, as a dark knight who is not wanted, Cody faces him, but still maintains the most basic courtesy, and sees that the knights of the knight ranks respect themselves, Cody is getting better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Cody’s words, Tom didn’t know how to answer it. His sailors were indeed poor people and had no education from any knight or pastor. They went to check that the gods were good enough to let them die, and the ones hidden in the sailor cabin could be inspected but could not be exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luoman, De Boer... You check this, Jacques, Sami... you go there." Cody sees Tom no longer blocking. Begin to enjoy the thrill of giving orders, these high-level trainee pastors who are usually in the same position as their own, high-ranking knight attendants, now have to listen to their own arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Cody’s arrangement, seeing the trainee and the knight attending the cabin separately, Tom’s heart was anxious, although Lucien and the apprentices were hiding. The cabin is in the far corner, and it takes a lot of time to check it in the past. However, there are still no way to find Cody and several trainee pastors and knights in the aisle. There are countless thoughts flashed in his brain, and the miserable exposure of his identity can not help but emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tom is ready to stop waiting for the "others" to stop, take a risk, pretend to be a fisher who has not escaped, killing people, suddenly he feels someone touched I touched my arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it...Ivan...you?!" Tom turned his head and saw that Lucien was standing next to him, but he Wearing a dirty sailor suit, his face was painted with the oil paint that the sailor liked, his hair was messy, and his head was low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scared Tom to almost shout out, but fortunately he was a formal knight, with strong body control, and closed his mouth after issuing half a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hoared and said: "Head, the lower level of the cabin is very damaged." He said, while quietly writing on Tom's arm. Draw a word. It is a magical parliament, shouldn't it be illiterate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many dirty and low-slung sailors and coolies on the boat, how can he know how to be a noble trainee pastor? The same is true for the knight attendants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom quietly experienced Lucien’s fingers and found it to be a short word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jacques?" he thought in confusion, but immediately saw Lucien pointing to the cabin over there, suddenly suddenly, probably guessed Lucy En asked, looking at the cabin where the apprentices were hiding, whispered: "Let him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded, himself The sailor cabin calmly waited for the opportunity, patiently listening to their conversation, suddenly heard the name of Jacques, and the answer was the same as the previous cargo main cabin, so I thought of a way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucine was put on the sailor suit in the cabin, painted on the face, and pushed open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gambling is that the trainee and the knight attendants will definitely not care about what the sailors are not blind to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing which sailors have sailors are on their own side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s thin and gloomy face showed a flattering smile: “Cody, the cabin below is the main battle place, the damage is serious, and there are many places leaking. It's better to send some people down to help check and repair, which will not only make a good impression on the pastor, but also prevent the big waves from sinking the sailboat." He hinted that several priests are repairing the gods and cabins below. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the above cabin, you leave four or five people to check it slowly, and when it is fixed below, it is already over."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cody's expression becomes serious, and being diligent in front of the pastor is a great way to make a good impression, although his own progress is mainly dependent on the god of truth. Devotion and mastery of knowledge, but if the pastor is slightly inclined to allocate resources, or take care of the location of the church, his promotion speed will be much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tom Sailor, please help the trainee pastor and the knight attendant to check the cabin." Cody quickly decided to greet himself. A good relationship with the companion goes on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Cody." Before he spoke, Tom took the first step and walked to Jacques. He smiled and said: "Mr. Jacques, according to Cody. I am going to take you to check the cabin there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques is a blond young man with a straight, beautiful and elegant nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Tom’s initiative, Jacques is also very proud of himself and has a good talent in many aspects. He is quite proud. Cody has nothing to say, leaving five Six of the trainee pastors and knights who were not waiting for him rushed to the lower cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the repair of the magical array is related to whether the sailboat will sink in the ocean where the storms frequently occur, these left behind are still a bit complaining, but still seriously check . One of them stood in the aisle and commanded to prevent the fishermen from slipping out of the net, and the rest went to different cabins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques went with Tom and Lucien to the corner cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked while his right hand drooped and wrote a few words in the back of Tom's hand: "Left hand, fist, blood burst."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s eyes flashed, recalling Lucien’s assassination of Brown, and guessing what he meant, if he made a fist in his left hand, he broke his blood and concealed his display. Fluctuation of magic: "He is ready to charm humans? But now the storm is very small, the bishop has returned to the ship, and the blood force to cover up the magic fluctuations is very poor, and it is not likely to be discovered!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his uneasy mood, the three went to the corner of this cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques saw the strange sailor diligently pushing the door open, nodded with satisfaction, and then stepped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabin is as empty as Jacques expected, just as he was going to check the planks near the window, a mild magnetic surname suddenly sounded in his ear "Mr. Jacques, if you can't be an official knight after three years, what should Miss Cherie do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
