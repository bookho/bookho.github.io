			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mushroom cloud entwined with flames rises, the black gas scatters the smoke, and the blue-black giant whose head disappears and the body is broken is abnormal. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the different ethnic intelligent life that formed the giant body suddenly came to life, and the tide generally rushed toward the head, densely confusing, less than a few In a second of time, it reintegrated a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The vitality' is really stubborn, it is a famous masterpiece of the Necromancer." Lucien’s hand in the hands of the "time and space scepter" The bodies of humans, elves, and dragons have become quite sluggish, acting like puppets, slowing down the speed of recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien appeared in the black pupil of a cold moon, turned into an epic knight, pulled out a silver-gray sword, turned into a sword light from the sky The meteor squatted on the black-black giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Lu Xien who does not want to use magic to solve, but the monster will chase it at any time, can not waste time, can use the sword of truth to crush the nature of not to do anything else s Choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray sword flashed, and the black-and-black giant had an unreal crack in his voice, which directly separated the defensive layer, black gas and **, and Innumerable small branches spread to all parts of the giant's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, in the crisp sound, the body of the intelligent life turned into a piece of finely rotted flesh and blood, like a sudden torrential rain . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the showers of blood, meat and pus, Lucien’s silvery moonlight is entwined, and the “rainwater” that will fall on the body will evaporate. ", I caught the broken heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body is blue-black, the strong and powerful beat gradually slows down until it stops, and then the flesh of the surface peels off layer by layer, revealing the shallowness of the thumb inside. Green liquid, filled with a strong life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out a silver teapot-like thing engraved with a magical pattern, opened the lid, tilted the "not old spring" inside, and then re-sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We continue on, not far from the location of the Muskilllin logo." A little bit of Rhine has come over and urged Lucien For him, "not old spring" has no effect, but rather a poisonous existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien collected the magic silver jug ​​and prepared to dismantle it. At this moment, the surrounding cries suddenly sounded, and the temperature seemed to drop again. Ten degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜, in the cries of scalp and numbness, a piece of tombstone fell, one by one, the lid was opened, those black, gray The white clothes seem to have their own life, staggering and standing, twisting toward the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movements of them seem to be deformed, but they are extremely fast, and it takes a long time to merge into a huge doll, a doll with a colorful coat. The rag doll with a secret smile on his face made Lucy, who was instinctive after becoming an epic knight, aware of a danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this custom?" Lucien asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shook his head: "I don't know, I know a lot of the customs in all kinds of wonderful customs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dolls exude a scent of legendary third-order, slowly forming in a weeping smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusian has no idea of ​​fighting, although playing all his strengths And the items, plus the rich collection of the Rhine, there is still hope to defeat this strange doll, but this is very time-consuming, it is troublesome to catch up with the real monster, and it is very likely that after killing the doll There will be other necroons, and the battle may continue indefinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to lift the transformation, Lucien grabbed the arm of Rhein and turned into a moonlight flight, illuminating the gray wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, there was a black door in the tombstone group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weeping and strange laughter suddenly appeared in Lu Xi'an's ear, and the "wall of space" made by his scepter around the time was inexplicably disintegrated, and the moonlight was lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shuddered fiercely, only to feel a cool breeze in his neck, "Epic Knight's body" appeared signs of dissolution, It seems that only clothing such as "The Robe of the Great Arcanist" is not affected, and of course, they are not working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this "cloth doll" that is difficult to use common sense, Lucien did not look back, still flew straight to the black door, and at the same time, the right hand clenched the truth The sword did not look at it and went to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver gray sword flashes, more than a few times more than just screaming crying The cold wind that blows into the neck stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not go to the acceptance of the results, too late to check the black door, directly hit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜呜呜!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being thrown into the gray hall, it is more exaggerated like crying Laughter came into Lucien's ear, and he breathed a sigh of relief. The moonlight glowed and the black door was blown off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door is heard, the black door bends forward and seems to be knocked open at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien scalp numb, while calculating the coordinates, while opening a different black door shuttle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several gray halls, Lucien and Rhein finally got rid of the secretive ragdoll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Muskilllin’s place is next to it..." In the calculation, Lucien’s pupil slammed and the emotions of countless magic settled. Can not help but boil, the heart involuntarily violently beat up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will I see there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you find the secret of a monster? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it an unimaginable scene, or a sign of horror and despair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine was so sullen, sorted out his black shirt and red jacket, then smiled and pointed at one of the black gates: "Should be Behind it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Lucien walked over and checked it with magic first. After confirming that there was no danger, the door would be slow. Push away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the reversal of sound, everything behind the gate appeared in Lucian and Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is this?" Lucien tried to control his emotions before he let the disappointment rise and cover up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black door is followed by a similar gray hall, which is no different from other places, even the silver and white pattern does not remain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check it out carefully." Rhein converges with a smile and walks into the gray hall, focusing on finding all traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien confirmed that there was no problem with the coordinates, and he followed the step. Suddenly, he felt the slight fluctuation of the "曰之冕" of the chest, as if Something in the hall senses each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this induction, Lucien stood in front of a gray pillar and checked it with various magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Lucien sighed: "It is a third-order prophet. This secret door is a hidden example. If there is no '曰之冕' The instructions, I am afraid that the existence of the legendary peak is likely to be discovered, and will be missed if it is slightly different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that Lucien will inspire the secret door, then I posted the "曰之冕" on it - although Lucien has a lot of ways to crack it, but it is the easiest and most time-saving to use "曰之冕". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray hall is lit by the sun that does not belong here. A secret door opens slowly, revealing a messy gray chamber, which is broken everywhere. Magic test tubes, alchemy furnaces and potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
