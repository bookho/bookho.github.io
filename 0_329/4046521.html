			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Nika’s eyes confused and immersed in intense thinking, Lucien quickly interrupted him and said straight away: “This is the power from the earth. We are also called gravity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the earth?" The germination of the world, the concept of fire and feng shui has not yet been raised, so Nika It’s still a look that is eager to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slightly: "The power of the earth will bind us to it, let the moon and the stars rotate around, so that the birds can only flap their wings. Fight against it and fly freely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Lucien performs "gravitational disorder", letting the small things on the table float from time to time, sometimes falling . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika holds a heart that doesn’t know any monsters, will abandon it, then watch it fall quickly, fall to the ground, and make a dull sound, Serious and dignified: "The power of the earth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy on the side has widened his eyes: "Guest, you, you are also wise?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika was pulled back to God by the voice of the little boy, looking like Lucian in a frantic manner: "Can you tell me carefully? And you just now "The problem of division."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We still have something to leave, wait for me to give you some books for reference." Lucien pointed to Nata Shake's left arm wound, "Mr. Nika, don't know if you have seen a blood-red flower from the rhizome to the petals? It can prey on small animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Because I don’t know what it’s called “bloody family”, Lucien uses a description of the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika groaned, slightly frowning: "You are talking about Groning flowers? Aki, you go take a picture and show it to this gentleman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy Axi took back his curious eyes and walked quickly to the storage room next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nica only noticed that both of them were injured, so they condensed the crazy expression: "Do you come to me for treatment?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have magic, I only need to prepare some potions to help." Lucien waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic?" Nika feels that everything she hears today is so fresh, words have never been heard from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his chin against him and smiled: "It is the extraordinary power you currently have."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika briefly silenced, feeling that this guest is too mysterious, and Natasha next to it seems to be affected by the decline in physical fitness, just laughing and listening to Lucien "abduct" talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Axi walked in with a bright red flower, it was full of fist size, and Lu Xien looked up and laughed and got up. I took the flowers: "Is it, Mr. Nika, can I borrow an empty room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a qualified magician, Lucien carries with him Carry an alchemy hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika is not very good at communication, listening to Lun’s saying this, hurrying and nodding, completely forgetting that the bloody family’s ownership belongs to him: “Aki You bring two guests to the empty room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left his chest and said slightly: "To express my gratitude, I gave Mr. Nika You have prepared a little gift, please bring enough parchment or grass paper to come over.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika shook his head: "You are my guest, Helping you is right, no gifts, wait for us to discuss..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gifts are books about magic. Lucien interrupted his words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika smiled and said: "Aki, go get all my parchment!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All, haha, Lucien, your magician is sometimes direct and cute." Natasha smiled and commented in the mind connection. "For example, you have been in the lab until now, and you have not kissed the girl, haha! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mapping of the Magic Principles to the Model Construction Process", "The Marking Meaning of Constructing Graphics", "The Foundation of Magical Geometry", "The Elemental Equation Behind the Magical Formula", "Elemental Preliminary", "Low-order Meditation Classification", "Preliminary Alchemy"... Nika stood next to Lucien and saw that he had read a book and read a name. His body was shaking with excitement, his eyes lit up like the stars at night, and he completely forgot other things in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien translated the introductory book of the Magic Apprentice series from the Soul Library and converted it into Babul text, then smiled Nikadao: "When you finish this, you can sort out and simplify your knowledge so that you can master them more deeply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic Talented talent, Lu Xien must of course lead to the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you!" Nika, who knows the value of these books, thanked him for the book name. Then he was a little embarrassed: "Respected guests, this Is there knowledge of the earth power you just said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien indulged, seeing a lot of parchment left, so he pressed his hand again Above, three thick books were printed: "The three books, a piece of knowledge about gravity and related theories, and provided better computing tools, one is a classic book on electromagnetics, and the other is a book. It is the latest system of elements and alchemy. Although you can hardly understand it in a short time, reading them will help you build your own knowledge system from a higher level and initially establish a more complete framework."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy", "Electromagnetic Theory", "New Alchemy"." Nika wants to stick his eyes to these three books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy Axi also looked at the books on the table, and did not know what he was excited to ask: "Teacher, what are these books?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pulled Natasha and went to the room. Suddenly, he stopped and asked: "Mr. Nika, I don't know if you have it here." There isn't an iron block like ice crystals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a little help to seize the opportunity to mend the Holm Crown Ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! How much do you want to use!" Nika said without hesitation, has begun to look at the books in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is sinking, and the Nika Castle is getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to a room opened, and Lucien and Natasha walked out in a spirited manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think your left hand has not lost control in the afternoon, hey, if it's like this in the next six days." Natasha laughed and teased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a tense and eager rush, Lucien has already deployed the "Heart of the Sun" to remove the curse toxins from the two and refine the seven elements. The alloy, repaired the Holm crown ring, slightly repaired Natasha's Violet guardian armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deliberately crows and said: "It is always very quiet before the storm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Reassured, I don't care." Natasha waved pale justice to show that the situation was good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the "Organic Showroom" slammed open, and Nika rushed out with exhaustion and excitement, and raised the books in his hand to Lucien. "Although I only understand a little bit, I can feel the profound mystery and unparalleled value in them. Dear guests, please tell me, Derrick Douglas, Edwin Brooke, and the road. The whereabouts of the three great sages of Sean Evans, I am going to follow them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗, Natasha couldn’t help but laugh and provoke Lucian coughed twice to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you read a little?" Lucien is strangely this, although the high spirit of Nika means that his soul is strong, memory and thinking ability Outstanding, without a foundation, it would be unthinkable to see some of the contents of these three books in one afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nika’s face was slightly red, and he licked his fingers: “A little bit. I first read other introductory books, with a general impression, after understanding the relevant vocabulary. I just turned up these three books. There are only a few problems in it. I usually think and study them, so I can barely understand them. I finally understand what elements are, what are atoms, what is gravity, what is lightning. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
