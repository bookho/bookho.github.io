			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Lucien often receives bad news attacks, it is a bit uneasy at the moment: "Mr. Rhein, what has changed? What will happen?" Change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead hides a truly immortal secret, and any change in it can not be underestimated, especially the Rhine is so solemn, is it the dead world Invading the real world and creating "the undead natural disaster"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the change is. You know, I am trapped here and can't get out of it. I can only sense the dead world through special methods." The deepest part of the terror that is enough to subvert the world is weakly recovering. Maybe after a year or two, there will be a change, and the development in the wrong direction may be the biggest." Rhein is neatly dressed, not trapped, but seems to be participating. Elegant banquet, although the tone is solemn, every move is methodical and not flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien frowned: "So, I should inform the Supreme Council of the secrets of the Necromancer."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if his teacher’s storm dominates, Lucien has no more than 30% confidence that he will not be greedy after he hears the immortal secrets of the dead world, and does not kill I’m out of my mouth, after all, the time I get to know is still too short, so if things are really serious enough to be risky, Lucien will choose to submit to all the Arcanists and legendary magicians when the Supreme Council meets. They are much safer when they are under each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I haven’t been serious yet, I haven’t told you that I’m leaving a place to look for the secrets of the Necromancers? After using these arrangements to help me get out of trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine Rarely did not laugh at Lucien, has been very serious, "I know that you are still far away from the promotion of the promotion, You can only try to find a way to get the strength close to the high level within half a year, and then try to spend half a year to start these arrangements, then I will give you a spell, maybe he can suppress the instigation in the depths of the dead spirit. This method can neither get rid of the difficulties nor solve the problem of the dead spirits, so you will submit the secret to the Magic Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lucien It is not a foolish and stubborn person. If there is no way in itself, then there will be no more secrets and the worst results will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He?" Lucian asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine dignified nodded: "The ancestor of our blood family, closest to the existence of God, the real immortal silver moon incarnation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very particular about words, not immortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aitna?" Lucien saw the name in many books in the Magic Council, rumored that he and the Pope are both from the illusory god restricted area. Recent existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are only legends about him, and there is no ranking in the purification sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's mouth twitched a bit: "You can also call him Etna, the original existence of which name, but your magical council inherited the evil of the magic empire Tradition, like to use the female surname to describe the gods, essence, truth, etc. The only problem is that the Pope has always been a man, otherwise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is His, But I can give it a try." Lucien also thought that if the method is not reliable, he will directly risk submitting the secret of the dead spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you can really see him, can you ask for a slice of meat, a drop of blood, and a hair for me to bring back to study? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lucien, who has evolved into an arcane research madman, thinks divergently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine See Road Sean promised to take care of his half-length silver hair, revealing the familiar smile of Lucien: "I don't think one day, we two Will be busy saving the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, my teacher has been stopping me from destroying the world, Lucine silently whispered, "Mr. Rhein, where do you need to go? Start?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go first to my castle in the dark mountains, take away the deformed mask, open the magical array of things, and the rewards you deserve, Then go to the endless Wang Yang 'polluted seas' of the scorpion fisherman's altar, the sacred mausoleum of the southern desert of the Gusta Empire, a palace of the sun god Tanos of the sacred empire capital Antwerp, in silver The brightest night of the month inspired me to set up the magical array, and finally returned to my castle, lit all the lights, and stood in the aura of the silver moon to recite the mantra." The projection of the Rhine began to shake, seemingly lacking strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient times, there were three magical empire, Hillovers, Meshkate and Yasuo. Mesh Kate is more inclined to the magic of the dead, illusion, summoning, etc., occupying the southern desert, oasis and the southern dragons and swamps of the Gusta Empire. The Yasuo Empire is famous for its navigation and underwater architecture. The islands of the Principality of Calais, the Kingdom of Buriana and the Pearl Islands on the endless oceans, the rest of the vast area is occupied by the most powerful Hill of Vernon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhehe smiled and said: "I have no ability to arrange such a strong magical array. I can only use the altar, the mausoleum and the underground palace with power to put them in a certain Converging on the space nodes, rest assured, as long as your strength is close to the high-level, you can make good use of the deformation mask and the magic items I gave. The danger is much smaller than the notification of the Magic Council. The only problem is that the time of half a year may not be too late. You have become high. Going after the order, basically it is a general dangerous task, the result..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really..." Lucien had to say, "I want to In a few days, I can set off. In a sense, I am a high-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial realization of the cognitive world is the highest level of promotion The hard part is that the magical ritual is not a small failure. The second is to analyze the six-ring magic. Finally, the spiritual power and the soul reach the point of direct interference with reality. Here, Sean has completed the cognitive world. Substantialization, the analysis of the six-ring magic is also very Nearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland also had some understanding of magic. After hearing the words of Lucien, he took a breath and looked around the dream. He laughed and laughed at himself: "Don't you?" After I was trapped, there was a problem with the sense of time? Although you can't project to you after entering Aringe, how many months have you returned to Aringe?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge is the most dense and often open city of the magical array. If the Rhine wants to project, it is easy to alarm the arcane guardian and the legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing is hard to say clearly." Lucien moved his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are getting more and more fun, waiting for you to be quick and legendary, it is even more difficult." Rhine sighed. "Then you act as soon as possible." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream disappeared, Lucien opened his eyes and recalled the conversation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the things are hidden. His understanding of the realm of the dead is probably deeper than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, sometimes, the secret knows too much It’s not good. I want An’s heart to wait for the promotion ceremony of the high-level magician three years later. It’s not possible to face the failure. Fortunately, there are a lot of powerful magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slammed up, scared Affris, and his tail slammed, almost breaking the chair of the "Pale Hand". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't do anything!" It stressed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately you can’t bring this little guy to go, or else... although it’s mainly because of confidentiality, but the picture that Lucien’s mind is emerging is Aphrodite. The scene of the looting of the treasure house of the Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the most troublesome problem now is that the teacher does not agree with me to go out during this time, what excuse to leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Heidler City, a magical tower banquet hall, a pale white candle gives a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing here, Lucien had the feeling of attending a funeral, holding a white drink and wondering if it should be drunk, Aphrodite had no taboos. Enjoy a variety of exotic foods, fried yellow locust-like food, bread with a hoe-like shape, and a "five-dirty" platter... "Is these guys a necromancer or a performance artist?" Unwillingly shook his head and saw Felipe wearing a black long trench coat and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe walked in front of Lucien, his pale face was a faint smile: "I thought you didn't have the courage to come to Heidler, the magic level If you are low, you are worried about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you didn't face to see me accepting the Immortal Throne Award." Lucien replied Felipe One sentence, "I am an audit committee member of the parliament. What should I worry about when I go to the organization within the parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
