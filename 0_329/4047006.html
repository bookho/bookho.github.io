			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, can you buy it or not? Don’t stand here to hinder me from exchanging.” The staller sees Oliver in front of his booth. Read and study the two books "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" and "Basic of Calculus", and screamed out loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Oliver took a nap and looked back from the feeling of being in the paradise of heaven. He waved two books. "Buy! I buy! Which organization are their authors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t wait to see such a wonderful mathematical system and shock theory. The magician, express their inner excitement to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although because of the basic relationship, he can only roughly read it, and even did not have time to learn in depth, but this does not prevent him from feeling the beauty of pure mathematics. And the gravitational pull of the era brought by gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Honourable Douglas of the Magic Council, the author of "The Foundation of Calculus" and the 'Mil Silver Grey' of the Magic Council and Mr. Fernando." Mentioning them, setting up stalls There is also a clear respect in the tone of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took a low-quality sea bream and happily collected books and other materials, and said to himself: Magic Council , are the magic council, I am going to join the magic council! “<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This level of books is unbeatable for a beginner’s shock!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few words, he looked up and looked at the stalls with both eyes. He was scared that the stallor had stepped back a few steps. He said vaguely, "I, I didn't sell inferior quality." Product. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you tell me where to join the Magic Council? Oliver asked excitedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staller sighed quietly. Not very angry: "If I knew, I have already joined!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he said with a strong heart: "For more than two decades, the church has maintained our oppression, and all organizations can only lurk in development. So easy to join? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe I can ask!" "Oliver has made up his mind, even if the magical parliament female magicians are very rare, they have to join them!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he constantly asks in the market every A person, even if he is disappointed and frustrated again and again, but does not affect him to continue to ask. For this reason, he paid a lot of treasures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is so conspicuous The behavior also makes it possible to secretly observe that the "soul supreme" mage of the bazaar roughly confirms that he is not a night watchman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is a "soul supreme" magician to see On the face of "Soul Stone", he added a sentence: "Mr. Fernando of the Magic Council is here. You are waiting there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to the forest path outside the market.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Fernando? "Oliver was so excited again. He ran to the side of the road waiting for a smog.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specially separated by a hidden magician to monitor him, make sure he would not This information leaked out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ten minutes, Oliver saw a short man in a red magic robe and a lich. A skinny man came from the corner of the path.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you are not very good, your "body structure and circulation theory" Still can barely read it. Fernando yelled and said that he hardly praised people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente coldly smacked his face, his tone plainly: "Although you are a pervert, you On calculus, it is ok. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is tit for tat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando licks his mouth and uses the pressure of arcane exchange The urge to roar - within the Magic Council, the theory of Vicente is summarized in the Arcane.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver stood in the distance not far away, listening to the three people discussing the theory they completely could not understand, suddenly produced a feeling that he had just entered the magic gate, and there is a vast world waiting to explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, I want to join them and discuss the mysteries of the world and the human body!" Oliver quietly made a fist and made an ideal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Oliver almost sure that the short red robe mage was Mr. Fernando, so he waited nervously, and when the three approached him, he stepped. Going over, using the standard magic etiquette, gracefully swearing: "Mr. Fernando, I am a post-graduate scholar who admires Lord Douglas and your profound knowledge, I hope to join the Magic Council and listen to your guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he was uneasy and stood still, afraid of being rejected, afraid to miss this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a look and said with a serious face: "Our Magic Council welcomes every magician to join, but one must explain in advance, where to join The parliamentarians must accept the openness of the parliament's open discussion and accept the rules that the Arcane will be open to other magicians in the form of papers. Of course, the author of the paper will receive the corresponding remuneration from the parliament and each reader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arcane?" Oliver asked a little blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando explained the definition of arcane once and repeatedly asked: "Can you accept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver thought about it, except for the spell model and some spell-casting techniques, he had no arcane theory to be cautious and secret, so he solemnly nodded: "Mr. Fernando, I am willing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, it’s so easy to join the Magic Council, Oliver is excited to have an unreal feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently beheaded: "But before that, we need to accept our review. After all, we can't let the night watchers mix in."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." This sentence made Oliver's unreality disappear and rediscovered the sense of down-to-earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente listened to Fernando’s conversation with Oliver and felt that he had nothing to do with him, so he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ice and Snow Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrien looked at the information at hand and asked the seven-level cardinal in charge of the referee in front of him: "Why don't you pick up a few nobles?" They are suspected of colluding with the magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal respects but is not afraid to be authentic: "Adrian, they are just suspect, we don't have any Evidence, the Lord teaches us that we can't just doubt others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No evidence? No evidence!" Adrien sullenly, lost a book to In front of the Cardinal, "Did you have seen this "Sorcerer's Skull"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal glanced at the cover and said quietly: "The mad dog has become a magistrate from the night watchman. He does have a lot of experience. Many of his ideas and practices are really suitable for the magician's activities. But Adrien, here is the northern region, which is one of our original developments. With the most pure faith, the nobility is trustworthy and cannot Compared with the Erm area.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrien’s eyes looked at the cardinal with anger, almost accusing him of covering the fallen and betraying the Lord, but Reminiscent of other similar things he saw during the time in the northern province, he suppressed his anger and nodded slightly: "No matter what, there will be more doubts in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cardinal refused to retire, he only raised his eyes with a heavy face, and the northern province was a bit wrong, and must investigate it secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years later, time has come to the Holy Calendar 424 The end of the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrien looked at the thick stack of materials in front of him, his face was still grim, the problem of the northern province was more serious than imagined, many clergy Colluding with the nobility, dividing the property, enjoying the fall, forgetting that the magician has not been almost extinct, forgetting that the war in the dark mountains only consolidates the margins, and they seem to have different opinions on the doctrine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
