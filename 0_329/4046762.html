			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mathematical problem that you can't solve?" After hearing the words of Lucien, Natasha was full of interest, with a fearless attitude of the ignorant The paper in front of Lucien picked up and slammed the pages quickly and found the ten mathematical problems listed later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four-color problem...Lusien conjecture...barber paradox..." Natasha’s mouth twitched, whispering these questions, then sinking A long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at her with a funny smile: "How? Any thoughts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha woke up, as if she had broken free from her nightmare, and used her surname to rub her own chin: "It’s difficult to solve mathematical problems, good, very difficult mathematical problems, and it is necessary for the entire parliamentary arcane master to work together. Lucy, what do you think of the current situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember you just asked me this question some time ago." Lucien's mouth smiled The finger tapped on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s head is raised, and it’s just as authentic: “You don’t always say that things are always in development and change, static is relative, movement and change. It’s absolutely, but now it’s been a long time since I last asked you about it. During the fission reactor explosion, there was an incident in which the “God of Craftsman” Hite turned to the name of the god of steam. Change!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found your eloquence getting better and better." Lucian ridiculed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha held her left chest in her right hand, bent slightly, and walked with a gentleman's ceremony. The smile was full of face: "Thanks to Mr. Professor, your guidance, you are in each There are unusual opinions on the side, opening a new door for me, hahaha.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when she said the last sentence, she seemed to think of something Very funny joke, almost straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s mouth twitched a bit, regretting that he usually told Natasha too many meaningful jokes: “... In fact, the current situation is very Clear and complicated, starting with Vikken's secret disclosure of the god-like method, we have entered an era in which you compete for it: the legendary peak hopes to become a god, the ordinary legend wants to be promoted to the peak, and the non-legends try to advance the legend. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not just a personal struggle, but also a race, a force, and an organization. It’s a little behind, maybe it’s the end of the demise, even if it’s not dead, It is becoming weak, and in the future, if you want to catch up, you have to spend ten times and one hundred times the cost. It is very human can be done. Moreover, the law of the gods of Viken needs faith, which means fierce fighting, everyone It may be a friend, whoever is probably an enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Lucien fully describing the current situation, Natasha put away a smile: "I never It is normal to think that the laws of the gods of Tanos and Viken are normal. The hidden danger is too big, and it is too cruel. I have to use emotion to transform myself. What is the difference with the devil? Maybe this is a very competitive era, but I will not give in and I will find a path that suits me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Lucien didn't say too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha took a picture of Lucien’s shoulder and understood the truth: “I’m relatively easy to upgrade from the legendary level. You have to be promoted to the peak. Difficulties, and regardless of your real thoughts, whether you want to follow the path of Wicken, many people who are afraid will also regard you as a competitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Innocent, guilty of sin, Lu Xien summed up the meaning of Natasha in idioms in his heart, solemnly nodded: "Whether for myself or for you, I will not stop moving forward, no matter how much Blocking can't stop me from being promoted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing "the secret of immortality", Lucien probably had a little guess about the similarities and differences between the two worlds, but Need to prove, you need to find a variety of phenomena to support, so for the time being do not dare to propose quantum field theory, standard particle model to advance, after all, if there is a discrepancy, they will burst their heads! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dozens of legendary third-order, more than a dozen legendary peaks, the 'opponent' in front of you is not weak." That being said, Natasha The silver-purple eyes are shining, and it seems to be full of confidence in Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this view, the atmosphere is getting warmer, Lucine pulls Natasha, ready to warm up, but at this time, Natasha suddenly Said: "Right, what about the pollution caused by the fission reactor? What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smirked, a smug look: "I am concerned about very serious pollution problems. As a king, I am competent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you deliberately..." Lucien licked his forehead, but his face was filled with a faint smile. "I proposed to clean up the eternal blaze with small power, and was rejected by the teacher, so he solved it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Heidi, who is concentrating on making tubes with magical arrays and alchemy items, almost fell on the ground, but fortunately she gave me instant magic. Stabilized the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? How did the city of the sky shake?" Ellerstin and Nordaniel were caught off guard and could only seize the metal pipes by the wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half a month after the start of the new semester, Ellert took the opportunity to take a tour with Ardene in Ariel, and met a bit through Heidi. Excellent magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked at the assistants, such as Cherie and Lovi, Ophelia, who had fallen to the ground, and shook their heads helplessly: "How do I?" I know, this is the city of the sky, there is no reason to have an earthquake, and the high-altitude hurricane can not pass the half-opening lock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she wakes up "The last time we encountered shaking, the teacher said that it was caused by the uncontrolled explosion of the fission reactor at the core of Aringe. Is this also true? No, after the last incident, another reactor has been shut down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she has not experienced the horror of fission reaction, she said that the reactor is out of control, just like the accidental damage of a magical array in the lab yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fishering reactor... I hope not to cause big pollution..." Ellerstin whispered a little worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "City of the Sky" core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at the secret room where the pollution was basically cleared, looked at the magical walls and floors that melted and damaged, and nodded with satisfaction: "Or eternal blaze It works..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He denied the opinion of Lucien and tried to find other ways to clear the curse pollution, but the effect was not ideal, at least cost It takes more than a month to complete, and a better method needs to be created. Therefore, his surname is violent, he is busy studying why the reactor is out of control, and the fire is rising, and it is weakened in the wide room. Most of the eternal power of the eternal temperament, let the Aringe lock once again open the highest level of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bang, the world is clean...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month, the city of Rentatt, the dwarf-populated workers’ area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of Augustus, the leader of the great elder Augustus, fell under the silver-white "nuclear bomb" and performed once a week. Big prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "mysterious disappearance" of Hammer, the messenger of the "God of Craftsman", has caused things that Augustus and Harold are not worried about, but this kind of thing Encounter, for the first time, there will be a second time, the fat and unresistible prey will inevitably lead to waves of ripples, so they have a serious sense of crisis, constantly using various rituals The activities strengthened the belief of the tribes in the true "Steam of the Sun", in order to enhance the cohesiveness, so as not to be blinded by the magic of others, and to attract the god of steam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other pseudo-gods, they may not be in the heart, but the gods of the dwarf craftsmen will definitely kill their seemingly solid foundation, after all, For the dwarves of the night plateau, there is no change of faith, just to find the "incarnation of the god of steam in the world!" This kind of air-to-air bragging, if there is no Lord to lower the gods, it is difficult to resist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dominate everything, control the boundaries between life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has his right hand squinting his eyes, deeply worshipping on the ground, under the cover of solemn and solemn voice, is the real thought that is anxious and looking forward to: "The great god of steam, Please give your devout believer the magic, let us defend your glory, practice your way, and build Atlantis on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
