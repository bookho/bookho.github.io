			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Sandra tried to soften her voice and tried to use the unique affinity of her female surname to calm the boy. Don't be so frightened, but she forgot that she is good at fighting, even if she tried to squeeze out a soothing smile, the fine temperament could not be concealed. The little boy shook his head, and the four limbs hurriedly climbed to the corner of the secret room. The mouth screamed and his head was buried deeply. It seemed that the eyes did not see, and things did not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not urge them to rush to the bondage, because the strange devil was too surprised, and finally there was a death and a question mark. So since you have discovered a new survivor, you must ask carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze was handed over to Sandra, and Lucien’s chin was lifted up, pointing to Susan, who was tied by Charlotte’s “Great Palm of Douglas”: “ Use medicine to settle her emotions, and she will talk to the little boy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra is a veteran female surnamed magician with a delicate mind The advantages are shown in this respect. In her storage bag and in the hidden pocket of the magic robe, there are medicines that may be used in various situations - even if a large part of them are not used for a few years, and the medicine for calming the mind is common, so she nodded. Take out a tube of clear and transparent light blue liquid and directly pour Susan into the hands of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she would like to use the sleep technique to let the little boy fall asleep, and then ask him to hypnotize and charm people when he wakes him up. This is closer to her acting style, but it is still unknown whether there is a problem with the little boy. If there is an accident when using magic control, then the important source of intelligence is lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the single-lens to stimulate the constant "Fernando's electromagnetic communication", although the suspected five-level devil, three of them Heli is not without a way to get rid of it, but things have changed, or to contact Gaston according to the agreed means, after all, no one knows whether this devil will just be an aperitif! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the monocle has a dense layer of ripples. Lucien did not avoid Charlotte and Sandra, and said directly: "Hey, hello, Mr. Gaston?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This five-ring magic currently only converts sound vibrations into corresponding electromagnetic signals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no response on the opposite side of "Electromagnetic Communications", Lucien sounded louder: "Hey? Hey? Hey?!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monocle is still as quiet as dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation became serious, and Lucien looked at the wall at the other end of the bookshelf, which had a glass window, and the outside of the window was filled with faint Mist. It is twisted and twisted, like an ugly idea. It seems that if you can't thoroughly understand the changes in the human heart, you can't penetrate this fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Similar to the fog of the mind, but not exactly the same, can block and absorb electromagnetic waves, belongs to the extraordinary power that has never been seen..." Lucian is very calm Judging, I feel that my knowledge is not enough, and I am very good at it. At least 70% of the books in the "Basic Arcane Library" have not been seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s use of “electromagnetic communication” sounds loud, and the name of the call is also the member of the Arcane Review Committee, Gaston, who has been naturally People are concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte followed Lucine’s gaze and looked out the window. He looked ordinary and temperamental and showed a bitter smile: “It seems to be in big trouble, simple The task is not 'not simple'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have some hunch, and Lucian thought in confusion, the possibility of this task changing all the time In my own imagination, it can be a bit unrealistic when it really happens, it’s too coincidental! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anyone who wants to deal with me, who is it? How did you get through Ms. Florencia and Mr. Gaston?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar question arises in Lucine’s mind, but it has been suppressed, because now is not the time to think about these issues, the danger will come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most critical issue we have now is to figure out the situation as soon as possible, decide whether to retreat or move on." Lucien first glanced at Charlotte, then looked at Susan, who turned to her mood and slowly stabilized, was already a full minute away from taking her medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charlotte, Sandra, don't you know what kind of demon is that monster?" Lucien found that Charlotte could not identify the monster, and asked with a slight surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that it does not appear in the ordinary "Devils" and "Monsters", and if you don't know its identity, you can't completely Knowing what unique abilities it has, and so on, whether it is retreating or attacking, it is difficult to choose. For example, when receiving a task, it is clear that there are low-level devils, demons, etc., so Lucien and others are not ready to use invisibility - dragon Devils, devils, etc. can be seen invisible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte and Sandra shook their heads with a serious expression, indicating that they did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the monsters that high-level magicians need to face..." Sandra groaned, seeing Susan’s mind recovering a lot, After communicating, he pointed to the little boy in the secret room. "Do you know him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan turned her head in confusion and then exclaimed: "Hey, Bill, are you still alive?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy who was trembling and his head buried between his knees and the wall was slightly shocked, then very slowly Going back to my head, slowly said: "Su, Susan sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?" Sandra asked Susan in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan gave Bill a soothing smile: "It’s me, Susan, we came back to save you. Bill, don't be afraid, calm, calm..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly moved forward, using gestures to calm Bill, while turning the face with deep fear to Lucien, Charlotte three: He is the youngest apprentice of Bertrand's teacher, and his natural spirit is extremely outstanding, but he is very talented in the basics of arcane learning, often ridiculed by other apprentices. I and Scott often guide him, so the relationship is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You asked what happened to the castle later." Lucien stepped forward and followed Susan to Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Bill saw Susien and Charlotte behind Susan, he was scared and shivered, his head swayed, and his black eyes were extremely Big, full of fear: "Don't come over, you devils, don't come over, don't come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his hands, smiled and Charlotte Specially slowly retreats together, and Sandra tries to make her expression amiable, and Susan is holding her hands like a sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Bill’s mood is no longer so intense, although it’s still trembling, but at least it’s no longer twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bill, tell me what you saw in the castle?" Susan squatted in front of Bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After following, Sandra’s silently cast the second-ring magic of “telling lies” – it does not directly cast a spell on Bill’s body. Therefore, I am not afraid of causing major changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill’s hands jerked out and firmly grasped Susan’s arm, almost scared Susan to fall backwards, and then he said with a terrified voice: They are all dead, and all are dead. Andy, Debra, and Mr. Stevens are all dead! They have already cleared the devil out of the summoning line, but inside, inside, there is a How can I not fight the horrible devil, then, then they all died, all died... I have been running all the time, but my feet are so soft that I can't run, I have to hide in this secret room. Susan sister, fast belt I am leaving here, I am so scared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy, Debra, Stevens are Bertrand's assistants or disciples, all in one ring Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "lights of lie" did not change, so Susan resisted the fear of the devil and began to ask for details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Charlotte stand on the sidewalk, looking at the interior of the room through a long shelf, while paying close attention to the changes around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of the turn, Lucien suddenly found that a few pages of the table next to it were burnt down by the flames of the parchment, which was written in ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special summoning ceremony for the dimension (the latter letter was smeared)"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
