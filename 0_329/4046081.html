			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the paper group on the table, and Lucien took the letter out of the box and unfolded it. There are already a few lines of black words:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have received our gift, Mr. Evans, the three fingers are warning you not to make stupid moves, everything you do is in ours In mastering and observing, our power exceeds your imagination, and it is more legendary than the story you hear from the pub bard. Well, crush the 'ball of the scene' and you will see what you want to see. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien got the dark black ball, he already felt the magnetic name it contained. The judgment was recorded, so there was no hesitation. Just crush it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black smog filled out and concentrated in front of Lucien, and gradually presented a dynamic black and white stereoscopic picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people inside are Joel, Eliza and Avon, who are in a small wooden house, sitting around the only one Brown wooden table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s eyes are half-closed, nodding, seemingly full of drowsiness, and Joel and Eliza are looking sad, each with white on their hands. The cloth strips the wound, and through the small window of the wooden house, you can see the darkness of the outside and the stars that flicker in the air, while the silver moon is blocked by the dark and completely invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dynamic scene is a total of one minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original lines of the letter disappeared on the letter, and a new text appeared: "Mr. Evans, you have seen that they are still alive, as long as they appear at night When different weather and scenery, we will record a scene for you, so that you can judge each scene through different periods of rain, wind, lightning, silver moon and the number of stars. You see, we The credibility has always been good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gives me a lot of relief. Right, if John comes back this time, how can I tell him?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and answered, and there was a small part of the starry sky that had just been seen through the small window of the wooden house, and then a lot of The astrological maps of different seasons and different places are compared to determine which stars are used, and the stars are recorded with stars, and the angles of the stars are recorded and measured. Several stars are in the sky. Initial position, up to one minute Like change in their position across the sky and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astral magic is the deepest magic in Lucien's research! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to astrology, with the last experience of listening to apprentices, Lucien has almost mastered the apprenticeship, not to mention himself. Astronomical knowledge of ancient magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can ask how to deal with it, I am very satisfied. It seems that Mr. Evans has gradually accepted your destiny. If John returns, you will tell directly He believes that he will not take risks with his father, mother, and brother's surname. Also, Mr. Evans, please pay attention to Lata Summer Palace tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is going to talk to Princess Natasha at Lata Summer Palace every Tuesday and Thursday at 11am, and if the princess needs it, he can summon Lucien at any time. Of course, the reward will be different. Calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One word appeared and disappeared, the letter finally disappeared, Lucien folded it, and rewrapped the three broken fingers and put them back. In the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all the astrological diagrams of Lucien, walk slowly On the way to the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yesterday, I received a sight and a finger today, and I can have a basic judgment. Uncle Joel’s family is in a village and town near Alto. , or in the forest, or even a hidden place in the city of Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this judgment, many of the astrological charts in the witch's notes can be discarded. Sean quickly determined the identity of the stars by comparing a large number of astrological maps drawn in Aalto with the initial calculated trajectories and speed, and then found one of the known stars by looking up the catalog. The various data, and then based on its relative position last night, combined with the angle of observation, etc., have preliminary results:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that when I see the scene in the future, I am still in the wooden house, so that I can correct the data through natural scenery such as the silver moon." The star watch on the earth is useless here. Lucien is using the ancient star system. The catalogues and astrological maps used by the magicians must have a slight error. To be completely accurate, other methods are needed to correct them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, within two hundred meters, it’s easier to find a cabin, so Lucien’s mood is slightly excited and inspiring. The only problem is that The strength is not enough. Just monitoring your own enemies is much more powerful than yourself. Since the "Golden White Horn" dared to act several times in the church-controlled Aalto, their strength is certainly not weak, even if the cult's powerful characters still There are other big things to be busy, not responsible for guarding the small characters of the Joel family, but Lucien estimates that there are at least enemies with a formal degree of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really difficult every step." Lucian pressed his impatience and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although after discovering the problem, in a calm situation, Lucien’s response every step of the way is the best that he can do, and he has tried a lot of things. Determined where the Joel family was being held, but in the face of such a powerful enemy, these are not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the association, today is the other two roads A girl who is not familiar with me, one of them stood up and said slightly: "Good morning, Mr. Evans. Mr. Hank confessed, if you come, please go to his office, he has arranged your exclusive lounge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien originally wanted to find a quiet piano room, but it would be better to have his own lounge, so climb directly On the third floor, he found Hank. Under his guidance, he found the exclusive lounge on the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, it will belong to you later, unless you die, or join a music association in other countries." Hank opened the door of the lounge and pointed Gorgeously decorated room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concert association is very large, the atrium even contains a garden, and on the third floor, except for the office, there are seven or eighty such lounges, and the second floor. Nearly half of them are lounges, and Aalto musicians are very popular in mainland countries. Many people are accepted to leave after they are famous, so almost half of the lounges are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thick deep yellow carpet, red wooden desk, wardrobe, coffee table, a set of sofas wrapped in a beautiful dark blue coat, exquisite statues, decorations and The oil lamp, a semi-open, small bed room, a milky white piano, is a lounge that musicians can own. The Aalto Music Association has treated Lucien as a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled politely: "Thank you, Mr. Hank, I am very satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is what I should do, Evans, you call me Hank." Hank smiled and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked into the lounge, Lucien closed the door tightly and deliberately released the emotions that were suppressed before, seeing the grief after three broken fingers. resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking a few laps in the lounge, Lucian slammed into the milky white piano, pressed his hands and played the fate. The symphony is the only one that is currently capable of playing well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heated melody began to reverberate, and Lucien began to whisper as the loud voice suppressed other voices:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of bastards, even kidnapped Uncle Joel, let me go to the Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such words are covered under the cover of music, and they constantly spit out from Lucien’s mouth. It is not the purpose of Lucien, but the ability of the other party to monitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bombing, Lucien stood up and took a long breath, even if the other party really listened, it could be interpreted as venting emotions. So that there will be problems in front of the princess tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the home of Adejan district at noon, Lucien was pleased to find that the letterhead only said: "It is a good choice to use music to vent it properly, Ivan. Mr. Sis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
