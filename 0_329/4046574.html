			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hits Natasha and walks calmly toward the room at the end of the corridor. This position is so soft, even if the nose smells It is full of bloody smell and slightly sour toxin taste, and it is very satisfying, how can the smile not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha’s emotions are quite complicated. Whether it’s self-awareness or actual expression, she is a brave knight who has no doubt. A heroic and determined knight was held by Lucien. There is an indescribable weakness and shame, but with his own, Lucien, his heartbeat, his taste, his chest, are all like that. Familiarity, so that I feel warm and sweet, so it is joy and shame, and I try not to show my face on the face, and I am ridiculed by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of uncomfortable and somewhat unwilling to leave the contradictory feeling, Natasha did not find that there was a smile in her mouth that was difficult to hide, until Lucien stopped At the door of a room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The room of the Duke of James also has a magical array?" Lucien was quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha tried to shift her attention from the princess’s posture and looked at the room: “Several rooms on this floor were used by the Duke of James for reception. The members of the royal family and other great aristocrats, so the magical reading force on the overall defense of the manor, giving guests a private, non-snooping space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Her answer, she saw Lucian push the door open with mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very spacious interior with a living room, a bedroom, a study room, a piano, a bar, etc., with Lucien closing the door and starting the magical array. The whole room suddenly separated from the manor, quiet and quiet, like a private space that belongs to two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha knows that Lucien is just in case, he must be a little distracted when he leads himself to use the "healthy belt", if he is negligent If you encounter any enemies, it will be a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt a soft and comfortable touch on her back, only to find that she was put on the velvet quilt in the bedroom by Lucian, and Lucien was half-baked. At the bedside, the black eyes looked at themselves in deep focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice is slightly low: “Just you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not finished, Natasha interrupted Lucien and smiled. "We don't need to thank us. This is my guardianship concept as a knight and wife. I changed it for you. I think you will make the same choice. You When I put my left hand in my neck, I was shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shyness, no retreat, she said the word wife in a generous and candid manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that she stretched out her right hand and took the hand of Lucien, the fingers crossed, the palms were opposite, and the faint warmth passed to Lucien’s heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to say anything, don’t do anything, Lucien clasps Natasha’s right hand and feels the warmth between the two. Timeless atmosphere, then looked at her silver-purple eyes, slowly bowed and kissed her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha licked her eyelids, slowly closed and enjoyed the kiss, but the right hand's grip was never released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is slow and gentle, but it is more intoxicating than the passion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the lips are separated, Natasha’s eyes are slightly fascinated and she is restored to the Qingming, and she smiles and says: “Help me to suppress the 'powerless kiss’ ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you suppress the 'inability of the kiss'..." Lucien smiled at the same time, then the two stopped suddenly, looking at each other And laughter, a touch of tacit understanding between the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hurry up, if we delay recovery due to romance and be killed by subsequent enemies, it would be the top ten of Ariel’s most stupid way to die. One." Natasha is still able to recognize the situation as always. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "There should be no follow-up enemies." If you don't receive the secret message from teacher Fernando, you will not be at all in the secret room. Delayed Natasha’s suppression, and now, the unrelenting Queen’s majesty is not always encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believed that Lucien was prepared to attend a private party, so when she heard Lucien's words, she thought of "helping the army" with a tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Specially wait a minute, first help you recover." Lucian nodded, considering that the Duke James will handle the scene and will inform the heart of time Come, I can't stay for a long time, so I use the magic of "neutralizing toxins" to help Natasha suppress "the kiss of powerlessness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha regained her attention and began to condense her will when the "inability of the kiss" was briefly oppressed. After a few tens of seconds, her eyes silver There was a sharp, cold glow in the purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, Lucien’s mentality spread to Natasha through the right hand that was still handed over, guiding her through the “healthy belt” The magic barrier reaches the core and then erases your mark directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha was slightly surprised, but she didn’t want to think so much at the crucial moment, and quickly left her mark on the Central Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The healthy waistband of her waist has a soft white light, and the passive toxins have the following toxins to play, and a little dark green gas highlights the disappearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Natasha suddenly waved her left hand and said with emotion: "The feeling of lack of strength is really uncomfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her eyes moved to Lucien: "How did you erase your mark?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have The Ring of Congers, the effect of a healthy belt is very repetitive, and you are not so good for immunotoxins, diseases and negative energy attacks." Lucien said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holm royal family is rich, Natasha also has a great arcian elder, but high-end items, especially high-end items with special functions, have always been Rarely, even Rhein, a vampire prince who doesn't know how many years have lived, has only a few. Therefore, she has equipment that protects against toxins and other injuries, but she does not have a healthy belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha regained her strength, using the magical items to cleanse the blood from her body, and teased and said: "It’s a precious gift, it’s not there. Mr. Evans, who is known as the "Mobile Treasure"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Gewell said just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are my wife, my Majesty the Queen, nothing is more precious than you." Lucien found himself also a bit of a love of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted and said that Lucian’s words were very useful, but she deliberately said: “You picked three pieces from Mr. Rhein. The items, except for one reel, were all given to me. The adventure was really busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said this, Lucy The talents reacted. The items that were obtained in the treasure house of Mr. Rhein were almost given to Natasha, but they were very happy. It was very worthwhile. Mr. Rhein was really a good person. He didn’t know what he said to go to the bottom treasury. When will it be possible to pick an item? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you just didn't have something to say?" Natasha knew that there was Hathaway nearby, and she relaxed her mood and almost forgot about it. Something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cautiously re-applied several magics to prevent others from prying, and then the soul connected to Natasha: "The promoter behind this scene It’s Sarder, he wants to...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing doesn’t have to hold Natasha, she is Holm, and it’s going around anyway. But she, and her inclination in her heart is also very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't trust Sarder too much. He has always been too mysterious and too difficult to speculate." Natasha expressed her opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "He has no secrets in the realm of the dead, no one knows, so it is not good to judge his true purpose, we must Be prepared for his conspiracy, and don't blindly believe him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lord of Ketonia was drawn by him...the last time you were going to have flesh and blood What test results?” Natasha asked solemnly and solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this test is very important. Lu Xien is not good at using electromagnetic communication. Therefore, attending the banquet to see Natasha this time also includes the purpose of telling the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha listened with a blank expression, and sighed for a long time, showing a bit of sadness: "I don't believe in Sard... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she gathered her emotions and looked at Lucien’s worried expression, like a real queen and a knight who smiled and said: “Reassured, I don’t Will be reckless and impulsive, positive assault and killing enemies must also have skills and rhythm, I will fully cooperate with them, and wait until the geographical division here, then use this crime to try Ketonia, when he has no support It will not cause panic among the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After knowing the cause of death of her loved one, she really made up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, I and the parliament will be on your side." Lucian reached out and touched Natasha's hair, making her a little uncomfortable. Deliberately transferred the topic, hehe smiled: "Right, Lucien, tell you a secret..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read this secret from the soul connection Lucian’s face could not help but smile: “This is very good, I am relieved a lot.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t pause, Lucien saw Looking at the aristocrats who have been a little agitated outside the window, softly said: "I should inform Ketonia soon, I am not convenient to meet him, so leave here first. When you face him, don't worry, Lord Hathaway is here. Nearby, pay attention to everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Natasha suddenly showed a smirked expression, "There should be a few minutes, Lucien, I The strength has not recovered, you come to help me take this dress off and replace it with a new one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her safari is a high-ranking knight Clothing deformation Cheng, if there is no such, it may not be able to withstand Gewei for a long time, but under the curse, toxins and other corrosion damage, this item is completely destroyed, cracks and holes everywhere, can not be repaired like the Violet guardian armor, Fortunately, there were still a few of her high-level armor and knight suits that inherited the throne, so she opened the storage bag and took out a knight dress that became a purple dress, as well as underwear and stockings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heartbeat speeds up and his breathing is a little short: “There is no time...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You think too much, there is no time for you to change it for me.” Natasha smiled brightly and said, “This is the 'reward' that you have just held me like you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien smiled suddenly on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James opened another secret room in the Divine Array, Natasha’s long purple hair was rolled up again, and her face had a faint flush of red, which could not fade for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of James led a tall, gray-haired old man, and his dark blue eyes seemed to contain a long river of rushing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty the Queen." Ketonia paid a heavy salute. "The Duke of York made a big mistake and was involved in the assassination of you, but please see He was just watching and urging, there was no real plan, and the loyalty of the Ketonian family for centuries, giving him a certain generosity, and the Ketonian family would guard you more faithfully."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has obtained a confession from David, directly finding Natasha to plead guilty and seeking compromise and exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is awesome and strong: "If you can compromise even if you can assassinate me, then you can tell others, even if you want to assassinate me, no matter what." Success and failure will not be severely punished. If I do this, I don’t think I will live for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia will have to speak again, but Natasha uses gestures to stop:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, York and ElBaradei must die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And according to the crime of rebellion, the mastermind's ElBaradei family will be stripped of the title and the territory will be withdrawn. The Ketonian family is only slightly involved because of York, and only traces the individual and does not affect the family."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
