			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roast beef jerky..." Lucien’s expression is a terrible distortion. If there is no problem with his astrology, then this dark piece of meat should be The body that Ramiro separated, the "props" used to resurrect, was actually baked by the girl as beef jerky, baked...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know why, Lucian didn't feel sick, only an inexplicable smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately this is the Sonar River, there is no piranha, if it is in the wilderness, by the wild dog, then Ramiro is really The 'death is not eye-catching'," he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet-eyed "girl" picks up the branches and stuffs the black-stained pieces of meat into the mouth in Lucian’s jaw-dropping tongue. Inside, chewed a few times, then touched the stomach a little unwillingly: "Hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food on the side of the road don't mess around...Lu Xien The words that I want to stop are blocked in my throat without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long blond hair, scarlet eyes, exquisite appearance, no distinction between men and women, casually digested the flesh and blood essence of the Knights... The identity of this girl is on the road The heart of Sean is in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aitna?" Lucien asked in a dignified manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the god of the silver moon, Aitna, the strange intimacy and the inexplicable gaze that passed through here will make sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde girl staggered and stood up, supporting herself with a long sword wrapped in black flames, looking at Lucien without a sense of care, a little serious A little bit of complaints: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What food do you need? Blood? Day The flesh and blood of the knight?" Lucien guessed the current situation of the "girl" suspected of Etna, is it in the recovery period after the fall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucian’s question, the blonde “girl” frowned and thought about it, shaking her head firmly: “Not good.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you still roast beef jerky... Although it is likely to be the topmost existence of the whole world, Lucien can’t help but whisper: "Then you What do you want to eat? What can you recover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde "girl" is still a cold and faint look, but the scarlet eyes suddenly glow a layer Glory: "The cheese you used to hold on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheese? When did I ban cheese? Lucien was amazed, but in a twinkling of an eye, he recalled: "Is the master of the underworld you killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the world, I have only used it myself. A ban on shackles, that is to help Els escape from the underworld when they are out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blonde "girl" nodded gracefully: "Well, it is cheese like him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Need to absorb the surname of God? Any kind of surname can be, can only be in the field of silver moon, death, resurrection? How much strength do you have now? How long can it last?" Lucien basically confirmed that he is the silver moon love Turner, a series of questions blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitna’s nose twitched and the body became somewhat illusory and transparent: “It can only be like Him.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, his body is like a wave of water, more and more illusory, scarlet eyes are somewhat weak and half-closed: "I need to sleep for a while, be careful with one-eyed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, Aitna turned into a silver moonlight, and directed to Lucien at an unspeakable speed, and got into his left hand before he reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge will to the innocent, sacred to vast will not produce, the pressure of Lucien thinking stagnant, wait until he wakes up, look at the left hand, only to find There is a round of dreamy silver moon on the back of the hand, and then the silver moon slowly dims into the skin, and no longer sees clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly took a breath, Lucien was shocked at the existence of the class of gods, and he could live on himself like this, it seems that there is no entity. Can the material be impossible? But if it is the soul, the will, or the spiritual mark, just now he is undoubtedly an entity, and can also digest flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien tried to wake up Etna and understand the specific situation, but he still remained as it was, without any reaction, as if he really fell asleep and refused to disturb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Lucien to speculate on the passage of things based on what happened before and the words and performances that Etna had said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aitna’s illusory state is very weak, and the situation of injury and positional fall seems to be serious, not to recover in a short time, or even to sleep To be able to maintain, this can be supported by the fact that he kills the lord of the underworld."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He should have been staring at the underworld for a long time, or else he could not find the secret of the underworld. The gods that moved in, well, maybe He is the 'thing' that Ancehin’s mouth dominated by the underworld, but He has never started to 'good cheese', which means that he either has no grasp of killing the underworld, or Only one blow, waiting for an opportunity, avoiding being killed by the underworld and being stared at by other false gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can lift the imprisonment and eventually kill the underworld Master, you can judge that he is the latter situation. So, in the case that He has absorbed the surname of the death god, after a period of sleep, you should be able to accumulate the power to shoot for a short period of time. More, even returning to the gods It is necessary to absorb enough 'soul name', oh, if you can find the mysterious existence of the dead spirit world and let him absorb it, it is estimated that it can be recovered in the shortest time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is very clear about the description of "Silver Moon does not fall, the moon is not dead", but Aitna does not seem to die directly, and then the plan to return from "emptiness" may be that it takes so much time, more to silver The immortality of the god of the moon also feels too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Be careful with one eye', who is the one-eyed, can the silver moon god be careful?" Lucien frowned, thinking about Aitna finally said That sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s head jerked up and looked in the direction of the Temple of War: “The statue of the Lord of War, Anatanas, is a one-eyed middle-aged man. Is it that Ethena refers to Him? He knows the existence of 'Aitna' from the mouth of the underworld, and has absorbed the heart of the sorrow. In the current situation of Aitna, be careful that He can also say it, but no It is necessary to remind me, I will not go to provoke Anantan, even if El wants to kill him, the high-ranking Francis, Jacob, etc., has nothing to do with me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien knows that the vampires are very proud. As their first ancestor, Etna should be similar. Even if they are seriously injured, the ranks fall, the action is cautious, and the mouth is not Will be afraid of a "little" war master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless, otherwise weird." Lucien's expression became dignified, probably guessing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaking his head and converging his emotions, Lucien looked at his left hand with a grin: "Do I have the 'left hand of God'?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien changed his face a few times, and immediately started the mask, turned into a fish, and hid in the water grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the divine domain that is almost completely broken, a dark cloud of fog flies out, and when it falls into the water, Francis appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is very pale, it seems to have been seriously hurt, but his eyes, expressions and movements are quite excited, as if he had gotten in the palace of the underworld Small harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked back at the completely collapsed field, I carefully examined the surroundings. Francis shook his head slightly and sighed: "Leviathan’s talent is here. It’s a pity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he believes that both Leviathan and Anthony, who did not flee in time, died in the collapse of the meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little fish in the water, Lucien, did not come out to meet, in the encounter with Ramiro, met Silver Moon Aitna, he did A decision was made, the identity of Leviathan was abandoned, and the experiment of closely observing the changes of the gods was abandoned, and the darkness was turned into a dark sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night watchman Ramiro disappeared, and El absorbed the name of the god of the moon. Such a thing is likely to attract the attention of the church and send more powerful people." Come over, there is even a cardinal. At that time, as an El disciple, I am definitely the subject of investigation and interrogation. If I am not careful, I will reveal flaws, and Yinyue Aitna is indeed on me, if Prince Dracula, etc. Also came to investigate, at close range, maybe there will be inexplicable induction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
