			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Douglas asked, his eyes were on Lucien, and of course he had to give his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The celebrations of the previous arcanists are all associated with the congratulations of the promotion of the legend. It is too much trouble to be held twice, too time-consuming, and not The words of the legendary magician, I always feel that there is a lack of confidence, so I am going to advance the legend, and carry it out together." Lucien expressed his opinion, although the celebration was congratulated is a way for most people to feel Happy things, the past arcades are no exception, but for the same reason repeated celebrations, this joy will become numb, and thus subsided, it feels torture. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, during the celebration, the Elf Wang Ting, the Druid Presbyterian Church, the Friends of the Dark Council, etc. will let the legendary strong come, and it is easy to expose under close contact. The fact that he has been promoted to the legend, this will allow the enemy to avoid major mistakes in intelligence, and invest more difficult to prevent, more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not sit on the back of the chair at this time and nodded. "I agree with Lucien’s suggestion that the Arcane Master is the most valued inside the parliament. The title is the title of glory, but the legendary field is the promotion of the essence of life, which is the sublimation recognized by any profession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucien himself and him The teachers have said this, and the members of other top judges naturally do not need to entangle on this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers: "I have always worried that Lucien will become arrogant, arrogant and arrogant due to the two great achievements of 'Miracle Night', but today I am very happy to see that he is still so modest and cautious, rational and calm, and understands the important surname of his own strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tightens his face and endures The impulse to live in the laughter, the speaker's acting is not bad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, Lucien’s honour of the Grand Arcane Masters can’t be so quiet, otherwise it will cause bad ideas for other Arcane divisions. I think we can't see the growth of young people." Douglas continued, "I propose to let the 'World Real' channel, the 'Sound of Mystery' channel under the 'Sky Radio Station', repeatedly insert this message in the program, so as to make as much as possible Many arcans, nobles, and ordinary people know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the previous method? Do you still use it?" Helen placed thick books in front of him. Vaguely is one of the books that Lucien opened to her. She was so serious that she only gave a small amount of energy to listen to the content of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the habit of her meetings at the time of the meeting. The members of the top panel have long been wondering. Except for the particularly important issues and discussions of the relationship itself, there are very few Things can pull her out of the "world" of arcane and magic research, but in the last five years she has been rotating Allinge, and she has to tell the committee to wait for similar things, so she has to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The past method of the Magic Council is to inform the divisions, who transfer them to the magicians and apprentices within their jurisdiction, and at the cover of each journal. Both of them have been awarded the title of the Archer of the Great Arcane by the Council for what results, for three consecutive periods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas affirmed: "Before it was a special proposal that did not hinder the implementation of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some of the magicians didn't have the habit of listening to the radio, and the issue of the journal was still a while. I proposed to send a letter to Evans who won the title of Archaeologist to every high-level wizard's magic tower." "Prophet" Bergner said that he had a gray pointed hat with a tall tower and a goat-like white beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of high-level personnel has been scarce, and there are not many organizations in the Magic Council. According to Lu Xi’s vague impression, there are only about five or six hundred. A letter will not be too much trouble, and the number will be even more alarming. Therefore, no one of the highest panelists objected to the "prophet" proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and announced: "The first issue was successfully concluded. I awarded the Lucian Grand Arcane title on behalf of the Parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he took out a black-and-white silver star badge to Lucien, which is quite similar to the arcane badge, but the black is deeper, like an innocent night sky, three huge Silver stars are arranged according to the structural model of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The background is a little bit of stars, just like the real vast starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien wearing this badge on his chest, the applause sounded again, marking his official membership in the Arcanist and the highest jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second issue is how to effectively control the four coastal and northern coastal corridors, how to weaken the church's belief base." Douglas put away a smile, " Benedict II has twice performed the scene of God's Fall. I believe that everyone has seen that even if it is not the power of the believers to summon the projection of Heaven Mountain, it is not because they have such powerful power. It is not difficult to see that believers The prayers of the clergy and the clerics are at least the triggering medium for the display of the gods. If the beliefs of ordinary people are weakened to a certain extent, the use of gods and other gods may become difficult."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter what the effect, this is at least the direction we should work hard. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starlight Grant bluntly said: "I can follow the example of the church killing the magician and fight against the god of truth in the area of ​​the strait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one a tall, thin middle-aged man with no beard and hair Gold, neatly behind the vertical, like the eyes of the most brilliant of the most luminous stars, exudes exotic charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Elika, the "deformation master" of linen hair and eyelids, screamed, "The clergy in the coastal four-nation and northern coastal corridors are Developed in the direction of moderate sects, and closely integrated with the nobility, attacking them is to fight against the nobility, and our strength and control are far from reaching the peak. Acting rashly will only cause turmoil, give other enemies a chance, know that we control After this area, I have been secretly in contact with us, and the northern churches that have been shackled have been alienated a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed in the Principality of Calais for many years, she, "The Curse "Eye" has been inextricably linked with the local aristocracy, and is a pro-family within the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of the Curse" is also followed by the statement: "If we attack the internal moderate sects, we will no longer be able to rebel and persuade the clergy, nobility, must Use a more gentle and humane approach to achieve your goals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with Erica and Atlante." The sly Brooke said quietly, "I think everyone should have noticed that in the past few years, due to the launch of the 'Sound of Mystery', the loyalty of the Rantat ordinary people has declined a lot, which can be from the number of times of worship and frequent Degrees, contributions to the church, and their usual manners, etc., therefore, I think it is the most effective means to increase the popularity of magic radios and the appeal of radio programs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart's many magicians and apprentices are the most powerful cities in the parliament and can quickly detect changes in the general public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Brooke’s opinion, the members of the top judges, such as Silvermoon Scholar Holt, looked at Lucien, broadcasting this brand new thing is him. Invented, the specific program content is also formed under his guidance, he is the most talked about the broadcaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own field, Lucien was not modest, and turned his feathers in his hand: "The current setting of the two channels is more reasonable, plus The two channels that the Hoffenberg royal family and the Holm kingdom are about to start have no need for more programs, because for the ordinary people, the daytime hours are busy with life, except for the evening time, there is no extra I am free to listen to the program, and at the same time, if there are too many channels, they will not use them to focus on the 'Sound of Mystery'. The most important thing for us now is to reduce the cost of magic radio to most families."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we should ban private radio stations," Silvermoon Scholar added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the master of alchemy Klaus published a professional opinion: "Although there are a number of short artisans to supplement, but their number is still not enough, follow-up talent It takes more time to train, so for a long time, even if the cost of magic radio is reduced, it will not be able to reach the needs of large-scale promotion. If there are more mechanical achievements, let them assume the function of magic array, perhaps There will be a breakthrough in the surname progression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big-scale promotion, I have a plan with Natasha and James." Lucien will last year The matter was officially raised, and finally, "In addition to this, I still have some ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although, you always have surprises for everyone. New things." Douglas smiled and said Lucian continued, and the other top panel members did not object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
