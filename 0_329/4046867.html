			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Devil's Jungle", the bright silver moon dispels the dark clouds, hanging high in the air, and the moonlight that can be sprinkled is no longer able to shine through the magic tower. The narrow windows are no different from the normal season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of Etna, which is tied with the long blond hair, is getting clearer and clearer. The cold moonlight that had shrouded him before has spread to the entire magic tower. The rippling silver washes out peace and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his feet, Danisos has become as big as the small crystal Aphrodite, with a shocking wound on the back, a large flesh and blood The burning of the black flame continued to fall to the ground, and the transparent and indefinite viscera and the spine that seemed to record time were fully exposed. The most miserable thing was that half of his wings were split and revealed faint bones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the flames are slowly extinguishing, the other strong ones certainly have no doubt that "Time and the Dragon of Light" Danisos will come to the end of life. Even so, after being traumatized by the "Sword of Origin and End", his recovery will be extremely slow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he is squatting At the foot of Aitna, it is impossible to see that it is a dragon known for its strong vitality. I don’t know how long it will take to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around him, the "blood" of "one grain" rolling slowly gathered to form a colorless and transparent lake with flesh and half wings The magic floats inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ear, listening to Aitna’s very serious announcement, looking at the horror of the "Temporary Time Dragon" Danisos, the strong presence, including " The brains of the elders and Prince Dracula could not figure out what happened in the meantime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitna didn’t repeat it, scarlet eyes focused on the dull people. With their big eyes and small eyes, it seems that they are from the heart and believe that they will understand what they mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly became a bit weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Rhine retracted the huge bat wings behind it, and laughed: "The ancestors meant that the current situation is the most chaotic and dangerous since the mythology. The most vigorous and energetic, so He deliberately descended on the ground and led us out of the fog of this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have felt hidden under the wave of the times How turbulent the undercurrent is, any legend will be completely degraded if it is not careful, even if it is done, it may be stared, so for you, this is the worst era."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the transformation of society, the transformation of power, and the breakthrough in understanding the nature of the world will surely bring unprecedented opportunities. I believe that in the next few decades, It has the opportunity to add up to all the previous eras. Can you break through the self? Can you go further and realize the sublimation of life? You can't grasp it by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His silver eyes look around The eyes of the demon master, the brain of the elders, and other strong, smiles are elegant and beautiful: "So, for you, this is also the best time. As for the final result, it depends on what choices you make. In the current situation, organizations that are guilty and self-inflicted will certainly be suppressed and gradually die out. We must unite and reconstruct our dark parliament like the Magic Council so that we can secure ourselves in the future wave of times and seize more. There are many opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of the crowd, his mouth curled up and asked cheerfully:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein’s long story is in line with the announcement of Aitna as a "little child", and immediately let Degu The legends of Laguna, the mayor of the werewolf, Sony, the brain of the elders, and the eyes of the demon, understand what it is, and do not know for what purpose, "Silver Moon" has the idea of ​​integrating the inside of the dark parliament, and I want to be the speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, through this conspiracy of Danishos, Dracula, the Dark Lord and Ogg, He succeeded in winning the "Swire Time Dragon". In one fell swoop, he surrendered to the strongest within the parliament who might most oppose him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Dracula’s heart is both sorrowful and rejoicing. The sorrow and anger is that the ancestors did not trust themselves. This kind of thing does not find their own cooperation. The joy is that if the ancestor To become the Speaker of the Dark Council, you don't have to pass the Rhine to call Him as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our family is always ready to serve you for the ancestor." Dubner screamed excitedly before Sony, a loyal look, which made Lucien couldn't help but smile, it really is a big dog...<血 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood and the werewolf have the fastest attitude, and the other dark world's strongmen have a little bit of a sigh. The Taikulongs did agree to integrate the parliament before, but they are obviously I hope that I will be led by my own family, and the opposition of the former evil spirits must have their own reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were silent for a moment, and suddenly recalled the words of Rhine just now. Indeed, the world has become too dangerous. As long as it became a legend, it was more careful and not Greed, it is very difficult to fall, but now, even if you stay within your sphere of influence, you will be conspiring to become a container or stepping stone for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this is only the beginning, and when the initial conspiracy undercurrents are over, the forces of all parties are ready, and in order to believe in resources and other things, there will be another Twilight war, by the time, anyone can fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the legendary masters of the eye, the "six-armed judge" and other legends, whether it was the fall of the demon prince, or the endless king of the ocean, "the Lord of Hell" "Capturing the body is just to make them slightly alert. They don't pay enough attention. I believe that I am in a dark mountain range where there are cracks in the dense space and various hidden places. Even if there is any danger, I can avoid it in time, but I just met it. The traps that have been sent to them have sounded the alarm. Some things are not to escape and escape. Integration may not be a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that the speaker will be "taken" by a class god, which is simply the "thigh" that dreams of! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein seems to feel their inner struggles, adding a smile: "The things before the integration belong to history, the parliament will not pursue."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, "The King of the Dark Side" Ogg and the six Taikoo Dragons made up their minds, but they are not only based on the above reasons, but also that "Silver Moon" is in front of them. Without the blockage of the legendary peak, if you object to it, will you be spiked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you have a lot of secrets, Ogg can't take this risk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked up and looked at their own "president", wanted to see the powerful god that existed from ancient times, and then expressed himself to Him. Surrender, At this time, Aitna suddenly turned her head and looked at Lucien, pointing to the "Taiwan Time Dragon" blood and "meat" on the ground. And a wing, biting his lip, squinting: "Well, your food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he quickly turned back, as if afraid of himself His eyes will be nostalgic on the blood of the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, my own "president" seems to be a bit unreliable... The eyes of the legendary masters, the "King of the Dark Side" and other legendary powers are twitching. Just a moment, but they immediately realized that they could use this conspiracy layout to surrender the "Taiwan Time Dragon" speaker. The heart is more reliable than anyone else. Anyone who thinks that he is not reliable will probably become his food...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being able to be the speaker of the great 'Silver Moon', we are full of confidence in the internal integration." Whether it is the Lord of the Eyes, or the Taikoo Dragon, all respectfully Only the "brain of the elderly" hesitated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the "Silver Moon" scarlet eyes and his big eyes, he was still hoarse and answered: "Your will is My will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious "main brain" finally lowered the noble "head", if there is "the ancient time dragon" Danisos He can have other ideas, but now, the blood family has two legendary peaks, and other legends of the parliament have been unified. The "God of the Silver Moon" also seems to break the habit of not making a lot of shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of the Nightmare" next to it, because it was not watched by "Silver Moon", boldly did not express his position, and has decided to go to Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end of the matter, at least Lu Xien thinks so, but in the collection of "Taiwan Time Dragon Materials" and the dark council's strongmen say goodbye When he found out that others did not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, when are you going to leave the dark mountains?" "Six-armed Judge" Cervantes asked with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
