			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western skyline, a bright star in the afterglow, is a sign that the night is coming, and the mountains on either side of the Solna Valley begin to become dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien arrived at the agreed hidden cave, El, Francis and Jacob had already waited there, and they circled a large circle to get rid of the tracking pseudo After God and the priest, it was still earlier than Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leviathan, why are you so late?" asked the white-bearded Jacob, and asked for a spell to check if anyone else followed Lucifer. Yep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El and Francis also came over with doubts, not far from Husum city, and "Leviathan" appeared in Luna When I jumped into the river and left, I didn't need to get rid of the false gods and the priests' search. Why is it later than myself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said without hesitation: "After I jumped into the Solna River, I was hit by the tides caused by Luna, and I could not swim smoothly. Out of town, it delayed a lot of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Jacob nodded, and did not find someone tracking, so he let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El’s face is slightly pale, but his mouth is always smiling, very emotional: “This time, although I did not kill Luna, I am successful. Deprived of his surname, shocked other false gods. You are doing very well, I want to reward you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is our glory "Jacoa replied quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Francis took out a small laurel box from his arms, giving the cave a faint scent, with a hint of magic on it. breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what El gave him and Jacob to collect the name of the god of the moon, Ashin, without this box, "the mortal" can not see the surname of God Glorious, can't touch, let alone collect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great 'resurrection of the resurrection, fertility and redemption', this is the name of the god of the moon god Asin." Some unexpected to Lucian, Francis Simply hand over the "Shen Hui Guanghui" to El. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ello eagerly took the wooden box made of this laurel tree, gently opened in the face of Lucien, Jacob, etc. The road is like the cool radiance of Yuehua, and it is cold and cold, clear and cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without concealing his curiosity, Lucien focused on what was the glory of the surname of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wooden box, a little bit like a tiny silver moon is as solid as it seems, in the distant distance that cannot be touched, it is difficult to really approach, at the same time, every small piece There seems to be a lot of vague and ambiguous things in the silver moon, giving people a sense of sacredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These pieces are like a dead, quietly floating in a wooden box, occasionally with weak contraction and expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it a bit familiar..." Lucien saw a fascinating sensation of God’s surname, and the memory flipped. I started to think hard about where I have seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three of you are guarding me." El was in a hurry and screamed, if he was not worried that "Leviathan" would lead the enemy such as the war, He I have long been unable to control my own impulses. As long as I absorb this quiet and peaceful, symbolizing the undead moon gods, I can restore my strength and consolidate and expand my priesthood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Both Francis and Lucien looked a little bit eagerly to follow El's surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of El suddenly shrouded a layer of quiet and distant glory, giving both a sense of death and a sense of sleep, and a quiet corner of the heart, then He took this Glorious, put your hand into the wooden box and grab the floating silver moon fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of debris began to converge under the drive of El. Gradually, they condensed into a group of silver balls of light, like a small silver moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silver-white ball flutters like a heart, far and wide, solitary and sacred, as if the real silver moon is indifferently overlooking the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the reflection of the Necromancer's mausoleum, the rust-stained light ball floating above the Fenix ​​.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner layer of the Sun King underground palace, The white transparent light ball held by the statue of Tanos...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture is like a frozen movie, so clear and so shocking, although they Colors and details are different, but the height is above, can't be touched, can't be approached, keep changing, the sacred inexplicable essence feels so consistent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi’an’s flash of light seems to understand what it seems to capture the mystery of the gods and the ancient devils, but then Lucien’s heart rises more intensely. Doubt: Silver Moon Aitna's existence far exceeds all creatures, and so does the existence of ancient hell and abyss. Where did they come from? The seven ancient devils are also very different from the pseudo-god and the existence and manifestation of the gods. What is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you fall into the misunderstanding of thinking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the secrets of the dead world are more than I thought." Lucien sighed softly inside and raised a small question. "This month's God's name is because I saw it with a shackle, or is it because of the laurel box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-white ball slowly blends into Egypt In the brilliance of the right hand, let it slowly light up the cool color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of El is distorted as if it were a very painful thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance swiftly expands, and the cocoon envelopes El, and the heart contracts and beats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a burst of cold, arrogant, sacred and indifferent feeling emerged from the "cocoon", Guanghua converges rapidly and drills into the body of El, with He is thoroughly integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr opened his eyes, his pupils became deeper and deeper, like the starry sky at night, and the temperament of the whole person became more feminine: "My present resurrection, The three great ministries of fertility and redemption have been significantly strengthened, and they have returned to the level of the Afando era. At the same time, there are more undead and moonlight priesthoods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He There is a bit of doubt about what God should be called, not to mention the flames of Afando and the destruction of the priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection, undead is a field of death, flames and abundance belong to the realm of life, salvation, moonlight belongs to the spiritual and material realm, destruction includes everything, so you are a substance With the Lord of the Spirit, death and the master of life, but there is no need to trouble change the name of God. You can receive his faith by splitting an incarnation, and change the name of the god frequently, which is not conducive to the worship of your true believers. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is better to restore the name of the "Supreme Lord", the name of the "God of Salvation", so that everything in the field belongs to You, we will emphasize this when we preach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis is still moving El's "the only and all-powerful" god of truth, Lucien Then observe and record silently, I hope this experiment can explain some doubts in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, this is my real name." El eyes showed a strong ambition, no matter whether it was true or not, now, He I totally believe this and aim at it. "In the past, the false gods who betrayed, I will deprive them of their surnames one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this time God The harvest brought by the fusion of surnames makes him want to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El looks at Francis and Lucien with satisfaction: "Your performance shows your piety, I will give you a kind of spiritual name." ', let you become stronger and get longer life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, his right hand extended, a group of silver and white light balls floated on Above the palm of the hand, compared to the previous "sacred glory of the gods", this group of light balls has a little higher sense of being inaccessible and inaccessible, but it is still sacred and vast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the kind of 'spirit of the surname'. After the transformation of the gods, the surname of the gods can be seen by the naked eye... Is this the source of the priests to display the magic? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien probably understands what the "special name of the spiritual surname" of the false god priest is, but it is more confused, and the species of the spiritual surname will obviously be reduced. The pseudo-God itself's "power of the surname of the gods", so the number must be strictly controlled, which is consistent with the number of strong people of the major pseudo-god churches in the northwest of the Dark Mountains, which can be confirmed initially. But within the Church of Truth, there are thousands of priests, bishops, and cardinals who can cast spells. Even if the god of truth exceeds the level of Altena, the separation of the surname of God has long since become a common existence. What is the difference? Or is his level more than my imagination? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
