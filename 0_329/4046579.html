			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, Lucien followed the teacher to his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty aisle, Fernando looked thoughtfully at Lucien: "What kind of intestines are you cutting, and there is no influence at all?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he is also very good at necromantic magic, this faction still has a strong ancient magical empire theory, which is completely different from the earth in the development direction, for inflammation and disease. The internal organs can only be cured by medical treatment, magical medicine, etc. There is no need for surgery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the anatomy of the human body, focus on the relationship between different organs and various diseases, to develop new curses, rot, disease-like magic, or reduce In the past, similar to the requirements of magic, this also determines the classification of the internal organs of the Necromancers is quite general, the appendix, the cecum, etc. are treated as a unified intestine, and there is no fine distinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I named it Iris, recently when I dissected and studied Gewell's body, I accidentally found that if I removed this intestine, I used magic to suppress it. Gewell’s resilience has no negative impact, which means that it has little effect.” Lucien said that he had long thought of a good reason. Anyway, he recently had a nine-level dark knight as his experimental material. The teacher, the teacher is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the issue of immunity, it is already very small for the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "It can't be said that it has no effect, at least as the main material for the improved version of life hiding."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no disagreement with Lucien's anatomy of Gewell, but definitely affirmed: "You are also the time to deepen the study of blood, which is a useful supplement to the study of the soul, the future Many rituals that continue life require a foundation of knowledge in this area. Shouldn't you think about becoming a lich in the future? Or would you like to watch Natasha die many years before you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knight can't be turned into a lich, and the death knight will be attacked by negative energy, almost becoming another person, so there are not many legendary magic rituals that can work for her. The effect is very good. If it is more than a thousand years old, as far as I know, there are no more than five kinds. There is no outstanding foundation of the Necromancer faction. Even if you are a legendary peak, you can’t host it. At that time, you can’t always ask Vicente. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Is there not a teacher? You are just presiding over the dead spirit ceremony." Lu Xien remembered this in his heart, but slightly complimented the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not angry: "This little girl has the potential to promote epic, when she needs to continue life, maybe the teacher I have been exploring the real world. The process of the fall, and the materials required for these five legendary magic rituals are extremely precious, such as the "Blessing of the Dragon" that I continue to live now, is to join forces with Hathaway, and asked Douglas to help, the three killed a head The legendary Taikoo Red Dragon uses its blood and bones as its main material, and you may not have a chance to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary level of Taigu Long ......" Lucien found that this material is so hard to get to the extreme, the body of each dragon itself is very scary, as their age increases, their magical strength will also increase, the legendary level of Taikoo dragon in magic level The above is no worse than the legendary magician of the ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and most importantly, the current survival of the Taikoo Dragon is no more than seven, and it is a very important elder in the Dark Council. It is very difficult to kill. It is not a fake product of the Dark Dragon God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not pay attention to Lucien’s look at the monster-like expression and continued: “So, if you can’t find the right material, you can only find a way to create something new. Magical rituals, which require a fairly profound level of necromantic. Do you think that Hathaway does not want to continue Patrick's life? It is not that his body and soul are weak to the extreme, not the existing rituals can work, only small The increase is in the range, and Hathaway is not good at necromantic magic. It is impossible to create new rituals according to the specific situation. I am even worse in this respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not It is obvious that Vicente will not help Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Lucien solemnly nodded, but not too urgent, both Natasha and Natasha are still very young, or concentrate first Improve the level of magic, work hard to promote the legend, and consider this issue in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is a look of incomprehensibility at this time, proudly and succinctly: "This ritual is based on the quality of the material, the host's understanding of the soul and the body, and some unknown reasons, ranging from two thousand to five thousand years, and can Superimposed on other life rituals, I and Hathaway each continued for 4,700 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is close to the best level, no wonder the teacher is so Proud, Lucien thought silently, and then continued to ask: "What about other legendary magicians? Those who have not transformed the lich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Others I It’s not too clear. It’s a personal secret. I only know that Douglas is exchanging with the elves. With the fruit of the Elf Tree’s 10,000 years, the 'natural gift' ceremony is used. Brooke has never used any legendary level of magic. The ceremony continues the life.” Fernando opened the door to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook is no more than two hundred years old, and the legendary level is supplemented by ordinary magical rituals. His life can last for a thousand years, and there is no urgent pursuit. The idea, while Fernando is different, he and Douglas are both magicians who grew up in the ancient magical empire. They are over a thousand years old. Hathaway shared the ritual materials by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien satisfies curiosity and smiles: "Teacher, I will go back to the Magic Tower and place this 'Life Talisman' in the core protection area of ​​the Magic Tower. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This life talisman with a tail is not as terrible as the lich's talisman, and will not die if it is destroyed, at most it will be lost." The opportunity to be born again, but this is only the half of the property of Lucien, which can be exchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando's face became serious, indicating that Lucien advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien walked in with a puzzled look, he closed the study door and opened the magical circuit: "The highest review group has already cooperated with Sarder. Resolution, and met him secretly yesterday, each signed a magic contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone signed? What requirements did he ask? What is his promise?" Lucien gave the teacher the mysterious weirdness of Thrad, so the expression followed dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando called Lucien to come in, just want to hear his opinion, not concealing: "Every supreme member of the jury is signed, according to Thrall At the request of Germany, our magician requested Mardi Moss, the Lord of Hell, to swear by the heart of faith and sign the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the ordinary magic contract has no effect on the legendary magician. After all, the devils and other mysterious creatures that supervise the execution of the magic contract are not caught by the legendary magician. When the experimental materials are good, there is the ability to supervise and execute. Penalties for breach of contract, so this level of magical contract is often supervised by the nine Dukes of Hell, or swears by the cognitive world to the source of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the source of magic is illusory, is there still a problem, the specific binding force of the latter vow has always been criticized, and there have been violations of this vow to lead to the cognitive world. The collapse of the dead, there is no impact on the lively jump, although this often explains the vulnerabilities, but Thrad is obviously not willing to take the risk, asking the Hell Lord, the god of this kind to "supervise", and he His "faith of faith" is no problem in binding the clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord of Hell... He will come and marry this thing too." Hearing the horrible big man, Lucien couldn’t help but pull it. Rip your mouth. Fernando smiled and said: "If he used to, he would probably secretly intervene. The conspiracy is his favorite thing, but he has just been Yinyin Aitna. Once, lost important projections under your 'eternal blaze,' and hurt yourself. You may not be willing to venture again. The silver moon is almost restored. It is 'hanging in the sky and watching', and such a Projection may not be able to beat Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great prophet, the king of angels is probably played by Thrall himself, used to escape radical The clergyman and the night watchman, but he has not been positively acknowledged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hanging in the sky and watching" This is a common metaphor in the magical world, indicating Aitna s concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the vows you made? What is Sald's promise?" Lucien asked again about this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
