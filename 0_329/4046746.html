			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the lush trees, a cloud of dark green mist like a cloud floats over, and the arc is constantly flashing like a natural anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog slammed into a young wood elf and fell in front of Martha. His neck and hands were full of complex and mysterious patterns, just like ancient times. The shamans responsible for the sacrifices in the lost civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Martha, repeat what you just said, they are smearing your call to the devil?" Ferragad did not look at Felipe, Yuris Ann and A look at the magician, such as Heidi, directly asked Martha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his question, Martha’s face on the face of Felipe’s right hand and numerous myriad blood vessels withered, like fallen leaves on the ground, decaying Into the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha said with hate: "Just because of the 'Revenrow Dance' and the essentials of each movement, they think this is a ritual of summoning magic! It's so simple Is the funny summoning ceremony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand clearly knows "the dance of revenge", and suddenly a layer of jumping lightning emerges in his eyes, the legendary druid The breath seems to blend with the surrounding natural environment, so with his look, Yurisian, Felipe, Heidi feel the trees under the feet tremble, feeling the air is shrinking, feeling the clouds are condensing, feeling themselves Excluded by the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a pressure, even Aphrodite’s thick and heartless crystal dragon is also very tight and difficult to open. So Annick’s fast-changing gestures stopped, and Heidi couldn’t help but step back and leaned against the wall of the tree house. Yuris Ann’s forehead burst into cold sweat and wanted to smile and talk, but he couldn’t squeeze it out. Smile comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s flesh and blood squirmed and squirmed, and he re-extended a bloody, very light right hand with a layer of water shining like Just born from the mother's stomach. His short hair fluttered backwards, as if facing a violent hurricane, his body was tight and trembling, but his head was wide open and he refused to lower his tunnel: "Here... there is a book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unstressed Ellerd quickly added: "The Parliament provided a "Vicken's Special Summoning Ceremony", which also summoned the ancient devil through a simple, ridiculous and ridiculous ceremony. And the author of this book is 'Disaster King' Viken, the legendary magician of the past, the Pope of the present!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroop Forest is located in endless On the west bank of the ocean, although there is a distance between the kingdoms of the Kingdom of Holm and the Kingdom of Burriana, but for the legendary ranks, such distances can be called neighbors, so the life is long. The elves are no strangers to Wicken. After the Magic Council knew that he was the Pope, it added a lot of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Vicken's Special Summoning Ceremony?" Ferragand narrowed his eyes and took a hand, a quaint book in the hands of an elf. Flying to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top enemy of the hate faction is the human being who destroys nature, and the foundation of the faith of the truth is also human. Therefore, the church is undoubtedly the enemy of the natural hate The Southern Church, which has always wanted to encroach on the "heart of nature" and completely incorporate the elves into the "Glory" of the God of Truth, is a jerk who is many times more awkward than the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha screamed sharply: "Lord Ferragand, don't believe them, who knows if it is the summoning ceremony written by Pope Wicken! Who knows the pope? Is it Viking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrande has flipped over and the expression has become a bit dignified: "Although it is ridiculous, but this kind of funny looks mysterious Surprisingly, I have seen the "Fables of Allegory", but it has distorted all the good emotions, which is full of pain and hatred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long life elf reading There are a lot of books, but "Vicken's special summoning ceremony" is too much like a child's mischief, so it has not been valued and paid attention to by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellerstin sees that Ferragund’s tone is loose, and Martha’s music notes are also flying to him: “Hello, Mr. Ferragand, you can compare ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Ferragand, they are smearing me!" Martha's lips trembled and kept repeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit like, but Martha’s explanation is no problem. It’s not a mistake to write the details of the action.” Ferragad is still subconsciously maintaining Martha, "Can't accuse her of summoning the devil, it is the source of the sprite tree pollution, and must be investigated in more depth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha’s action shook his head very loudly: “Lord Ferragand, they will forge evidence, and the natural balance party wants to hit us with human hands!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Ferragaund's face changed and he thought about it: "Ellerstin, I don't trust humans, so I personally interrogate Martha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martha’s face suddenly showed a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Felipe and Yuris Ann feel that it is not appropriate. Who knows if Ferragand is with Martha? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellesting feels that his spirit is about to collapse, he does not trust Ferragad on his side, and Firagande does not trust humans and nature. Balance, so that no matter what the results of the interrogation, it is not convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I took Martha to the Elf Tree for interrogation." Ferragand made a decision on his own, and Elstin wanted to stop and hesitated. I don't know what to say, I can't say, Lord Ferragand, we are also skeptical about you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." At this moment, there was another voice coming in midair, and Lanhill and Atlante’s figure slowly appeared, and they rushed in time. come back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill carries a "simple short bow" wrapped in a branch and falls to the center of Ferragand and Martha: "Fira Gund, you are the leader of the natural hate party, you are questioning Martha, I doubt it can be questioned!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Annick see Trent returned and sneaked a sigh of relief. Before they seemed calm, it was terrible to face a legendary strongman. If he felt a little careless, he would be swallowed by nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphras pulled out a light green fruit from under the belly, stretched out his tongue, wrapped it into his mouth, and comforted himself with food. soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand waited for Lanhill with anger: "Do you suspect that I am the mastermind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing to doubt, but a simple shun, Ferragat, you won't even understand this?" The relationship between Lanhill and Ferragand has been bad, so The tone is aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand was silent for a while: "That will allow Her Majesty to interrogate and I will not trust you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill did not mention the unnamed town, gently beheaded: "Then I took Martha to the Elf tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fira Gund did not speak, and expressed his dissatisfaction and default with cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill turned to Martha: "You will get a fair inquiry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing this sentence, Martha suddenly made a crazy laughter. On the dark blue skin, the pattern grew rapidly, and instantly covered every inch of her bare skin. At the same time, her eyes became bright red and her demon was empty. The devilish scales spread from the corner of the eye to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fallen Devil..." The onlookers were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the devil ghost possessed?" Felipe whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Ferragand, run away!" Martha screamed screamingly. "They noticed the secret of the dance of revenge!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, her body swelled and exploded, and countless flesh and blood as the judgment of death came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the ground grew a dark green vine branch, forming a cage, trapping Martha inside, and stopping the splash of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vines are torn apart, but Lanhill has opened a short bow and pointed to Ferragad, a word and a word: "It turned out to be you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? Lan Hill, you really want to smear me!" Ferragad was shocked just now, after returning to God, anger surged The hateful feelings are beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lan Hill seems to have a complete natural illusion that emerges and condenses into a green light on his bow: "Martha's last words have exposed you. Moreover, it is you who ordered the blockade of the unnamed town. The elves who are possessed by the devil in the town are also following your natural hate. If not, we will not return in such a hurry!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves around are hard to adapt to such changes, all stunned, can not believe that the chief culprit is the Lord Ferragand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the "evidence of human magician investigation", Ferragad hated to see Atlante, Felipe and others. At first glance, I feel that my heart is hard to restrain. The hatred that has accumulated over the past few hundred years has completely broken out: "It turns out that you want to get rid of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going See Her Majesty the Queen..." His voice did not fall, and he suddenly found that his body was abnormal. The hateful emotion seemed to condense into substance, and the skin began to grow dark green scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Ferragad screamed screamingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellestin and other elves shook their heads in a sluggish manner: "Degraded Devil... Devil Projection... Really Lord Ferragand..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill is cold and cold: "Ferrand, accept the trial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is loose The condensed green light shot out, brewing, growing, spreading, flourishing, warm, decaying, decaying, deeply buried, brewing natural circulation seems to be contained in this arrow, the surrounding green green suddenly faded All brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Ferragad was disgusted by nature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferrande was not prepared directly by this arrow, suddenly opened before and after, green branches grew from his flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand screams again, and the voice does not consciously bring a strong hatred, so his body is blurred, completely inflated, and the branches are all changed. It became a strange and stalk of flesh and blood, which in turn attacked Lan Hill, Atlante and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forest suddenly became a flesh and blood ball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and others did not suffer from Atlante’s legendary magic defense, but waited until the flesh and blood disappeared, only to find both Ferragand and Lanhill Missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, Lord Lanhill will surely catch the Ferragade Court... He is a revenge hunter and is best at tracking." Ellerd's face Very poorly comforting other elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand was seriously injured and fled, from nature The residence has escaped to the forest near the gap of the abyss, find a hidden cave to hide, quickly treat yourself, and try to exclude the devil projection inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be?" He shook his head in disbelief. "Why am I demonized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Why!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of aversion, he has difficulty controlling his mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have learned the dance of revenge, because you are full of hatred." A cold voice sounded from the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lanhill!" Ferragat just wanted to resist, only to find that his power could not extend beyond the projection of the devil, and the body became weak unless Give up your mind and let the devil dominate everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned on the mountain wall and watched Lanhill walking in, watching his long blond hair shine in the sun, frustrated and resentful Inexplicable: "Why, why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill looked at the position of the sun and smiled: "There is still a while, waiting for the plan over there. At the end, things will succeed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?" Ferragad took the time to rule out the devil's projection. For the legendary strong, there would be no Once it is projected, it is difficult to extricate itself - before giving up the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the plan is successfully completed, everything will be as we expected The human face goat smiled smugly and saw Malfurion and the two legends fly over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
