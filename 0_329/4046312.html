			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zi Lily District, a nice civilian house. Ryan walked to the table and found a stack of newspapers on the right hand side of his plate. He suddenly asked the busy wife to ask: " Did the Aalto Weekly not come out yesterday? How come today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a manager at a business, he needs to know about Al In all aspects of the situation, in order to correspond to the purchase and sale of different goods, so subscribe to the comprehensive name of the "Alto Weekly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife, Elena, calmed her son and sat down while walking to the kitchen, and replied very quickly: "It is said to be a supplement. But I don't know the words, I don't understand what I wrote above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she picked up the lyrics of "Happy Angels, Holy Beauty, and Bright Lights on the Earth" The atmosphere of the restaurant and the kitchen immediately became cheerful and filled with a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following the voice of his wife, Ryan sang a few words in front of his son, and picked up the "Alto Weekly" "supplement". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started from the lowest level apprentice of the firm, although not the most intelligent and sharpest among the same apprentices, but he is the most diligent and hardest, relying on Perseverance in perseverance, he stepped out of the poor life, learned the text, learned a lot of knowledge related to business, and slowly promoted to the status of the current manager, a happy family and a fairly comfortable living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the first time I heard the Symphony of Destiny, he felt that it was his own voice, a spirit that he could not express, and music Strong resonance, even the family is crazy to like to go on the road to Sean? Evans's music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aalto Weekly was launched, and Ryan saw that the front page headline was a dark and solemn word:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Report". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan only felt scalp numb, and thought in his heart: "Which big man is called by the Lord?" This will make the sales of many goods or Prices have fluctuated greatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight moves down quickly, and the back is a row of dark black letters that look like a heavy depression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The immortal master of music, the great pianist, the conductor, a pioneer of the music age, the changer, the current symphony development trend and the structure of the leader, founder, perfection, the Lord's favorite Musical genius, Mr. Wayne Evans, took his unparalleled work in the early morning of June 4th. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......See this For a while, Ryan’s brain creaked, how could she not confess the servant with Lucien? Mr. Evans is linked. "Lord, he is so young, so talented, and can lead the Aalto music industry to develop for decades!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A little blurred line of sight moves down, the row of lead words is like a support arrow stinging his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Evans From the slums to the masters of music masters, Mr. is a life that never yields and never gives up. It is a life of battle, a glorious life!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ... let us express our deepest condolences, and bless the Lord's darling to continue to replace us in the Mountain of Heaven, to praise the Lord and praise the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illina is standing The breakfast came out and saw Ryan's face faint and grief, his eyes reddened, and suddenly he was shocked. He almost missed the food and knocked it to the ground: "Dear, what happened to you? Why did you cry?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...cry?" Ryan asked doubtfully and slowly, only to see the eyes rising, the things in sight Piece blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticker, he saw a drop of tears falling on the spread newspaper, and then it quickly spread and spread, the eulogy of the musician and nobleman It is ambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't believe this is a fact, his death is a loss that the entire music industry can never make up!" - Christopher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He brought us the spirit and joy that never gave up, but left without taking anything away. I don't want to cry, but I can't help but cry." - Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was promoted to the paradise mountain, leaving us with a peak that is difficult to climb the symphony. He gives us the 'wealth' which is not expensive, not poor. Rich, as long as there is a grateful heart and unyielding heart, you can harvest the most valuable things in life. If one day I die, I hope to be buried in the vicinity of such a great person." - Franz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan looked at the small group of waters and subconsciously said: "I actually cried..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Ade district is next to the gates of the market area, surrounded by piles of people, some of them sobbing alone, and some sad silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also many girls who embrace each other with tears and mourn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty, Joanna, and Simoni saw this strange and dignified scene after coming out of the Copper Crown Tavern, and they found a notice on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are not literate, the words dark as the base of the coffin make them understand that this is an obituary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which big man's death made the poor so sad?" Betty doesn't think that the death of a big aristocrat, big lord, and cardinal can make Adejan The poor people in the area are crying unless they cry and have a copper fair collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strong curiosity, Betty asked two guards who clearly showed sadness: "The two adults, the content of this obituary is What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor people in the Adejan district are basically illiterate, so the two soldiers did not have strange Betty’s inquiry, and she screamed sweetly, Then one of the peacekeepers said with a heavy heart: "It is the Adejan district, no, the pride of Aalto City, Lucian? Mr. Evans is called under the serious illness."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides revealing to Lucien’s friends of the Friends, Aristocrats and Musicians Association that he was killed by the evil wizard “Professor”, the church asked Natasha to announce that Lucien was seriously ill Like the things of the first few silver corners, they hide from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because a great musician who has just achieved great success and is loved by most Aalto people is killed by evil magicians in the city of the Holy Ghost. Alt's believers will doubt the church's ability to doubt whether they can protect themselves from evil by propaganda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not impossible to solve the problem of the body and Natasha’s insistence, the church wants Natasha to completely conceal Joel and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty stayed in the same place, feeling that his soul seemed to fly out of the body, and the whole person became very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betty, what's wrong?" Joanna asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty wowed out and hugged her sister’s shoulder and cried aloud: "Evans, hey, Mr. Evans, hey, sick... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she is honed in three years, she is under the age of twenty, and she still has a lot of girls who feel the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna couldn’t believe what she had heard. The calm, wise, determined and determined barisan would have died because of serious illness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Aalto’s soldiers couldn’t make such a joke, so she’s red-eyed and patted Betty’s shoulder: “Don’t cry, Mr. Evans is just He was summoned to Heaven Mountain in advance because his work is so good. You must work hard and live up to Mr. Evans's expectations and strive to be a powerful knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Betty nodded sadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ John rode the dragon scale horse and slowly entered the gate of Aalto facing the Black Forest in Melzer with a team of attendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto itself is the last big city before entering the Dark Mountain Range, so the distance from the Dark Mountain Fortress is not far away, riding a dragon scale horse even at ordinary speed Running and rest is only a day's time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
