			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, can you deduct the formula from the experimental data?" Lucien asked carefully and unknowingly, just like many questions answered by Fernando many times before. You must make certain mistakes to cover up the truth of "know too much". Otherwise, Fernando will definitely ask "Why do you think so" from the answer? "What is the basis for this answer?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando walked back and forth in the study: "No, I’m semi-empirically deriving from the perspective of wave-like and chloe energy sharing, combined with experimental data. There is a formula that is perfect in long waves, but it has stupid mistakes on shortwaves, an unbearable mistake! Can you imagine that when the wavelength is short enough, can an object release almost infinite energy? If this is the case, the Pope has already kneel and kissed my toe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every object that is not absolutely zero can produce heat radiation, the most typical It is the hot light source such as the sun and the flame. In the past common sense of the Magic Council, the essence of thermal radiation is to emit electromagnetic waves of various wavelengths, and as the temperature increases, the proportion of short-waves at different frequencies increases. If it is in the visible range, it will display different colors. For example, the pure flame follows the temperature increase, and then it shows dark red, deep red, orange red, orange yellow, blue and white, etc., which is in line with red orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. The main wavelength gradually becomes shorter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Fernando’s whispering roar and felt his temper, Lucien’s mind came up with the cool word “UV disaster”, which first appeared. Actually this is the formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, maybe there is something wrong with it, can I look at the formula you derived?" Lucien didn't dare to talk, turn his eyes The white paper on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando growled: "I have thought about it all night, and at this angle, I have no problem negligence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that he was just roaring, didn't stop, Lucien curiously picked up the white paper, saw the graffiti-like formula, and then changed the symbol to compare it with the formula in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s exactly the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s presence here, he thought he was verifying the formula, and Fernando waved his hand in annoyance: “Don’t forget, there is no problem with long waves, shortwave It’s stupid enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was too embarrassed when he was violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t mention it, and Lu Xi’en subconsciously verified it again. The long wave range is very close, and the short wave range has to be said to be a disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoothing for a long time, when Lucien had already begun to deduce another formula in his heart, Fernando sighed softly: "Let’s read the letter first, wait. Wait a second time and make sure the data is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher." Lucien regained his attention and picked up the first letter. It is the "Arcane Emperor" Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In combination with the experimental data you gave me, I got an empirical formula from the point of view that thermal radiation is not electromagnetic waves, but the molecules are emitted by heat... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Fernando interrupted Lucien and ridiculed: "When discussing the issue of heat radiation, he did not forget his opinion on particle theory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be more problems with different angles, at least not limiting the mind to electromagnetic waves." Lucien said euphemistically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "It is estimated that only he can abandon this universal heat radiation cognition without interference, and he has never admitted it anyway. Ok, Lucien, read it, and see what formula can be given by '100,000 why.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hundred thousand why? Lucien felt both eccentric and considerate, but he didn't dare to ask questions when Fernando was in a violent mood. He continued to read a little nervously - if this formula is the same as the other one in his impression, it is a far cry from the earth-shaking conclusion. Not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The above is the formula I derived, but it only applies to the short-wave range, and there is a clear contradiction with the curve in the long-wave range..." Lucien Almost mechanically finished this paragraph, actually it is the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer he is to the answer, the more nervous and calm he is, and he will not believe it without reservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Applicable to shortwaves? From a molecular point of view, can you derive a formula for shortwaves?" Fernando looked at the formulas on the desk that were derived for longwaves. Slightly confused and talking to himself, my heart suddenly raised an indescribable feeling of strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His doubts did not affect Lucian, with a lot of powerful souls, Lucien calculated the formulas in their minds, deriving from two perspectives The respective formula. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien’s heart is hard to contain, and it’s hard to contain, and he’s finally showing a corner of the world’s real fog. Will that constant be the same? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when Lucien completed the empirical formula of the molecular perspective, Fernando returned to calm, and some impatiently said: “Respond to Douglas, will me The derived formula is attached above, and points out the problem and scope of application to see what he thinks. Right, write a letter to Brooke, Hathaway, Oliver, Helen, Vicente, and both Douglas and I. Attached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien paused thinking, letting the beating heartbeat slow down, then pointing to the second channel on the table: "Teacher, here There is a letter from Lord Brooke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open it up." Fernando succinctly told me that there was no rush to forget to guide Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the letter and said in a moderate speed: "... Combine the experimental data you gave, I get from the perspective of wave-like and energy sharing. An empirical formula, but it is unexpectedly funny, only suitable for long-wave range, one to short wave is like a disaster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook got the formula and Fernando is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominated Fernando for a long time without speaking. For a long time, he said with a heavy tone: "I will write a letter according to what I just ordered."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes and thought quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien wrote the reply to the Golden Golem, and he fell into meditation and continued to deduce another formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a minute and a second, Lucien got a formula from the perspective of energy sharing, which is exactly the same as Fernando and Brooke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this mean..." Lucien's mouth is dry, his heart beats very fast, and there is a mystery and uneasiness about the mystery that will be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to stay focused and calm, Lucien began to mathematically piece together the two formulas to make it show Fernando and Brook in the long wave range. The surname of the formula is degraded to the Douglas formula when it reaches the short-wave range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s put together, it seems to be extremely quiet, full of oppressive atmosphere, as if there are demons and devils roaring and tempting in the ears, making Lucien’s head A burst of dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black scorpion became deep and cold, and Lucien was completely focused, without any interference, and the formula slowly formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Arcane Journal Headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drummond pushed open the door of the office, pointed his finger at the sofa, and said to the lady around him: "Isabella, please ask first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella is wearing a light, light green dress with beautiful lace and pleats at the neckline, waist and cuffs, and a very nice look on the head. Wide-brimmed hat, dragging a bright purple long ribbon behind the head, hanging around the tassels floating in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the wide-brimmed hat and hand it to Rachel, who is following his own disciple. Isabella’s beautiful face has a shallow smile, and the blue eyes are covered with Sincerely thank you: "Drewmond, thank you for this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just pushed the situation, mainly because the above you have this Thoughts on the side.” Drummond smiled and pointed to the top, “and your research results are fully qualified to win the title, which is what you deserve.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
