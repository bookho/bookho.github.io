			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Philippe Bell arrived here, the rest of the Cardinal members who had been able to withdraw had arrived, and Pope Benedict III stood with the Platinum Scepter standing on the steps. Behind it is a huge, holy cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call you today, there is a secret mission to you, which is about the glory of the Lord, the survival of the church, and your own future. Benedict III said seriously, the slightly cloudy eyes are deep and deep at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Avenger Melmos stepped forward: His Majesty the Pope, do not know what mission, need most of the Cardinal Mission to complete? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury he suffered when he was promoted to Douglas was not healed, so he was more cautious about the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III did not answer directly, but turned his attention to the glass window near the dome of the Daguangming Hall. The bright sunshine at noon was illuminated through the colorful glass. Sprinkle colorful dreams on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s promotion to the gods not only gave the magicians confidence, they saw the future of arcane and magic, as long as this road is not desperate It is hard to be tempted again, and it has greatly changed the situation in the whole world, changed the balance of power, and changed our estimation of the future. Benedict III repeats the current situation in a low voice, whether we like it or not, a god, four legendary peaks, and a legendary strongman who is not much smaller than us, are clearly there, magic The parliament already has the strength to compete with us and not to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we have to face the heresy of the North. In the face of the invading invasion of Mardi Moss in the endless ocean, facing the oppression of the evil god 'Silver Moon' in the dark mountains, the situation is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Cardinal members did not speak because this is the fact that they are clearly in front of them, although the Lord of the Marty, Mardi Moss, and the Northern heresy are also the Magic Council. It must be distracted, but at least the Dark Council and the Elf King are now their allies, and their side is almost isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the inevitable process of every ruling power from prosperity to decline, because their previous strength left too much impression on other organizations. They have formed a private resentment that is difficult to resolve, so. If there is no big effort to concede and unite. Before the other forces fight each other, it is easy to reach an agreement to overthrow the original ruling power, just like the ancient magic empire of that year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy voice of Benedict III reverberates in the Great Hall of Light: Although I am adhering to the will of the Lord, I will transform the initial immortality. And how to use the power of the Lord's gift to unite the mystery of divinity. I told you all. You should have gained something over the years and your strength has improved. The development of the Arcane in the past two decades, and the resulting expansion of the Magic Council, has forced us to face up to a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he paused and looked at all the Cardinal members who were emotionally present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Maria, St. Katie, Philippe, Estila, and other cardinals slightly lower their heads, seemingly avoiding the Pope’s gaze In the middle of the year, there was an endless stream of cults in the church's control area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III regained his gaze and continued: follow this trend, and before the fundamental improvement of your strength, catch up with the current number of new legends Before the Magic Council, before the birth of the new class-class saints, the overall strength of the Magic Council will definitely overwhelm us, step by step to defeat us, as the original magic empire was destroyed by us. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to scare everyone with the worst possible. You should be very clear that most of the wizards in the Magic Council have not really digested the development of the last two decades. The result, after all, the expansion of strength will lag behind the theoretical development of about ten years, and after ten years, you can become stronger to yourself, you know very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Benedict III, Cardinal Estila asks doubtfully: Your Majesty’s strength is very far-sighted. Our dilemma is very clear, but the situation we are facing now has one of the most significant and fundamental differences between the ancient magical empire, that is, we have your landlord’s spokesperson, the most powerful kind of god, and The strongest of the ancient magic empire was only the legendary peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Katie also stood up: Estila is right, the gods who can't be killed will keep the current situation going, and most importantly, the Pope is your strongest god, able to The display of 'God Fall', whether it is 'Silver Moon', 'Lord of Hell' or Douglas, can not resist, which can guarantee the status of the church to the greatest extent, so that they do not dare to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our strengths are raised, we can awaken the ‘master’. Under the glory of the true God, all evil will be completely melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke of his own expectations. As for whether he can wake up the god of truth and wake up in what way, that is another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing sighed a little: the god is not really immortal, at least I have a lot of hidden dangers, if I can grasp these hidden dangers, even if I can't Killing me completely, I can also imprison me like I am imprisoning the monster, and I have the primary goal of Douglas, Silvermoon and Maldives, and I don’t rule out the possibility of their joint efforts. When do we face it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Daguangming Hall, there was no cardinal group member answering, the atmosphere became suppressed and solidified, although the danger was still far away, but the audience under the analysis of the Pope . It seems that the worst may happen sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Majesty, what is your mission to us? Melmos suddenly broke the silence, is it related to the future dilemma? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing slowly raised the Platinum Scepter, and his expression became solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the members of the Cardinal Missionary Church immediately stumbled, painted a cross on the chest, and piously prayed: The truth is forever! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the gesture of the deity of the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord lowered the gods and told me how to solve the hidden dangers. Benedict III's tone is full of sincere gratitude. The reason for the use of ‘container’ is that negative emotions cannot be controlled and separated. It is because of the last step in the impact of the gods. The power of negative emotions is not equal to the power of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Maria subconsciously frowns: not equal? Are the forces of the soul that are not 'real', how can they be equal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly wakes up: His Majesty, Pope, I am not questioning the Lord, but I hope that you can satisfy my ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the power of faith is behind ‘Paradise Hill’. The ‘Heaven Mountain’ projection will appear when you hit the gods. The power of negative emotions will only condense the seven ancient devils. How do they match the ‘Paradise Mountain’? Then he lost his balance and left a hidden danger. Benedict III explained with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it equal? Feilibel asked, this is their biggest concern. Because they think they will come to this step sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benius III put down the Platinum Scepter and gently slammed it: Need more 'Ancient Devil', need them to 'condense' out of 'Ancient Hell', and This requires your cooperation. It can't be done by myself. In fact, this is completely consistent with the core of our God-like law. The power of the people is weak and strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, when I heard the words of Benedict III, the members of the cardinal group such as Philippe Bell thought of Lucien’s paper, which was thought of inside. Predictions - the evolution of weak observers to strong observers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Majesty, what should we do? Saint Katie asked, this kind of thing must ask every step, after all, involves itself, in case of failure, the ancient devil is out of control? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my guess, such 'cohesion' will cause a corresponding change in 'Ancient Hell', after that... Benedict III will explain his own arrangements one by one. Come out, no concealment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully identifying the key points, the members of the Cardinal Missions agreed with each other and left the Grand Hall to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their figures disappeared in the Great Hall of Light, Pope Benedict III still stood there, looking at the door with a faint gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘嫉妒’ the devil? Lucian just opened, and Natasha and Silvia, who were entangled in the bed, stood up, one regardless of the whole body, standing in front of the chest, leaning against each other in a delicate and shy manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
