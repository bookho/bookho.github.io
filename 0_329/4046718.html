			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Royal Palace of the Holy Heilz Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolf II also saw through the intelligence channel that the Magic Council did not deliberately keep the "Quantum Mechanics and the Foundation of New Alchemy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "Amazing" of the Sun King Underground Palace, he has been paying attention to the research status of the Magic Council, benefiting a lot, naturally will not let go of this micro The most profound law in the field, even if it is only an interpretation - anyway, he is now a knight caster, without a cognitive world, not afraid of collapse and destruction, of course, the result of the magic parliament research can not Directly bring him improvement, can only touch the road to find out his own path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awful! Is the essence of the world a scorpion? Determinism cannot be established, and all initial conditions cannot strictly yield the only result? Many processes are irreversible. "Even if the memory is not complete again, Rudolf II has a deep-rooted recognition of "determinism". This is the crystallization of his own experience and wisdom, so he couldn't help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his in-depth reading of the thesis, the expression suddenly became wonderful, and suddenly, the body was distorted, and it seemed to be everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pervasive cloud collapsed, Rudolph II returned to normal, confusingly said: "Quantum superposition state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although as a method of studying the mysteries of ancient devils and gods, he found a way to become such a state, but he was only able to apply it, never knowing himself. What is the state and the theoretical basis, so this road has a lot of dangers, and it depends on a little luck to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rosie Evans's inspiration from the immortal martyrdom, the mystery of the gods and the mysteries of the microcosm?" Rudolf II Concealingly, this paper is exactly what he is most eager to hope for, but there is no other strong evidence to prove it, and there is no follow-up development, which makes him anxious for a moment. "Luxien Evans will not put more The content of the quantum superposition is hidden. After all, is this the secret of the god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the determinism in his mind has been bleak, his state It is powerful to explain a lot of things: "It seems that determinism belongs to the essence of the macroscopic world. To put itself into a quantum superposition state is equivalent to entering the microscopic field, so that it can get rid of the determinism and become a return to the fate. The god of the class?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understood Lucian’s thesis in his own experience, and finally sighed slightly: "More experiments and phenomena are needed. Confirm, can't blindly believe, otherwise change accordingly After the road proved to be wrong, the trouble is big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the "Atomic Universe", Lucien looked at the vast starry sky outside the window, and there was a stack of thick papers on the table with the words "The power of the mind? The power of faith? The convergence of special electromagnetic waves?" And symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is some of his vague ideas from his research on the false gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinocchi’s voice suddenly sounded: “Master, Lord Douglas and Fernando, come to visit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lucien slammed back and took the papers on the table and hid them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando still wears his bright red magic robe. When he meets, he asks: "The quantum superposition you describe is from the immortal martyrdom and the kind." Inspiration for the state?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They apparently associate this with their calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien in these three papers not only describes the probability cloud, but also puts the concept of the more super-existing quantum superposition state, by the way To explain some experimental phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was inspiration from this." Lucien "confidently" admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, while led by Lucien to the small living room, said: "But this is close to the state of the gods, how can the microscopic particles of electrons have? Simple analogies and associations are not appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“When I was dealing with a large amount of experimental data, I thought that introducing this state can solve the problem well when I think about the interpretation of the wave function. So I introduced it. This is a bold assumption. Next, we must use a rigorous experiment to carefully verify. "Lu Xien said with a gentle attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando slightly decapitated: "I turned over my experimental record, maybe probabilistic interpretation is a direction, but probabilistic surnames and uncertain surnames should not be electronic The guilt is a surname, but there should be external reasons. There must be something that leads to the uncertainty of electronic and probabilistic cloud states. As a result, the quantum state disappears during the transition from the microcosm to the macrocosm. Finding these reasons can help We are in a state of better than Bitanos and Viken, and they have no hidden dangers and defects to promote the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experimentalism, the probability interpretation is obvious It is the best theory at present, but Fernando judges from the classical law of causality, and there are bound to be corresponding reasons for the probability cloud and the uncertain surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least so far, there is no indication that they can only be described as the essence of the electronic family name." Lucien Wenvenya insisted on authenticity, " In other words, in the current study, there is no experimental result supporting any external cause. If it is not necessary, do not add an entity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gave him a glance It is hard to imagine his stubborn feeling: "You can boldly assume that a more broad theory is included, and then carefully confirm that you have forgotten this point? Otherwise how to explain the difference between the micro world and the macro world, how to describe this The transition, how do you interpret the reasons for the collapse of the wave function?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, I have an opinion on the uncertain surname, and designed a thought experiment to falsify him." Douglas Quietly listening to the two people's arguments, suddenly opened the way, then took out the pen and paper, drew an experimental reference picture to illustrate, inside through the method of detour, in the determination of the electronic position, calculated its momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has obviously seen this experiment, his eyes focused on it and he has a great pressure to look at Lucien, waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the experiment, which is different from the classic experiment in his soul library, but the principle is similar, so after carefully watching it for a while: "His Lord, the change in quality will lead to other changes in the gravitational field, you have not considered this factor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas and Fernando have been watching Lucien After hearing this sentence, my eyes were focused on the experimental paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Douglas was slightly bitter: "I have forgotten the general theory of relativity I have been studying since this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he disappeared bitterly and remained as firm as ever: "I still believe that your quantum mechanics is incomplete, otherwise there will be great problems, at least you have not considered how the microcosm transitions. To the macro world, and this may be the secret of the gods, the secret of immortality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obvious, the micro-world's strange scenes are not mapped to the macro world That means there must be an intrinsic factor related to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando converges on his temper, low voice: "I will ask how to explain the assumption that the wave function collapses..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the experiment and the immortal martyrdom make them no longer so repulsive to the probabilistic interpretation and the wave-particle two-image surname, and turn to find the place where Lucian's theory is incomplete, trying to explain everything from a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion, Douglas and Fernando left at the same time, their high and short stature, a leisurely and eager and fast pace, seems to show a trace of tragic breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha walked in from another small room in the small living room and sighed slightly: "His Lord and Fernando are really persistent, and can be said to be stubborn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessarily stubborn, maybe they are sticking to the truth..." Lucien said inexplicably, making Natasha puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the effectiveness of the "Amortal Ramp" report, Brooke, Hathaway, Oliver, etc. have slightly changed their attitudes, no longer contradicting the quantum superposition state and the probability cloud. Rather, it tries to prove the incompleteness of Lucien's current theory, and proves that according to Lucien's current interpretation, the arcane world and the real world will have big problems! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
