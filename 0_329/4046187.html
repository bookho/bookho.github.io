			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright sunshine, slightly damp air, if there is no fish smell, and retro and elegant architecture, the crowds of people are the way Sean’s first impression of Padre Harbour, the largest seaside city in the Holm Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several carriages drove slowly and slowly across the street, and Lucien looked away from the window and looked back at the magician Lazar who was responsible for welcoming himself and the apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Evans, are you satisfied with Holm Kingdom?" Lazar asked with a smile like his own sunshine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not have the kind of ubiquitous repression at this time, very relaxed, humorously replied: "Ms., ladies are very beautiful, their The costumes are also very different from the mainland style. There are complicated cake skirts, light dresses, bright colors, beautiful lace and ruffles, folds, etc. But what disappoints me is that they seem a bit conservative. The clothes are all high-necked, only a white neck is exposed. Right, Lazar, you call me Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha Evans, this is something you don't appreciate." Lazar gave a laugh that men understand. "I always think that conservatism and concealment can give people a greater desire to explore. People's days are so easy to get things. I don’t know how to cherish.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly: “But what impressed me the most is that the Holm Kingdom, like men and women, seems to like it. Wearing a hat?" This is very rare in Aalto, often only a cleric And on Mr. older only like to wear soft cap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you observe very carefully, this is a good quality that a magician needs. In Holm, wearing a hat is a courtesy. In the future, you also need to get used to it. For example, ladies' formal hats are wide-brimmed hats with beautiful long ribbons and tassels behind their heads, and silk hats with crepe veil. They are usually small soft caps with feathers and flowers. The hats are much simpler. The general civilians wear dome hats and wide-brimmed hats. Our gentlemen are hats of varying heights and unusual soft hats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lazar refers to the top of his head, "Of course, tie, bow tie, suit or double-breasted dress is also an indispensable match.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the dialogue between men to close the distance with Lazar, Lucien transferred the topic without revealing the trace: "I don't know what restrictions on the magic of the magician in the Kingdom of Holm? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like a sword. If you hurt someone, you will be punished by the law, but the formal magician has the same status as the Lord. Less serious things only need to pay a certain fine. As for the other, you look there. Lazar pointed at the window.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned and looked around, saw a fountain next to a square, with dozens of children around A middle-aged man in a gray suit. He held his black hat in his hand and then kept picking things out from it, flowers, bread, stones, etc. Finally, he flew out a group of white pigeons, which made the children happy. Applause and cheers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic tricks, magic apprentices? "Because of the far distance, Lucien asked with a puzzled question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar sipped his mouth and smiled and nodded: "Yes, since the parliament began After the school education of apprentices, the number of magic apprentices in several countries is growing rapidly, and more and more people cannot become formal magicians. But they all know the words, they have a wealth of knowledge, and it is easy to get a good life. This apprentice should just like children and like to tease them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange to know from the Astall and Tom’s mouth that there is a magic school in the parliament, and I’m surprised, “I’m currently a magic apprentice in a magic school.” What is the proportion of promotion to the official magician? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" has improved a lot more than the ancient heritage. In the ancient magical empire, there is no strong spiritual power to rely on pharmacy and various dangerous magic rituals. Often, none of the thousands of apprentices can enter the magician. Now, with the learning of arcane, the spiritual requirements of the apprentices have been reduced a lot. About five of the 100 apprentices can become formal magicians. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar smiled at Lucien with a smile: "But this is not Evans. You have to worry. You are already a formal magician. A lot of apprentices. Just take your heart and learn the arcane without any prejudice. I believe that after a year or two you are a qualified true magician. By the way, what is the faction's magician? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I happen to be the Elemental Master, a member of the 'Elemental Will'. Have you heard of the 'Elemental Will'?" Lazar took the red wine glass that was hollowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I’ve heard that I now have a Holm crown ring, and Lussien smiles and replies with a smile: “Listen to Mr. Astar’s mention. Do you want to invite me to join Lazar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Evans, you want more." Lazar ridiculed: "we and" The pale hand's kind of organization that absorbs both good and bad, and those who can join the 'element will' are all tested elite magicians, at least need to have a formal arcane level. Hey, 'Pale hand' they It is true that there is no need to identify good or bad. Anyway, what is important to them is the body. If it is not good enough, there is a body that can come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi Listening to Lazar's smashing, I can only silently think that "Elemental Will" and "Pale Hand" are very contradictory. Even Lazar, who is obviously not a middle-level magician, can't help each other. Sneer: "So, do you have a formal arcane rank in Lazar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne wanted to say, "So, Lazar, are you an elite magician?" But think about the irony, so I changed the level of the Arcanist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard’s back is quite a bit, stop the right hand of the red wine cup and try to make his smile flat: “I am a first-class element that I improved earlier this year. The magic 'Lazar's Burning Hand' was assessed by the Parliament's Arcane Review Committee, earning two Arcane points, plus the previous eight, and finally became a First-Class Arcanist and Second Ring Magician. It was absorbed by the 'Elemental Will' as a member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he tried his best to cover up, the tone and description clearly revealed the feeling of self-satisfaction and satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazar you don't look old?" Lucien didn't understand how hard the Arcane points were for the first-class magicians, just a little Surprised Lazar's second ring magician level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar took the red wine bottle on the fixed wooden table between the two, and poured a little red wine into his cup again: "I just turned twenty-two Years old, huh, huh, you are two years older than Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the temperament is calm, not too young, often misunderstood as being about twenty years old, Lucien Also, I will report my age as 20 years old, and 18-year-old musician Lu Xien? Evans difference: "You are a great genius in Lazar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, nothing, I am still too far away from those real geniuses. For example, Mr. Ulysses in the 'Elemental Will' has an incredible talent in the field of elemental magic. At the age of 22, he has become a second-class arcian, a middle-level magician, and currently three. At the age of thirteen, he is a four-level arcane master and a five-ring element mage. And the same genius as him, there are many, like the Larry and Timothy in the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar has not had much embarrassment about these geniuses, because they have long been destroyed by their achievements. It’s not a grade, it’s not a character to compare, no need to be embarrassed, “and the genius that I admire most in the field of elemental magic, except for the great Arcanian Lord Hathaway, is the Princess of the Holm Kingdom, Ms. Meredith. At the age of twenty-three, she won the 'Holm Crown' award, and she was also a rare genius with a level of arcane level since the establishment of the Magic Council. After winning the prize, she was only a ring elemental mage, she turned out to be a fourth-level arcane. Master, unfortunately..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched the "谟" ring in his pocket, Lucien had the feeling of hearing an acquaintance in a foreign country:" The story of Ms. Meredith I know, except for the final choice, people are sincerely admired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar shakes the glass and looks transparent The blood red liquid in the glass is rippling, and the smile is more and more splendid: "As a member of the will of the element, I replaced Erics, who passed away, thank you Evans for your admiration. Oh, although we have not invited Evans to join you, But one can learn ancient magic in The genius who became a formal magician before the age of ten, I think no organization will refuse to observe you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding elements will besides the mid-level, high-level magician Guidance, numerous arcane research materials, complete laboratories, sufficient materials and wealth, you may also get advanced rituals of two legendary magic professions, one is the 'element shared with the parliament, Holm Royal Magic Court The dominator's, one is to learn the alchemy and elemental systems at the same time, and is our unique 'creator'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
