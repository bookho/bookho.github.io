			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is already quiet. Due to the appearance of the stranger Lucian, some magicians and apprentices are vigilantly checking around and worrying about being ambushed by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold sight of other magicians, in the eyes of most magic apprentices or curious or excited or bloodthirsty, the fats of the fat man and others In the eyes of the opening ceremony, Lucien quietly took out an invitation: "I am a guest invited by Viscount Kareldia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; See Lucien plainly and calmly say the reason, leading the mummy-like old man's face to ease a little, indicating that the magic apprentice next to the invitation letter and unfolding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall black hat is a little tilted, like a raised corner of the mouth, giving a strange sense of humor, the leader of the old man glanced and looked around Magician: "This invitation was not sent by me. What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magicians looked at the invitations of the apprentices on their chests, one after another Shaking his head: "Not the invitations we sent out, the marks are completely different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is pulling the same facial muscles as the mummies: "This gentleman, Your invitation is really not from someone else, but you can't prove that it was sent by the Viscount Kareldia. To ensure everyone's safety, let's wait for the confirmation of Viscount Kareldia and Ned Butler? I can call me Sethi, a four-ring magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this mysterious magician, Sethi is always a little jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sethi, as a guest who takes the liberty to participate, I have no opinion. You can call me ‘Professor’.” Lucien answered with a good attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habitual gloomy necromancer nodded gently: "Mr. Professor, your cooperation makes us very satisfied. Right, are you a formal magician? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dialogue and Lucian’s attitude, Sethi probably believed that he was a guest invited by Viscount Kareldia, so he asked the other person’s Identity, to determine your own attitude. Apprentices and formal magicians are completely different levels of characters. However, in the case of a stranger, he is not good at directly inquiring about the other's level, only to ask vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Lucien answered in a concise manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of Sethi and other necromancers has become more moderate and polite: "I hope that you can exchange magic knowledge with the professor at the banquet."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t doubt that Lucien is a fake, because the magical knowledge of the formal magician and the apprentice is different, and it’s obvious that two sentences can be seen, so this At least one guest with sufficient strength and status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic apprentices such as "fat" and "bread" are a bit surprised. The professor who had been kindly talking to himself and others was actually a formal magician. ? ! His attitude towards apprentices is completely different from the arrogant and sinister magician adults! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I am not a Necromancer." Lucien did not hide this, although he had read the book of the Necromancer, on the human body structure. I also know better, but I am used to relying on the knowledge of my last generation to resolve the soul and the consciousness can not get reasonable assumptions. In the case of the undead, the apprentices are no different from the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the book of the Book of Necromancer, whether it is meditation or magical learning, it takes time to contact the rotting corpse, etc., it is easy to infect itself. Terrible toxins and filth. In addition to relying on advanced resistance, there are only a few agents that can be treated. Therefore, Lucien, who has studied in the book of Astrology and Elements, has not ventured to learn the book of The Book of Necromancer, only transcribed. Several require a less disgusting analysis of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the seyi mummies is once again surprised: "You are not a Necromancer adventure to take part in the death feast? Want to exchange materials and items? Learn a few A Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Necromancers and apprentices also find it a bit strange, and the magicians who specialize in the Necromancer are often rejected by their peers. I feel that they are dirty, stinking and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucian answered, the castle door made a heavy rubbing sound, and the ritual Need housekeeper appeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since it was invited by the Viscount, we are relieved." Sethi represents all mages and apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nide's slightly jaw: "And the professor is also from the mainland Magic Council headquarters, is a powerful magician."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mainland magic parliament headquarters? Powerful?" Necromancers and apprentices deal with the body all the year round, more or less gloomy, even if you hear this unexpected news, just whisper Looking at Lucien in an open discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Necromancer Seyce sensitively noticed the word "also" in the mouth of Nieder’s mouth, and asked in confusion: "Why is there another one from? The magician at the headquarters of the mainland Magic Council?" He often avoids the church and seems to smell the conspiracy and struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Professor just happened to pass by." Nieder’s housekeeper said the truth that everyone did not believe, "and his strength is recognized and has been The church has included a 'purification sequence', ranked 353th."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Purification sequence?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a gloomy Necromancer, the news of this explosion surname can’t help but stir up, although it’s not clear which strong on the list of purification sequences, but they All know that the list can be on the list, all without exception, can affect or even destroy a country's high-level existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the church’s “reputation” has always been good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They looked at Lucien’s eyes and became very awed, especially when they thought about the impolite cloak, and many Necromancers were a little uneasy, they could I haven't seen a big man who has been purifying the sequence. Is this at least a high-level magician? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi did not doubt the words of Nieder’s steward, and thought about it: “Mr. Professor, please forgive us for the rudeness we have been, we have been very Longing for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that the professor in front of him and Felipe who initiated the death feast are not in harmony, and may be involved in the struggle within the Magic Council, so respect the mainland. The Magic Council apologizes for the reasons that are not sinful on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter. In fact, if you can't find strangers, I will be very disappointed." Lucien used to be a professor and can only remain strong. The tone of the person and the big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nide Butler interjected: "Mr. Professor, the host asks you to meet in the study room, Mr. Felipe is also there. Mr. Sethi, you can wait Under the guidance of the waiter, I went to the hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Lucian didn’t want to talk to Mr. Felipe in close quarters, there was no excuse for it. In this case, you can only follow the Nieder's house and go through the dark and horrible darkness to the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "Professor" is not tall, not short, not fat, not thin, but the mysterious back disappears into the darkness, the fat man can't help but whistle in his heart To the surrounding companions: "Wow, purify the sequence, it feels so cool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that one day I can also go to the list of purification sequences." The thin and tall "red wine" envy the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Necromancers and apprentices seem to have similar emotions. The “purification sequence” that the church used to remove dangerous objects became something worthy of showing off in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The castle does not know the study room on the floor, the red shirt, the black coat of the Viscount Carrendia and another man has been standing in the window Looking at what happened next, the whole process was reflected in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Mr. Professor is a less powerful magician." Viscount Kareldia sees Lucien without strength, but rules. When you come up with an invitation, you can easily evaluate it. He had a glass of red wine in his hand, leisurely and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man next to him, black hair, black nose, high nose and thin lips, handsome but full of face, black shirt with lambskin sleeves, outside A black windbreaker that is rare in a continental country seems to be so gloomy forever: "The evaluation of the church purification sequence is extremely embarrassing and very dangerous. It is impossible to judge his strength range from his acting style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
