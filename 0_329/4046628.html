			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the age of twenty-six, I completed the results of the two major changes and won the title of the Great Arcanist. I believe that no one can break the record of Lord Evans. When Brooke became an Arcanist, he was also in his forties..." Another lady, Patricia, is like a sister to Katrina. Her voice is like a nightmare, full of admiration and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina was awakened by the words of friends, with a bright and excited smile on his face: "In fact, after the introduction of 'New Alchemy', we are guessing When the teacher can become a great arcade master, the general opinion is about 30 years old, huh, huh, even according to such speculation, the teacher’s record will be amazing to the idea that it cannot catch up. Who knows, only 26 years old, Twenty-six years old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am a teacher at the age of thirteen or four, then the age difference of four or five seems to be A generation difference, so he has always been a generation, and later became his student, naturally more respectful and fearful, coupled with the mature and steady teacher, when he gets along with him, it is difficult to remember his true age - Lu Xien After the musician’s identity was exposed, the age has been changed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until today, I heard that he won the title of Archer, and he suddenly remembered that he was only twenty-six years old! I am almost twenty-two years old, and I am expected to break through to the middle-level magician. It is obviously the same generation with little difference in age. The gap is so big that I can only look at his back with admiration! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, I am a student of the Arcanist!" Heidi's mind is relatively simple and direct, and does not hide his pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome black-eyed Lanca looks at Heidi, Lei Yiya, and other people intricately, with a smile: "The Evans must have belonged to it." Your own legendary career, maybe ten years later, you are the students of the legendary magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the talent and ability of Evans, up to forty years He can promote the legendary peak." Patricia smiled and congratulated. "At that time, with his guidance and help, you must have become a high-ranking person, but we can't forget our friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Magic Council, the Arcane Master is more important than the legendary magician, because having this title means that you will basically enter the legendary field in the future, and The average magician is less obstructed, and it is easier to become a peak-level big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there is no difference now, the teacher's guidance will not change anything..." Lei Yi Li Ya is difficult to hide the truth, my heart is a belly, perhaps The collection of problems and problems will be even more mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patricia forgot to drink with black tea: "How can there be no difference? After you become a great arcane master, you will have a lot of things to do. For example, there is almost no danger of concealing missions every year; other magicians will choose you under the same conditions when exchanging items or harvesting. Sometimes, they would rather lose themselves... so the invisible benefits will fill you. Every bit of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can not change the strictness of the teacher, monthly research progress report, 'mountain' general exercises, piles of Review the paper, repeat to the boring spell practice... I think the mind is bloated." Chely licked her forehead, but fortunately, she has the moisture of love, this is not so embarrassing, after all, with Katrina, the sea Compared with them, they have a poor talent. They are not good seedlings selected by the parliament, but magic schools that depend on relationships. Therefore, they must make up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would rather suffer such a hardship." Lankae blurted out and then covered up some complex emotions with a smile. "I mean, many mages and apprentices are willing to replace you." Accepting the teachings of Lord Evans and bearing this pain, their number is enough to circle around Alin, and you must cherish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi seriously Nod: "We complain about complaining, but the effort is never too little, we can meet the teacher and become his student. It is the luckiest thing in our life. We must not squander this luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks very well." Katrina and Reyia looked at Heidi with amazement, and she was so serious that she would be so serious. time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, Heidi showed a sly smile and clenched his fist: "So, when I become a high-level magician, I have my own students." I will let them understand what is called 'lucky', what is called Evans analysis problem set, what is called difficult analysis set, no, can not just let their students 'enjoy', must be extended to magic schools, promote to many low and medium In the hands of the Arcanist! Hello everyone, it is really good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patricia has a brighter eye: "Heidi, do you want to promote the practice that Lord Evans gave you in the future? Can you let me try it first? I am very curious about the exercises that make you so afraid."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patricia has always been full of enthusiasm for the guidance they receive, but this private lecture belongs to the secrets of every teacher, and it’s easy to ask even friends that they don’t have to do it. So I have to restrain my own desires, and now, Heidi volunteers to mention that she naturally refuses to let go of the opportunity of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi thought for a moment, the teacher said that he would organize these exercises into formal book promotion in the future, so he smiled and said: "Do you want to try? I But it is very strict and must be completed on time and in volume!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really can try? No matter how strict, I am willing!" Patricia was pleasantly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanka followed and said, "Can I try it too?" Her voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other women also expressed the same desire, and Katrina and others had a strong sympathy on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I waited for Heidi to organize the initial exercises, Lanka was satisfied and said: "Why did we enter the Aalborg School of Magic, if you can get to know you soon?" Maybe life is completely different..." It won't be a formal magician until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher said that this is an era of change, who can be less constrained by past views, not limited by intuitive understanding, who can gain a lot of honors The strength has been rapidly improved, so you still have a lot of opportunities, this era has just begun." Lei Yi Liya encouraged them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patricia solemnly nodded: "His Evans is right, perhaps because of this, the last 10 years of breakthrough surname contribution is mostly Completed by the young Arcanists, Mr. Felipe, Larry, Ulysses, Yurisian, Jerome, and others who have already received the Silver Moon Medal, the highest honor in the electromagnetic field."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are just lucky. Although young people are less constrained by past experience, it is difficult to make good results without a solid foundation. Knowledge accumulation is the foundation and must not be Less.” Katrina reminded them, “Those old archeologists may change their way of thinking and their understanding of the world after digesting the results of this decade. They will spark a spark of wisdom that we cannot imagine, and we must not Despise them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The parliament decided to set up a prize for the highest honor in the field of arcane and magic, the standard will be more strict than the Holm Crown Award, the prize is Eight perfect grade items, due to getting Sponsored by Lord Evans, this award is named the Evans Prize and is divided into the Evans Arcane Award, which represents the world's laws and the mysteries of material energy, representing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Evans Arcane Award, Magic Award, Mathematical Award, Medical Award, I don't know who will get the first..." Heidi, Cherie and others looked at the magic radio, and their hearts were eager to feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Speaker of the House of Representatives today awarded Lucy on behalf of the Supreme Council Mr. Evans, the Archer of the Great Arcane, in recognition of his contribution to the changing era of the new alchemy, the tribute to him is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Radio, Nightingale The sweet voice, the crisp sound of the Lark, other anchors or magnetic surnames, or honest, or old voices, repeatedly read the news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History The youngest arcanist, perhaps the youngest legendary magician..." Gaston, who has deep yellow and eccentric eyes, broke the strange silence in the study and sighed softly. "Who can think of the one I met that year?" Will the ring magician become a great arcian? When I confirmed the periodic table of elements, I just appreciated his potential and thought that he would hope to become a high-level magician in the future. Oh, as a result, my arcane and magic were upgraded by one level, and he was completely different from the past. The eighth arcanist, Lord Evans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight years, for a high-level magician, just like ordinary The year of man.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry sitting across from him, helplessly smiled: "A few years ago, I was very envious of him, even in private. But now, no matter whether envy or jealousy is completely gone, I am looking for the wrong goal. We are not a level of competitors at all. I can’t even see his back, only deep sigh. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
