			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, people are coming together." Urisian, who is black and brown, counts the personnel according to the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard him, Exxon showed a slight smile and turned to look at Lucien: "His Evans, Lord Forman, can leave "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the polluted elves, when he thinks of the dozens of compatriots who have fallen and demonized, he will be so anxious that he will not restrain himself. Emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien originally wanted to look at Atlante and confirm his thoughts. After turning around, he only saw a pair of tightly closed eyes. Suddenly shook his head and laughed, and Natasha’s low laughter sounded in her ear. She noticed the situation of Lucien, and habits and experience inevitably made people make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Atlante, do you have anything else?" Lucien asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante nodded slightly, smiled and amiable: "Nothing else, this time I mainly assist you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellersting breathed a sigh of relief, just about to talk, suddenly felt a dizzy mind, the surrounding color faded, leaving only the most intense darkness, then she saw the vast starry sky, just the stars No longer embarrassing, but emitting different radiances like various elements, including silver, gold, green, and deep red...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universe..." The name emerged in her heart, and the middle and high-level magicians outside Heidi and others all whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s face was as pale as ever, his eyebrows were slightly wrinkled, and he seemed to endure the stun of the space jump. He put his hands in the black long trench coat pocket and his back was quite Straight, my head raised a little, my eyes looked deep and surrounded by the elements of the planet, I don't know what I was thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin’s discomfort is still resolved in the future, suddenly seeing the speed of the elemental planet’s rotation speeding up, marking the mysterious trajectory, and becoming a strange and strange symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw this symbol, her eyes were again dizzy, and I could no longer clearly feel the surrounding situation. There was a long and dark tunnel. The strange illusion of walking through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such awkward state, Ellerd did not know how long the time had passed, and her eyes flashed brightly, and she stabbed her eyes slightly, her head. Dizzy, as if vomiting at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the edge of Stroop Forest, please lead us to the 'Natural Residence'." Lucien's mellow voice seems to have crossed countless worlds. It was introduced into the ear of Ellerd, and it was ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural Residence" is a powerful lock for the elves, and is also used to refer to the elves in the Stroop Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin shook his head, trying to get rid of dizziness, but suddenly saw a beautiful but full of heroic face, silver-purple clear eyes with a faint smile In the palm of your hand, the palm of your hand is holding a thumb-sized fruit that flows with waves of light: "The fruit of the speciality of the Kingdom of Holga, which grows only on the banks of the Chilgea, which is only a few tens of kilometers long, can be quickly calmed down. Dizziness caused by space transfer, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayerstin took the fruit and put it in the mouth, suddenly feeling the cool, sweet and sour taste, the mind is Clearly: "Thank you, Her Majesty the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can she not know the Queen of Holm Kingdom, the wife of Lord Evans as a diplomat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and said: "In fact, it’s okay to get used to it. Space jumping is not so terrible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head to the side of Xi'an, secretly using the long-established mind connection and laughing: "The princess of the elves is so weak? Princesses like me are really rare."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't look at her strength?" Lucien was satisfied with his wife's continued conversation with Ellers without "gentlemanly manner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha proudly said: "I went to the Kingdom of Holm when I was a child, but the 'Elemental Paradise' passed, not as unbearable as her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few breaths, Ellersteen recovered completely and found that the wizards of the Magic Council had already woke up through all sorts of weird means, so they showed an elegant and courteous smile: "Please follow me to the 'natural residence'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came through the natural magic of Grand Druid Malfurion, the space vertigo is relatively less serious - not all legends have a half-plane The priest of the Holy Spirit did not, most of the epic knights did not, the great druids did not, but the legendary magicians and those who occupy a certain semi-positional or heterosexual space of a certain surname, such as "sacrum "The Wasteland" of Apsis, "Silent Hell" of Tiffidis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, their half-plane is generally considered to be the Lord of Hell or the abyss will give, in which the battle has the effect of field bonus, and the strength is half-order. To the first order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a space jump based on a half-plane?" Exxon followed her sister and felt that she was only dizzy for a while, but she was already familiar with it. Kindly Strup Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot weather in June could not find a trace in the forest of Stroop, the breeze coming through the leaves with the unique fragrance and coolness of the forest , sent a sweet bird song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the crystal dragon Afris puppies walked in the forefront of the team, looking around, the focus of attention made Yurisian the battle mage and the inside The committee members of the disciplinary personnel have sighed from the sigh, so it is too careful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Affris, what are you looking for?" Heidi is very fond of the "magic pet" of Little Crystal, and has a very good relationship with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite Detective-like looks at the forest, the dragon's breath exudes no creatures within a few kilometers to dare to move, the voice is tender but serious: " I remember a magician found a gem mine in the forest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s obviously not here..." Katrina couldn’t help but remind it of normal nature. Geographical knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris is not discouraged: "There is a lot of natural gifts in the place where the elves live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is just to think of this point and then come to Lucien, and Lucien considers that a small number of elves hate humans, but they are not disgusted with the dragon, and its illusion is outstanding, so it agrees with its pleading. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylestin looked at this little guy with only translucent crystal scales, blaming it on its dragon name, but for its upstart The dress couldn’t help but shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small crystal has a shining ring on the front paws, and the chest is hung with several gold medals. There are silver moons representing the highest honor. Medals, etc., also have items borrowed from the accompanying products of the Lucian Alchemy Experiment, because they must be returned in the future, so it is worn on the body at any time, and it is difficult to share the feelings with them. - Do it for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien space is not far from the "natural residence" when jumping over, so under the guidance of the two elves, "Magic Council and Holm It took a long time for the joint delegation of the kingdom to see a place covered by a mist. In the middle of it, the woods are soaring and towering. Under the guidance of magical power, the branches they grow form a tree in the air. The house, the central lake is as gentle as a gem, surrounded by flowers and fruits, is a place to live, but also natural! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beautiful..." Heidi, Katrina and other girls have no resistance to the beautiful environment, they have been praised, even Felipe and other gloomy The magician, after witnessing this fairytale "natural residence", also has the feeling of being quiet and the mind is wiped clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the dark-colored skin of the old elf Malfurion took a wooden stick like an uncut, and came out of the mist, behind Follow a lot of elves with different skin color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you, distinguished guest." Malfurion said on behalf of Elf Wang Ting, "Please allow me to be rude, but the damage done by the elf tree makes every An elf is suffering, please also Evans, Forman, Natasha, you go with me to the center of the lake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our purpose." Lucien can understand the importance of the Elf tree to the Elf family, and also thinks about whether or not to change a precious fruit to go back, so that with the old spring, you can let yourself and Natasha hold the best life-long legendary ceremony. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
