			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road was a little numb, and Lucien looked at the wall on the left, and it took a few seconds to react, then walked to the wall and slammed against it. The position of the sound, lowering the voice: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adam living next to you. Dude, have we just met before?" The sound of the low magnetic name sounded, and the stone brick in that position suddenly moved and sagged in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the friction of the sand, the stone bricks were magically taken down, revealing a hollow and a pair of deep blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no magic array protection?" Lucien learned that Natasha picked the left eyebrow and asked with a slight surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a magic tower of at least a high-level magician, the walls are not reinforced and soundproofed by magical arrays, and here is still a cell, even the basic prevention of damage No ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah's well-defined face has a smile: "Because it is a demon's land! Although there are many veins and horror magic in the vicinity and in the forest. Creatures, but the variety is serious and very dangerous. The ability to build a magic tower is already a powerful and rich expression of the old witch. Therefore, this magic tower has constant magic array protection in addition to the outer and core places. It’s an ordinary building. Hey, man, I’ve said so much, I don’t know what to call you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have not communicated with normal people for a long time. If you have a stomach, it is not as hard as the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Adam, you can call me Lucien. Right, how did you dig this stone?" Lucien used to keep his name. courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam looked through the empty eyes and looked at Lucien’s eyes and said: "It’s a polite, oh, man, you are a magician. Or is it a knight? Is it a low-level, or a middle-level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magician, Intermediate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard Lucian's concise answer, Adam smiled and said: "I said folks, we are all experimental materials, why should we be so cautious? Just call me Adam, the dark blood of the great knight Adam."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he stretched out his right hand, and the nails that had not been trimmed for a long time flashed with sharp cold. "I used the nails to slowly dig the stone bricks. The shackles can suppress my blood. Strength, but it can't make the body that I have changed back to the original appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked down at his clean-cut nails. Humorously: "If there is no old witch here, just an ordinary guard guard, then we can successfully escape from prison by nails. Adam, Do you know the situation nearby? Also, do you know what the old witch is doing? After I fainted in the dark mountains, I woke up in the cell and didn't know anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement of Adam’s long-term communication with others has slowly subsided, and the tone has become dignified: “Man, knowing the situation is useless. There are two cities and many villages within the Magic Tower’s defense. The people inside should be descendants of human beings trapped in the land of demons for many years - it is said that a village on the edge of a dark mountain range has been swallowed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "After encircling this area, it is a huge forest similar to the dark mountains. It is very dangerous. There are powerful dark creatures such as scarlet tree, killing vine, three-armed monster, feather snake, petrified lizard. When I first landed in the Devil's Land, I was there. I almost couldn't get out of the forest. I don't know what else is in the forest. According to the law of the more monsters going to the outside world, I am afraid that there will be Chimera and prisoners. Soul, Sphinx, Giant . And other top biological "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He concluded in accordance with the kind of dark mountains had appeared in the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After introducing the surrounding situation, Adam’s voice is getting lower and lower: “There is an ancient relic under the magic tower, which seems to be related to the secret of the imprisoned land. Old witch I have been trying to crack it to find a way out of here, but limited to the strength of only seven or eight rings, always can not succeed, so most of her experiments are how to use limited resources to enhance the magic power."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, she was contaminated in the soul and body in a magical experiment accident, and she could no longer transform her youthful appearance. Life is rushing, so she is still looking for a solution to this problem. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam said with deep fear: "The old witch's soul is polluted. After changing a few girls' bodies, they can't restrain themselves from aging. It's hard to keep for a minute, so she thinks the core of the problem is in the soul. I want to try to split. The soul divides the unpolluted part and completely disconnects it from the original soul, so that pollution cannot be eradicated, and then grow and become another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucian has swallowed a bit of difficulty: "Who is listening to who is directed after the split? Who is the old witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to Sean In terms of knowledge, there is no real soul segmentation experiment so far, even if the part of the soul that is hidden in the sorcerer's transformation and the finger of the life hiding is not completely disconnected from the original soul and body. Contact is also associated in some magical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how far apart, only when the soul of the body dies, the soul within the life will be resurrected, there will be no philosophical and cognitive conflicts, and If you encounter an attack that can interfere with this connection, the resurrected soul will also bring the same injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam smiled and blinked: "Who knows? Anyway, the buddies who were separated by the old witch all died on the spot, and the soul dissipated, without exception." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the wall behind the road to Sean: "The guy in the cell will accept the experiment tonight, if he does not come back, it means The experiment failed again. If the experiment is successful, maybe we can get free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the experiment is successful..." Lucien repeated it again, did not say Going on, just thinking in the heart, and then with the cloning technology, perhaps means that there is a path of eternal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current magical results, even if it is perfectly transformed into a lich or otherwise prolonged life, the soul will inevitably show signs of decay over time. And if the part that has not yet begun to age is still affected, the legendary magician who has lived the longest in the Magic Council record is 6,490 years old, and the rest will die before this age, or Inexplicably missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam lowered the voice again: "Man, I have to remind you that you have to prepare early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?" Lucien looked up at the wall missing a stone brick, opposite Adam's dark blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old witch thinks that the reason for the experiment failure is that the soul for her experiment is not strong enough, so your rare middle-level magician will definitely become this experiment. The main material. But before that, she will definitely try to improve your soul strength. For you, it is both a danger and an opportunity." The low voice of Adam's magnetic name brought Lucy a bad one. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a deep breath and gently squeezed his head: "I will look for opportunities. Adam, can you tell me the internal structure of the magic tower you know?" For example, where is the energy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, any need for help can come to me." Adam replied boldly, his eyes slightly picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exchange, I was afraid that the servants would find that Adam had put the stone bricks back into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien silently walked back to the bed and sat down, looking for an escape method for Adam, and he was not mindful when he was hiding behind him, because How, I will try hard to get some information from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dinner sent by the servant, Lucien took the time to sleep and restore his strength, and then he should find a way to lift the ban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the middle of the night, the iron gate was suddenly opened, and the red-faced young servant coldly and coldly turned to sit on the road and said: "The master told me I will take you to the moonlight, which will help your body and soul recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I immediately thought of the words of "Let the wind", but went out The opportunity, Lu Xien would refuse, and soon followed the young servant to the terrace where the magic tower protruded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver moon hangs high, and the radiance of the cold is no different from the outside world. After shining on the terrace, it reflects a silvery shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
