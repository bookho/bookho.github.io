			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting darker, Larry has been studying Lucian’s paper intently, and after the conflict in his heart disappears, he found that this paper brought himself a very Great inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and now, what I want to explain is that here may be a problem with determinism, some processes are probabilistic and irreversible..." Repeatedly chanting this sentence, Larry frowned and said to himself, "If there is no strict law, the real world should be so chaotic and disorderly, but it is not true, it is not right, sometimes, many things. It is completely chaotic and difficult to predict."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, don't think about this problem first, and don't extend the magical fantasy theory of microscopic field to macroscopically. The world, even if it is established in the microscopic field, I believe that there are other factors in the process of extension that cause the wave function to collapse and let the result be determined." Larry whispered a curse and decided to evaluate the paper only in the microscopic field. Otherwise, he feels that his head will explode and his outlook on life and world will collapse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this seems to contradict reality, you can’t always be a ubiquitous probability wave? Can it appear in the lab, the elemental headquarters and the Allinge Magic Tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time does not know how long it has been. Larry has come up with all his experimental records and research papers in the microscopic field, carefully interpreting from probability, uncertainty and complementarity. From the perspective of the principle, they reconstructed the contents of the new alchemy and quantum mechanics. The results are somewhat unacceptable in his expectation. This is the most logically self-consistent theoretical interpretation of the experimental data, which can be solved before. Some problems solved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the sky was bright, Larry picked up the quill, and after a moment of deliberation wrote: "...at least in the microscopic field, the current all Magic experiments can't prove that Evans's probability interpretation is wrong, and it solves the problem of the interpretation of Oliver's wave function..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The principle of complementary surnames also unifies the particle surnames and fluctuating surnames of electrons from the height of philosophy, allowing us to more realistically 'see' the wonders of the microscopic field... the uncertainty principle is the surname of the particle Or observing the phenomenon caused by it, we have to prove it by designing a magic experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t think much about what factors make the micro-domain probability surname And uncertain surnames can't affect the macro world, because that might introduce conditions that have never been considered in the past, never discovered conditions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe these factors or conditions are the essence of the soul? The essence of magic? The reason why magic patterns can cause magic effects..." After writing the comments, Larry is caught in an endless divergent thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, a new generation of high-level arcaneists who grew up in the new alchemy wave began to work with old-age magic including many arcane masters. The division stood on the opposite side, and the torrent of change made them unable to think more and could only advance on their own arcane instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Dieppe, who successfully entered the audit committee by relying on the first Evans Arcane Award, also saw Lucien’s three-in-one quantum mechanics There is a similar reaction to the New Alchemy Foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once thought that he could think of the microscopic particle "wave-particle two-image surname" himself is an arcane master who is really good at whimsy, and is an open-minded representative. After seeing this paper, he felt that his imagination could not keep up with the rhythm, whether it was the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function, or the unacceptable ubiquitous probability cloud, or how it could not be determined at the same time. Both arcane quantities are beyond their imagination and beyond their own cognitive range! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a subversive challenge to determinism, at least in the microscopic realm!" Dieppe feels inexplicable in shock and subconscious rejection. The excitement is like being a warrior who challenges the old order, just like the countless epic heroes who buried the magical empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the charge echoes the tragic sound of the collapse of the old times and the hope of the new era! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of imagination made him a little bit excited, and he was afraid and eager, just like the "wave-particle two-image surname" that originally proposed microscopic particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this lead to the reconstruction of the entire arcane system? Will this open a new chapter in the parliament?" He muttered, slightly mad I read it and tried to understand the content of Lucian's thesis from every angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't consider how the microcosm transitions to the macro world, then this Evans paper containing three theories is definitely the best and most suitable for the micro-field's 'relative truth', even if I think it is ridiculous, I have to Admitted, a large amount of experimental data indicates this truth. I suggest that all arcans should first study the new alchemy according to its interpretation without being able to falsify it, but don't be busy building your own cognitive world... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the falsification process of these three basic theories will bring about a flourishing development in the micro-domain, no matter what the final proof is. Whether they are right or wrong, the process itself is a process of harvesting, the process of development..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing the results of the assessment, Dieppe first felt To the torrent of the times, it makes people want to jump into it, let the era leave its own brand, so that you can choose the road of arcane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the tower, ask the "Prophet" for several days in a row Nesika and Samantha looked at the papers in their hands, and the "Prophet" Bergna went to the side of the tower, looked at the buildings that were as small as ants, and looked at the stars in the sky, sighing. Road: "Sure enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the hunch, the subversion of the theoretical basis of the entire astrology system has come to an impact! Lucien? After ruining one old theory after another, Evans finally stared at one of the most fundamental things in the current arcane and magic system, determinism! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he disguised the value and meaning of exploration in disguise, because no matter how hard you try, you can't determine the position and momentum of the electron at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesika was awakened by the sigh of the "Prophet" and said: "This is ridiculous and ridiculous, and it is just an interpretation without a theoretical basis." , completely contradictory interpretation of the macro world! I believe and believe that the world has an essential law, it strictly controls everything, this is our goal and motivation to explore the Arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also have stubborn persistence in determinism, but I can't let this persistence react to my own arcane attitude. Maybe when Lu Sian got an experiment to prove, so we The most important thing to do now is to design the magic to verify it. Before that, blind adherence and belief are not advisable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Prophet" corrected Nesika’s attitude, “Of course, I also believe that even if Lucien can use experiments to prove probabilistic interpretation, probability clouds, quantum superposition states and uncertainty principles, it must have overlooked why they are so, without considering another Influencing factors, otherwise Our world is not what it is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha nodded lightly, his eyes lost some focal length: "I can't imagine a company that is uncertain about itself. What is the world of probability..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wave of the second wave of the image, she once stood firmly on the side of Lucien, and now, She also firmly stood on the opposition side, nothing about the other, only in her own arcane world view, her own belief in arcane and magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nesika and Samantha left, the "Prophet" Bergner once again looked to the vast stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have an illusion, seeing the splendid old age is disintegrating and destroying at an unstoppable speed, and above its ruins, one more A new era of splendid and more magnificent has been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the heart garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first saw Lucien’s paper, Atlas of Cursing was holding the same unacceptable attitude as everyone else, in his eyes The world is clearly in line with the law of causation, reasonable, understandable, and predictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this kind of contradictory attitude, his expression gradually changed, because Lucien’s detailed description of the quantum cloud and the quantum superposition state made him inexplicably familiar. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the method of the gods given by Pope Benedict III crossed his mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
