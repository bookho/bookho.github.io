			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high tower of silver ash goes straight into the sky, the whole body is smooth lines, sparkling with cold metal luster, more than most of the high-order slightly gloomy mage tower There is an inexplicable taste, and it seems quite harmonious with the vast starry sky, which is obviously different from all current architectural styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a big musician, the magic tower is also full of art and fantasy." A few years later, Rock, who is already a three-ring magician, is still the same. Jump off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an arcane expert who is good at the astrology, the magic tower is built a little higher as an astrology is inevitable, but this shape, this color, in Aringe Numerous unique magic towers are strange, and it seems that the quiet and calm temperament of Lucien is not quite commensurate, but thinking of him as a musician, the magician invited to the banquet is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delicate Louise is very appreciative of this magic tower, at least closer to her aesthetic than the black tower and the gloomy castle, so she smiles: "Mr. Evans also seems to have a good level of architectural design. When I am remodeling a garden villa, you must give me advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the musician or the magician, Lucien is considered her "predecessor". Even though Lucien has always said that she is not so polite, she is still meticulously calling Mr. Evans, and after becoming the famous radio anchor "nightingale", she is in the second The ring magician stage is not short of money, so there is no need to buy a garden villa in the Aringe city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if Evans named this magic tower?" Samantha was indifferent, as if asked casually, normally, unless it was created In the half-plane or the headquarters of the parliament, no magician will idle the name of the magic court, except for artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and stepped on the steps: "I call it 'Babel Tower anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Babel..." Lazar, Heather and others all doubted the pronunciation repeatedly, and could not find a matching word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K wants to ask, it can be seen that Lucien laughed and said nothing, and suddenly understood that he did not want to disclose, it should belong to his own little secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome back, my master, welcome, distinguished guests, I am courageous, loyal and honest Pinocchio." Alchemy life sounds crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the slowly opening silver-gray metal gate: "This is Taling 'Pinocchio.""<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard and others who did not understand the meaning of this name smiled and shook their heads, and greeted Pinocchio, then entered the hall and saw a wheel in the center of the hall. Metal statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 'wheel of history'." Lucien introduced the statue with a bad taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humor has no world difference, and Roque is the first to laugh: "Luxion, you are ambitious, but you can propose the future of the new alchemy. How can a teacher not have ambition and confidence, whether it is the Northern Church or the Southern Church, all will be crushed by the wheel of history!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"History is tortuous, iterative However, it will eventually move forward." Lu Xien changed his description, and said with ease, with this magic tower, he can be regarded as the first real home in a different world. Here, the Magic Tower is enough to defend against a nine-ring attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha gently daggers: "Evans is more awake than I thought, I thought you were proposing a new alchemy, leading the magician to really touch the substance." After the mystery, you will become a little more proud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, although the special supplement of the "Arcane" journal "New Alchemy" has not yet been released, but These deep-edged magicians of Mansa have already read this great book that can change the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading, Samantha, Rachel, Larry, Ulysses, etc. are sincerely admired and depressed, they used to Lucien is a hard-to-match opponent in the same generation of magicians. He admires him as a target, as a driving force for advancement, but when the "New Alchemy" comes out, they suddenly understand that Lucien has already with them. Not the same level of people, he belongs to the level of Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, Klaus and other legendary magicians, even the back does not let them see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at your enemy is to despise your life." Lucien looked at Samantha and smiled. "And I don't have the genius you think. I have already said that the atomic field is a brand new field. Any point here can be related to the mystery of matter. In this field, there is no authority at present, there is no difference in magical strength, as long as the experimental conditions are sufficient, you can get amazing discoveries, and I am just one step ahead, you It’s not necessarily impossible to catch up. Young is not conservative is capital.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha looked at Lucien’s deep and calm eyes and felt his seriousness instead of Polite and modest, then a smile: "Unfortunately, I am not good at the elemental field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry, K, Lazar and others are thoughtful Nodded, I used to listen to Lu Xien, and there is a sense of inspiration. But now, "New Alchemy" has been put in front of reality, this is indeed a field of "God"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the sky: "The macro world is equally important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher Can you look at your lab?" Heidi asked curiously before Samantha answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not refuse, took them to the basement with a lift, and passed the spare energy room, the restraint room, the underground magic garden, and arrived at the vast experiment. room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most magical arrays, alchemy installations, have been seen by everyone, in the middle of the lab, placed in two strong silver semi-circular metals in the strong magnetic vacuum magic array The box made them feel a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two metal boxes engraved with magical patterns, the shape and the entire magic tower seem to have similar places, also exudes inexplicable taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the electromagnetic cyclotron...If you want to build, you can redeem the design proposal that I submitted." Lucian probably talked about the principle, no trace Tempted them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic tower far beyond the budget has a special inclination of the parliament, many higher materials are cheaper to the level of medium materials, but Lucien will still be three years The savings, along with the rewards of alchemy, have made it a lot easier to upgrade the Magic Tower in the future, and now you need Arcane points to replenish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lucien have to feel that he is promoted too fast, even if there are many money-making projects, there are many rewards for the Arcane points, and they can live with those who have lived for hundreds of years. There is still a gap between the high-level magicians, especially the magic tower itself is the best, and there are more than the ordinary high-order and current needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Larry looked at the electromagnetic cyclotron with great enthusiasm, then pointed to the sealed box connected to the transmitter, which seemed to be hot. A lot of magical arrays in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the observation device above and recorded the magic array: "This is the auxiliary alchemy device I designed, called the cloud room."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cloud Room?" K's thick face reveals obvious doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "After opening the alchemy unit, there will be saturated steam inside. As long as charged particles are shot, ionization will occur to charge particles. The trajectory of the core condenses out the liquid beads, thus forming a clear trace that helps us observe and record the particle trajectory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did I not think of this!" The hot Ulysses slammed his left back, the particles were too small, and the trajectory could not be clearly observed and recorded. It was a big problem in the study of the atomic field. Many magicians were similar to the magnifying device, but Lucien Simply use the surname of supersaturated steam to solve the part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise and Heidi said at the same time: "Can you take a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi Grace nodded, turned the alchemy device on, turned on the electromagnetic cyclotron, and let them observe the situation inside through the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space is faint as if there is nothing. Suddenly, the white is like a misty airflow appearing out of thin air, the trajectory is wonderful, and under strong contrast, the beauty is shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound in the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the lab, Lucien took them into the banquet hall and waited until the high-ranking magicians such as Raven, Gaston and Isabella came to the official banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, Lucien played seven or eight piano pieces in a row, and also pulled two violin melody to make the guests feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet prelude in the past, everyone began to talk casually, Lucien looked at the full house, suddenly there was a kind of inexplicable loneliness, and some missed Aalto's friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An opportunity was found, and Lucian slipped onto the balcony and turned on electromagnetic communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, congratulations on the completion of your magic tower." Natasha's smiling voice passed over in Lusien not long after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also laughed: "Good afternoon, is celebrating the banquet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately I can't participate, I can only say a congratulation, huh, huh, fallen angel, the Pope is really creative." After talking with Lucien for a long time, Natasha also learned a lot of new vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very solemn: "I am only studying particles in the microscopic field, there is no other purpose, but the result of this is not the god of truth." After the creation of the world, the authority is given to all things, only responsible for the spiritual sustenance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a better future, Lucien has been slowly changing Natasha's religious view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, what do you mean, God is in our hearts, is the church deceptive?" Natasha seems to care less, as long as Lucien does not She will not become serious if she truly speaks the words of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not hesitate: "Of course, do you think Ms. Meredith is also evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha laughed softly: "Well, this is not the point. The point is that after you mentioned that you are a fallen angel, I suddenly want to see you wearing the costume of the angel in the opera. It is best to change one." On the wings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the costumes of angels are very popular..." Lucien debunked her little thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha smiled two times with guilty conscience: "Yes, why is the quality of my conversation with Hathaway's mother-in-law now so good?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there are still many problems to be solved in the communication planet, Douglas Speaker has been deeply troubled for several years." So the plan for the constellation of artificial planets is far behind expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha snorted: "The quality of our call...I feel, you know where the problem is?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Lucien smiled without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also did not ask, but sighed: "The mysterious space appeared, and my teacher was recruited by the Pope." When I think of the legendary battlefield, I am excited, but unfortunately I have no strength to join, but the Pope has also issued an order to prepare for the Knights of the Knights and above. Once the mysterious space is strange, we will add it after leaving enough defensive power. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is such a day, I will lead them as the commander of the Vaolirit nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, either Dagong or her, there must be one person to come out, otherwise they will not be able to serve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I also want to see." Lucien is concerned about authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natashahaha smiled and said: "You still forget it. No one in the legend has a hatred with me, and the church's Holy Spirit pastor and epic knights look at it. When you get to it, you will get into trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words, Lucien as a master can not leave the guests cold, so I asked John about them. After the situation, the call is actively stopped. Just looking back, I saw Samantha look at myself from the other side, with steamed fish in his hand - this is the improved food of Lucien, which is loved by the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
