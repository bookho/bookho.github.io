			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina strives to get rid of the truth behind the power of the old witch and the faintly perceived things, and keeps a polite smile on Lucy. En: "Mr. You, is it also a legendary strongman? But none of the famous middle-level magicians meets your image."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carina, who has a good background and has become a magician, has always been a proud and confident girl, but Adam is a "legendary" outside the Magic Tower. He is strong and fierce, with prisoners who seem to equal his status. Lucien also became a legendary strongman in the eyes of Karina and others, and had to respond politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "I am just an unnamed magician, not a legendary character, and only one day earlier than you. You can Call me Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long day? Mr. Lucien, are you not ours here?" Another tall and beautiful girl, Ophelia A little surprised to see Lucien, Alva, Brad, and Carina are the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their eyes always give way to the illusion that Lucien is a rare beast in the zoo, surrounded by humans outside the iron railings, so the corners of the mouth Slightly raised: "Don't you have seen outsiders? Should the people here be descendants of outsiders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe aware of their curiosity The eyes are too hot, and Karena’s face is shy and flushed. “Sorry, Mr. Lucian, we have never seen an outsider. Although many long-established families have ancestors coming from the outside world, they are trapped here. The story of not being able to go out, but for centuries, people in cities and villages have thrived, fought with beasts around them, and war with monsters, and have grown stronger, but never met outsiders."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is laughing next to him: "In fact, there has always been, but unless a large number of people are swallowed up, a small number of outsiders will choose to hide their identity and mix into human society, such as I am, and a lot of exotic It is either killed by monsters in the forest or directly caught by old witches, such as Lucy, the unlucky guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Witch?" Rena, Alva, Ophelia and Brad almost retired from Adam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dared to directly call the owner of the Magic Tower an old witch? I am waiting for someone to dare to curse in my heart! Although he used to be tyrannical, but now he is not a prisoner, isn’t he afraid that the old witch will arrest him, punish him, or even kill him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam sees them as if they are avoiding monsters, understands that they are worried about being implicated, and smiles and spread their hands: "It doesn't matter, the old witch never cares what we say, she Only concerned about her experiments and looks, do you think they have not responded?" He is talking about the servants of several prisoners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Adam’s eyes aiming at himself and others, the red-faced servant slammed back and said: “Adam, if you discuss this, I will use a whip.狠打打你!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t dare to report to the witch as the name of “old witch”. It is said that a long time ago, a servant made a great effort to report to the witch. The experimental materials secretly called her an old witch. As a result, the witch repeated the "old witch" several times in a cold voice, and all the people who said the word were executed, whether it was a prisoner or a servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response of the servants dispelled the concerns of Karina and others, and they sighed: "Mr. Adam, you were originally an outsider, no wonder it was so powerful when it appeared. The strength. It is inferred that the few gentlemen who are similar to you should also be outsiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, strong curiosity poured into their hearts, Brad The young knight couldn't help but ask: "Mr. Adam, Mr. Lucian, what is the outside world? Are there any poems and stories that are so beautiful? Are there many strong ones who are not worse than witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam refers to the thoughtful side of Lucian: "I have been in a place of imprisonment for decades, I don’t know much about the outside situation, or Lucien talks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several servants in the distance stopped talking to each other, and their eyes focused on Lucien, they are the same to the outside world. Curious, and the life inside the magic tower is extremely boring, it is good to hear the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is only a rough description, it is completely different from the scenery here, so that Karina and others can enjoy it, especially the city of the sky, the magic steam train that can run to the sky, the magical parliament form that is completely unimaginable. The incredible alchemy life is what makes them yearn for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many wonderful places in the world, there is a city of the sky." Carina looked confusedly into the silver moon in midair, it seems It's hard to believe that a city can fly there, and then she is more enthusiastic than her companions: "Mr. Lucian, don't know how powerful the Magic Council is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the layers of magic towers above the terrace, and the tone was flustered: "The magician like the old witch is everywhere in the magic parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Everywhere..." Even Adam was shocked by the description of Lucien. He was impressed by the high-level magician and the knight of this level. Stronger, won't let a middle-level magician meet high-level at any time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I am telling the truth, at least for me." Of course, the premise is that I can get as much as I do. Erm crown ring, get the identity of the element will be high-level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien emphasized: "There are many magicians who are ten times, one hundred times, and one thousand times stronger than her."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Carina felt that this was beyond her imagination. She and Alva and others looked at Lucien’s eyes with awe and trust. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the deliberate flaunting of the magical parliament’s powerful success, let the prisoners in desperate ecstasy see themselves as objects that can be followed, and Lucien nodded with satisfaction and looked at him. To a few servants, "arrogant" authentic: "I am in a place of imprisonment because I sent a letter to a dark mountain for a certain lord. Maybe it will take a long time for someone to save me. In front of the legendary magician, the old witch Like an ant, how do you want to pinch it to death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch is almost a madman, and he is stuck here and can’t get out, not at all. Worried about the problem of the legendary magician, but her servants are still normal people, after hearing the words of Lu Xien "the king of the arrogant wild", they have slightly changed their face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not continue to show off, because it is difficult to get people to believe in empty words, it is better to stop, let servants, Karina and others use their own imagination To make up for the gaps, and do not need them to really believe, as long as they can leave this impression in their hearts, they will interfere with their judgments and decisions at critical moments, anyway, this is a icing on the cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magician? How strong are they?" As a magician, Carina almost instinctively asked this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adams for Lucien replied: "It is easy to destroy this magic tower, destroy nearby cities, villages, and destroy the dark forests around..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has not seen the legendary shot, he answered according to his own imagination, and Karina and others were shocked again, so that the servants looked a little blinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, Karina looked at Lucien with the enthusiasm for the Magic Council and the legendary magician: "Mr. Lucian, how many are you? What is the position of the magician in the magical parliament? How many rings does the old witch have?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed softly: “No need to call me Sir, we are all prisoners, there is no distinction between high and low. I am only one of the many middle-level magicians in the Magic Council. There is still a long way to go from the high level. There is really no place to be proud, and the old witch probably has Seven rings, or eight rings." The strength of the middle level is enough, there is no need to expose specific levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intermediate Magician? You really is a mid-level magician!" Karina surprises, in this area where resources and knowledge are seriously flawed, The magician is very rare and harder to promote than the big knight, so after confirming that Lucien is a mid-level magician, Karena, the girl who is interested in the magical path, is like Alva, Brad, Ophelia. Others saw Adam’s reverence and enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ophelia, Alva and others can't help but step back a few steps, pale face: "The old witch has seven or eight rings?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the two-ring magician of Carina, they are obvious to all, how strong is the seven-eighth magician? Why did she hide in the magic tower and did not rule the nearby territory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
