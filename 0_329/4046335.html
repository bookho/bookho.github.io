			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year hasn't seen, Arthur's body is getting more rounded, so that his large brown long dress has a cracking feeling, wearing a top on his head. The same color of the soft hat, showing a familiar and unconstrained posture with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Holm, regardless of the hot weather or the cold, the gentlemen must go out, or suits, or double-row long dresses, or safari, top There are thick and different differences in the materials, and it is impossible to distinguish the seasons from their dressing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Lucien sneaked through the dark belly, and the jackets of his own magician were all magical robes, which can automatically adjust the temperature and humidity, and it doesn’t matter what they wear. And if the guys who don’t even have the official knight ranks go to the southern Gusta Empire, the Buriana Kingdom, etc., isn’t the summer fainting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome back, Evans." Arthur's face was filled with a warm and welcoming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperation between the two companies is much closer through the cooperation of Minerals and Harvest Company. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien removed the black top hat on his head and prepared to hand it to Leo, smiling: "Arthur, I didn't expect you to be the first I came to visit me, I have not notified other friends, you will know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, without the hat, His Royal Highness invites you to a private party We said as we walked. Hey, over the past few years, several different models of Jinluo have been promoted very smoothly, and the income and profits are very high!" When it comes to this matter, Arthur couldn’t help but lick his palm and show it. Inner excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stopped the action and wondered: "What is the private party of His Royal Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the aristocratic gathering organized by His Royal Highness, and the nobles in it have the most open-minded attitude towards the magician. Especially after seeing the success of Jin Lanjia and the expected follow-up rich income, I want to work with the magicians. Similar cooperation, so His Royal Highness wants to invite Evans to participate in the past, and to meet them, they are very curious about you." Arthur explained a few words. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he seems to think that the relationship between the two is close because of the interest bundle, so Lu Xien as a concentrated study, the magician who does not understand the human relationship details him Analyze the benefits, "Evans, this is an excellent opportunity for you to expand your network. Many of them are big aristocrats. In Renttat, there are many long-running forces in various counties, and they have a lot of resources. Although you are a magician. There is a bright future, but there is no need to waste a lot of time to solve a lot of things. Once a wide network of contacts is established, a letter can solve many problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "And these enlightened aristocrats, in addition to their own strong knight strength, are more or less connected with some high-level magicians, will bring you great help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to the good intentions of His Royal Highness, let's go now." Lucien smiled and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after he came back, he became a disciple of the storm, and there is no need to pass the nobility with the high-level magician, but Prince Patrick is Na Tasha’s awkwardness helped him a lot in the “Minerals and Harvests” business, and even took out his shareholding in the Holm Mining Association as a reward for promoting environmental protection. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing with the great aristocrats is indeed beneficial to their activities in the Kingdom of Holm, and later the popularization of some alchemy products has to rely on them, they can Not so much time and energy on similar things. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, kidnapping the big aristocrats to "win-win" and let the people get used to the "magicization" of the convenient era is to effectively stabilize the foundation of the magic parliament and slowly weaken the church. Lucien, who has the spirit of the "master" of the Magic Council, is very happy with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............呜~The whistle is long, the jingle’s iron wheel collides with the track faster and faster, and the magic steam train is rolling forward, no The impediment is fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if I have been sitting many times, I can’t help but feel the shock when I see the magic steam train. It will be two The distance between cities has been shortened a lot, bringing unbelievably convenient, especially in the vicinity of the mine, the cargo-type magic steam train has reduced our previous transportation costs to an unimaginable degree. Evans, why the Magic Council Do not cooperate with us to build a magic steam train line? After several years, there are less than ten lines!” Arthur? Doyle looked at Lucien, and was very sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resources? Right! From another point of view, the line and the train are indeed resources." Arthur licked his lips. "It is a pity that His Majesty the King personally presided over this matter, or else the Mining Union has hope..." It seems to be a bit of a complaint to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly converges his look and handed out a kraft envelope to Lucien: "Evans, more than a year ago due to initial construction costs, Not promoted and other issues, no annuity, until the last eight months, after the promotion of the kingdom, the income of Kim Min-la has exploded. This is your dividend, huh, you are a magician, so you come from shares The annuity is paid monthly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien took the envelope and opened it to see a bright red book with magic And the double imprint of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"13,000 Jintale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before it’s promoted, On average, more than a thousand Quinta's dividends per month are very lucrative profits. If such support is given in four countries, Lucien expects a monthly income of 10,000 Gentale will no longer be a dream, then When I was in the high-level magician stage, I had no problem with the usual experiment and pharmacy expenses. At most, I wanted to buy good equipment, carry out some high-cost experiments, and use some good medicines to save some time in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the high-level magician is definitely taking out the money, not the rich count, can not afford a high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge is wealth." Lucien sighed sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur is confident and confident: "When it is thoroughly promoted and stabilized, I am confident that Ivans will receive a dividend of five or six thousand Jintales a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he suddenly sighed: "Unfortunately, such a huge profit has made many high-level magicians see, and other three countries have high-level magicians to develop new ones." Alchemy substances, and establish a company in cooperation with the nobility, otherwise the income will double."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is expected in Lucian, money, a lot Money, a lot of money is enough to drive people to break out of powerful forces. Sooner or later, high-level magicians will circumvent their alchemy schemes to synthesize new types of "fertilizers", which is one of the driving forces for human progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Arthur looking at himself with a sigh of relief, Lucien smiled and comforted: "We started earlier than them, this is the biggest advantage." Through the review of the Magic Council, these high-level magician's alchemy program certainly does not allow you to find a place to look for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development can't stop it. It can promote the expansion of the industry and let more farmers get a bumper harvest. It is also a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lentart, the six-pointed star platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coach of the Holm royal family? Buffalo is very excited to walk back and forth on the platform. From time to time, I look at the buildings with smooth and sharp lines around them. They are very different from the architecture of the entire Rentit, with a mysterious and cold taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase of the magic steam train line, the more the platform is built, and the presence of the alchemy workshop in the suburbs, the magic parliament begins to slowly Weaken the fog that envelopes the platform, try to get more people to reach the alchemy products, touch the magic, and eliminate the fear in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the entanglement of interests, the nobility took an attitude of discouragement or disapproval of this matter, and the isolated church had to watch it happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poker is different from most ordinary people who are a little scared of magicians. When he hears the legend of a magician from an early age, he does not envy those heroes and pastors, but thinks Become a magical, powerful, horrible magician. Unfortunately, until middle age, he did not have magical talents, and he could only continue his career as a coachman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ten years of the royal family, he has been exposed to some magicians more or less, but none of them made him so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The harvest of oats in the field made me stunned, golden golden everywhere... this is the first time after paying the lord tax There are so many surpluses... What kind of money is a bit expensive, it is worth it, the children at home don’t have to be hungry anymore! You don’t have to pay for your own salary!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
