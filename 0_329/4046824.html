			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at the information in his hand and said in the sound of slaps: "The combination of different magic patterns is indeed quite different from ours." The difference, but does not rule out that he is deliberately changed after redemption, and the magician who is qualified to obtain the complete structure of the artificial planet will not be stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One There are only one type of construction model of magic or magic array. As long as the corresponding principles and processes are met, the last spell model or magic array can achieve the desired effect. Therefore, different magicians often construct spells based on an arcane principle. Different models with the same core but different details will appear, with different levels of personal thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, when the details of the design are perfect enough and the principle is appropriate, it will have better effects than other similar spell models. This is also unique. One of the sources of magic - but this is not better in nature, because it is subject to the core structure and cannot exceed its limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, most of the magic that can be freely communicated will eventually be unified into the best-performing spell model, which is the so-called "standard spell" of the ancient magical empire. This is especially true in the Magic Council of Open Research. In many cases, improvements to spells must rely on a deeper grasp of the principles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the last hundred years, the Arcaneists of the Magic Council have discovered that there may not be a real "standard spell", that is, The best-performing spell model is not universal, with different best-effect models in different magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange phenomenon caused widespread concern at the time, and further research showed that this is due to the different cognitive worlds of different magicians, so the most Spell models that are suitable for their own cognitive world work best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, many magicians exchanged the standard method after surgery, in addition to the analysis, the details will be adjusted. In order to be more adaptable to oneself, of course, the cognitive world will be stable after the middle stage, and there is no need for magic apprentices and formal mages to do so. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. It’s fine to narrow the scope. I don’t believe that he will do nothing in the future. Just a few more similar things will almost certainly determine who it is. "Fernando draws a circle on the list." I hate this guy and can't wait to get him out immediately, let him realize what it means to be a real storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing this matter, Douglas suddenly asked Fernando, Brooke and Lucien to make progress in quantum field theory: "The problem of infinity has not been solved yet." Program? I think the idea of ​​your field theory is very correct. Going down this road will sooner or later fully understand the nature of electromagnetic force. At least now this explanation is much better than the past. Maybe wait until this theory is formed. Brooke's broken and solidified world of understanding can be completely restored, and there is a chance to find his own path of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his tone and words can be seen He is still very concerned about Brooke, a "rebellious student". However, finding a road does not mean promotion. It does not mention the success rate of promotion. It may take many years to perfect the details on this road. For example, Douglas has seen the road of the gods from the general theory of relativity for several years, but his path is still not "find". At least it is necessary to find out the existence of the planet or black hole with the help of the "real world" feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Infinity..." Fernando repeated it in a low voice, as if he wanted to eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and replied: "We decided to submit this series of papers over time, so that more orthopaedic artists can study together, maybe their ideas can Give us the inspiration to solve this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the study of arcane is no more than magic, the foundation is solid, the talent is sufficient, the middle and high level arcane masters also Can make a huge contribution, especially in the last ten years, many achievements in this new field of the micro world are made by young arcane masters whose arcane rank is not high. This is a young age, and Lu Xien is the most outstanding. Representative..." Douglas said with some emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "There is also a large part of the chairperson and the teacher, you are finished, the speaker, how are you prepared for the planet? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s better than expected. After about a month or two, I will be able to jump in the ultra-long-range space, hoping to find that it hurts me. A few hundred years of little guys." Douglas had a rare humor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and said: "I changed my plan, first to suspend the search for a planet far away, because the sun closer to us may be more convenient to find, although it has not been successful before."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient magical empire, the legendary magicians used the space to jump to find the sun, but did not harvest, so that the sun is like a silver moon, is a "symbol" of a certain kind of god, without consent It is impossible to find in the case, and from the comparison between the sun and the silver moon, perhaps the "sun god" is not a god, but a true god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, before the Douglas celestial system was launched, the sun shines in the daytime, the sun that brings light and heat is universally worshipped, and the magicians give meaning. Together with Silver Moon, it has become a special star in the star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of this idea, no legendary magician went to find the sun until Douglas became a legend, but he also did not find the sun, so he initially agreed. In the later exploration of the universe, the target was aimed at the stars farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Speaker, you must be careful, the way we calculate or consider the factors is not necessarily complete, if it is directly on the surface of the sun after transmission, it is very dangerous. Lucien reminded with concern that this is the "fussing father of the magic world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the possibility of direct transmission to the interior of the sun, Lucien does not have I have thought that regardless of the high temperature of terror or the huge gravity, it will prevent the "opening" of "the door of time and space", a good-looking novel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a good thing, even if I die on the spot, I have no regrets." Douglas said with a smile, it seems that this is really a good thing. Fernando next to <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn’t say much, it’s not so easy for the legendary magician to die completely. His red eyes looked at Lucien: "What are you busy with in the field for the past six months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolving legendary spells to enhance magical power Strive to reach the top of the third-order as soon as possible, and lay the foundation for the fourth-order impact." Lu Xien did not seem to understand the meaning of the teacher's words, "truly" answered, but this is indeed the focus of his time. After the "forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow" and "the element of blessing", there are thirteen legendary magics in his soul, which can reach fifteen in a year, with the basis of the legendary peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando didn’t say so well: “I know that you are progressing fast. I am asking about your application to the Magic Research Council. What are you going to build in the Atomic Research Institute? It takes so much valuable material, which is equivalent to a nine-level magic item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he came, he heard a sentence and did not know the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have invested more in supporting materials than I applied." Lucien shook his head with a smile. "There are at least a lot of high-quality areas." The magician dare to enter, and some places even have to be **, so it is impossible to let more ordinary magicians with arcane talents explore and study those areas. This is a big impact on the development of arcane. After all, many achievements nowadays. Depending on the particle collision, relying on a few strange trajectories found in countless experiments, depending on the screening of a large amount of data, it will take dozens of times, even hundreds of times, by the legendary magician and sorcerer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers: "Very good ideas, are there specific results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Close to success, I will be open to all Arcans, but must apply in advance and undergo a rigorous review." Lucien described his "alchemy items" roughly, and was endorsed by Douglas and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and others curiously looked at the door of a small laboratory, which was quiet and silent, and there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the teacher has been locked up in this small lab in recent months? Is there any magical fluctuations from time to time?" Rina doesn't think that the Institute of Atomic Research and Heidi are so sparse. Instead, there is a feeling of familiarity and warmth that finally comes home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi chicks whispered their heads frequently: "Well, I don't know what the teacher is studying, so mysterious, but every time he will experiment The room seal is very tight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
