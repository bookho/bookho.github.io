			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Starlight Shield" spell model was thoroughly analyzed by Lucien, and also tried to simulate the construction many times, line data, spatial positional relationship, etc. I am familiar with it, and I have no doubt about my own calculation and construction. Therefore, it is calm and without emotion fluctuations, let the soul itself condense a transparent and close to the illusory lines, let them slowly construct into a complex but full It is a three-dimensional model of a straight line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the roots of the "soul line" appear exactly and connect together, Lucien feels that they are not showing signs of failure such as chaos or collapse. I found that my mental energy consumption is very huge. Only one-third of the models are constructed, and only half of the mental power is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mental power must be used accurately." Lucian didn't panic, didn't worry, looked at his soul as if he was observing the experiment, trying Control the spirit, let it not waste a little in the process of guiding the soul to condense the lines. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is still distracting from the "ground fire feng shui" element and slowly recovering some of the spiritual power without causing the soul line to shake and make mistakes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of enough knowledge and a thorough understanding of the spell model. Otherwise, it is impossible to distract when you concentrate on calculation and construction. And most of the magic apprentices in the construction of the spell model, because they are not fully resolved and thoroughly mastered, can only slowly try, relying on the failure feedback again and again to mediate the line until the final spell model is completed, so the mental power consumption will naturally It is several times and ten times more than Lucien. Therefore, they often dare to try to break through when they are close to the formal magician. Some even rely on the “Magic Gate” pharmacy that can supplement the mental power and the correct spell model in this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the onlookers of Lucien become increasingly unstable, and the mental power is close to cognac, but the "Starlight Shield" spell model has Approaching perfection, like a transparent, small pyramid made up of many straight lines. In the process, Lucien's structure did not appear to have a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has an illusion that his body is shaking and his hands are shaking, but he still resists discomfort and squeezes out the last bit of mental power, like to the patient. Surgery and stability make the last line of soul condense smoothly with the vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this "soul line" is connected with the "small pyramid", the whole model is completely perfected, slamming inward and condensing, madly absorbing the surrounding Star power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the stars surged into the vortex of the collapse of the model, and even the soul of Lucien was completely smothered, letting Lucien feel From the depths of the soul, the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectator consciousness has been very vague, but Lucien’s persistence of never giving up is still supporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the soft and clear stars of the glory bloomed from the soul, smoothing all kinds of severe pains and hallucinations, and Lussien’s spectator consciousness stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stars dissipated, Lucien saw a transparent illusionary crystal of the size of a fingernail in his soul around the "destination of the main star of fate", which is the small pyramid. A "Starlight Shield" spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul itself is still illusory and can’t be touched, but it seems to be more dense and stable, even with the illusion of faint starlight, some kind of road Clear qualitative change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open your eyes, Lucien feels that the soul and spirit are unprecedentedly powerful, and as long as they are willing, they will immediately receive a "Starlight Shield", so they smile Speak to himself: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Lucian, the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Smile with a pure joy from the heart, because Lucien thinks that this is based on his own ability and hard work, is something completely his own, more than a concert success, symphony music received a crazy response, and is known as a The beginning of the era is more happy and satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"It took only ten minutes? Oh, one more minute, my mental power can't be supported, and knowledge is really the magic. ..." Lucien saw from the "hourglass hourglass" on another table that there was only three minutes left to disintegrate, and then canceled the plan to build a spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Remember, keep moving forward, don't look back." From Muskilllin's message, it seems dangerous to leave through the small gate of the Magic Garden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lucien stood up and pulled the door and found it to be motionless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, according to the unsealing method left by Maskillin, Lucien spent a minute on the spirit and intensity of the official magician to easily unravel. The first layer of the seal of "曰之冕" is able to use the "Sacred Light Strike" and "Resist Undead" two magical techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, in the last time of the silent number, Lucien dragged the residual image into the room on both sides, and the casting materials could not be wasted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Materials that are too dangerous can't be taken! Who knows what happens when you wait, if the magical utensils that store the material are broken, let them leak out, I can It was the most stupid way to be selected for the 'Darwin Evolution Award'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not take materials that you don't know, just see if they are dangerous, can I use them? It’s a lot of time wasted, but now it’s less than two minutes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Lu Xien calmly ruled out all kinds of greedy but inappropriate ideas, one In half the time, I took a tube of "Vampire's Blood", two tubes of "Ether", two "Fairy Hair", three tubes of "Snia Burning Powder" and a box of "Magic Oil". Some of them are casting materials, and some are the key to refining magical remedies. For example, the "Song of Water" therapeutic agent requires "the blood of the vampire" and "the ether." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time is only fifteen seconds, Lucienk controls the greed, returns to the hall, stands in front of the door to the magic garden, and concentrates on waiting The enchanted lock began to disintegrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"10 seconds, nine seconds...three seconds, two seconds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room The hall suddenly began to vibrate slightly, and the black door jumped back and forth, revealing a long, invisible gray-white corridor with magical plants on either side of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white flame in the fireplace, surrounded by soft black and white gray, suddenly there are countless cracks in the horizontal and vertical, silent and like a glass broken like a piece of peeling, It reveals the eternal silence behind and the tedious black and white contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the black small door retreat, did not care about how it was activated, and did not surprise the broken parts of the surrounding scenery, turning into a faint The white afterimage was directly thrown into the grayish white corridor that had not yet broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow~Wow~Wow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of baby crying sounds behind Lucien It can be drowned in silence in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not look back, the speed brought by "Moonlight Blood" to the maximum, and the magic plants on both sides suddenly moved, a high The tall ordinary tree hurriedly pulled up his roots and ran wildly on the left side of Lucien. The branches he waved slipped from Lucien's face several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other grotesque magical plants floating in the air, frogs jumping forward, throwing their heads to the front, then head The ministry has grown up with a new one. In short, when Sean runs forward in the seemingly endless gray corridor, the guys on both sides are so weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is the fastest, except for the magic plants in front of him, and more and more are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜呜呜" cries, "hahaha" laughs, "嘤嘤嘤" snoring sounds from time to time, but disappears immediately, as if behind There is a monster with a huge mouth that swallows them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic plants on both sides are getting more and more crazy, dozens of black snake-like branches are stalking toward Lucien, a thing that only dry palms suddenly From the foot of Lucien, Wayne did not go to curiosity about what happened behind him. He only concentrated on his own progress. At this time, he strode forward and just avoided the branches and palms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Ah! Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming screaming voice keeps on the road Sean’s ear rang, and there were countless pale sorrows in front of them. They floated in the air and waved their arms, intercepting Lucien from all sorts of incredible angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
