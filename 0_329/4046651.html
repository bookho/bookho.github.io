			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After completing the paper on "Quantum Mechanics", Lucien did not submit it immediately, but he carefully studied various applications and analyzed the soul. The new legendary magic formed inside - the real world feedback, the soul and the cognitive world are relatively stable, and the fourth legendary spell model can be built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month of analysis, Lucien roughly grasped the strange and unpredictable magic of this legendary magic, it is the magic of the auxiliary class, which can make some special features of the micro world. The surname is reflected in the macro world. For example, no matter whether the enemy's defense is strong, magical, or secret, there will be certain uncertainties. There will be a certain probability that the auxiliary attack will be blessed and the magic will be weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, at that moment, in the current world, determinism will collapse, even if you have prepared more life-saving magic, even if you made a talisman Hey, life safety has already been decided locally because of these preparations. After being influenced by this magic, there is a certain probability that it will be completely degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, for Lucien, the stronger the opponent’s strength, the lower the probability, and about 20% of the same level may destroy the determinism. However, the horror of the Douglas Speaker who faced the legendary peak was less than one percent. As for the existence of Yinyue Etna, it is estimated to be more than one in ten thousand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder to give me such a strange feeling, this legendary magic is really a big killer." After Lucine's analysis was completed, Capricorn sighed and sighed, "But the principle What is it, why can some of the micro-world's special surnames be reflected in the macro-world? Exclude interference? Why can we exclude interference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden covenant, Lucy What seems to have been grasped is that it is closely related to the soul and the essence of magic, and it is just the opposite of the ability of the left hand to eliminate magic and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of inspiration is fleeting, Lucien shakes his head and thinks about Natasha’s name for this legendary magic, decided to use "Ivan "The uncertain hand", although the name is long, but it doesn't matter much. This magic is not a direct type of spell casting, but it can be superimposed according to its own intention when applying other magic, without additional preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in this way, the casting time of the legendary magic will increase by one second, and the spell consumption will increase into a geometric progression. Originally, Lucien did not rely on pharmacy. In the case of a battle, you can cast thirty or forty legendary magic in a battle, but if these legendary magics add the effect of "the hand of uncertainty," then seven or eight times will be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the parsing of this magic, Lucien decided to spend a lot of energy on its construction for the next month and then pick up the papers. Go to the Allinge Magic Tower and prepare to submit the paper to the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than a month, members of the Supreme Jury have been studying the electronic fluctuating surnames and corresponding wave functions due to mathematical limitations and spins. The concept has not been proposed, the progress is not big, relatively calm, but Douglas, Hathaway, Brooke and other mathematical field powers have gradually got ideas, and began to improve some mathematical tools, while other arcans are outside their own research, absolutely Most of them have invested in the magic array design of electron diffraction and interference experiments, but unfortunately there is no progress. During the period, Hathaway, Helen, and Klaus all visited Lucien, and they were equally curious about the crystal research, and Lucien euphemistically He said that he was trapped in the vacancies of mathematical tools and pre-knowledge when he tried to deepen his research in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Lucien, Hathaway and Helen did not say anything, but they can see that they have the intention to study mathematical knowledge in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, they will be remembered again by the magical history due to their great contributions in the field of mathematics. Perhaps they can build a complete system of "magic crystallography", Lucy En is very optimistic about this, because their mathematical talents are actually better than themselves, especially Hathaway, which is undoubtedly the top three in all the mathematical "powers" of the entire parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during this time, Lucien and Natasha’s life is still the same, the pressure from the church powerhouse and Ketonia seems to be slowly over time Forgotten, this makes Lucien's nephew a very comfortable, in addition to the arcane and magic research, there is music, love, warm and bleak, there are two kinds of fun things brought by the surname, there are The devastating fun of students such as Annick and Heidi, as well as the magical school, the Buffalo School, and the general school preparations, Lucy deliberately added the bad taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not jump directly to his office, Lucien wore a black top hat, hands in his dress pocket, strolling to the Allinge Magic Tower, not for anything else, just to see the red banner hanging outside the magic tower At the same time, I think about the things that I need to be busy in March: "In addition to building the 'unsure hand', I have to start refining the exclusive legendary items. Over the past six months, I have refining a lot of items. Grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is the authority in the field of alchemy, Lucien has always been a theoretical school. The actual number of refining magic items is quite small. The articles are much stronger, and the exclusive legendary items can't be faked by others. Therefore, Lucien put most of the arcane points obtained by the new alchemy and general relativity into the purchase of materials, and improved the proficiency through repeated alchemy experiments. confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although more than half a year later, Lucien practiced one item after another, wasting one piece after another, even if the refining items were all converted into Going out, the arcane point is also passing fast, and there is not much left, but he almost has the grasp of refining the legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proficiency really depends on burning money to improve..." Lucien remembered the game he had played before, and snorted, and he already In front of the Allinge Magic Tower, I saw a red banner with a bandit on the door, which is at the extreme of the style of the dreamy tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High School of Magic Unified School Entrance Examination designated examination room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One sees this thing, the road Sean couldn't help but smile, too familiar and too kind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the banner, surrounded by a lot of magicians, they are excitedly looking at the introduction board at the door:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holt Institute of Magic, a strong faculty, a combination of middle and high level arcane divisions, and a number of members of the Arcane Review Committee." Although the introduction is a little weird, it does not prevent them from understanding the Meaning, excited to communicate with people around. "Is this a college for low-level arcans? It's so good, there is no teacher. It's too painful to learn by myself. Most of the papers in the journals don't understand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the past is fine. The current arcane theory has changed a lot in almost a year. I can't keep up with it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The registration time is due at the end of March. The examination time is from April to June.... Is this unified entrance exam through this higher magic school?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very good! Not afraid of those who have a background, the relationship of the magician seized the quota, all by their own Force, take a quick look at what is being tested?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Right right! This is the fairest way!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to their delightful praise, Lucien’s mouth twitched, I hope that you can maintain this view, don’t curse me in the future, curse the high school of magic to take the entrance exam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanist who crossed the door without notice, Lucy En came to the study of teacher Fernando and found that he was finishing the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, have you finished the study?" Lucien asked with a smile. Fernando looked at him: "Yes, the principle of incompatibility, but what the fourth quantum number represents is still unclear, and your research has yielded results." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien silently took out "On Quantum Mechanics" and handed it to Fernando: "Mathematically solved, but the specific meaning of the Arcane remains to be determined. Exploring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took the paper and cautiously asked: "Is there a subversion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No, from the perspective of particle surnames and discontinuous surnames." Lucien said in the heart, although the most subversive things are hidden inside, no one will notice until its meaning is clarified. I have long since removed the part of the uncertainty principle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Particle name, non-contiguous surname?" Fernando laughed. "You verified the electronic fluctuating surname, letting Brooke, Oliver, Hathaway, etc. In the direction of the wave, I turned around and solved the problem from the perspective of particles. It’s really interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
