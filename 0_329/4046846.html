			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the "Blue Gate", "The Lord of Hell" Maldi Moss holds the gold trident in his right hand and the left hand into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory ripples of a circle surround the black arm of this sulphur flame, and the more it moves closer to the palm of your hand, the more sturdy it is. lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front end of the palm is completely blurred, and it seems that the core of this embarrassment leads to another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mardi Moss’s golden trident in the right hand holds the soft light, causing the “blue door” to have a slight uncontrollable shake, spilling the empty blue, Trying to wrap the entire void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elves" Aglecia stepped back, the ghost tree behind it suddenly solidified, and the fuzzy roots grew one after another brown-green The strange limbs, they are grouped in groups of three, entangled with each other, knotted like a monster, deeply "snapped" into the light of the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the radiant glow of the water becomes soothing, like the sea where the hurricane has subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space near Agleia is like a torrent of water, but the "soil" firmly grasped by the roots is not lost, but still solidified In place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she calmly withdrew from the scope of the "Blue Gate" and was not blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she played a semi-fusion effect with the Elf tree, and her face was quite pale at this time, obviously it was not a small price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After withdrawing from the "Azure Gate" range, Agleia raised the "natural punishment" longbow to align this legendary fourth-order item The "Lord of Hell". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cangjie escape is the easiest to be attacked by the back of the person, so she intends to attack and keep Mardi Moss’ attention to the defense first, so that she Can be safely separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of green light shines on the fingertips of Agraia, and the “heart of nature” behind it shines, creating a piece of nature that encompasses the entire cycle. Beautiful, and the golden trident in the right hand of Maldives is also aimed at her, seems to be ready to use the five most powerful spell abilities of the body<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Mardi Moss’s left hand in the void suddenly swelled like a small sun bursting directly in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory ripples are broken, the left hand is directly annihilated, and the energy storm that sweeps everything is not stopped, and continues to flock to Mardi Moss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of Maldives’s violent spurt is like entering another time and space, but also seems to permeate the whole world, living in every wisdom with negative emotions. In my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing, changeable, ubiquitous, invisible, and so on, the most essential atmosphere of the gods and the "blue door" and "elf tree" The glory of the gods is very similar, but they are a little more important than the "soul fireplace". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy storm drowned Mardi Moss, but inside it sounded the evil to the extreme "sound", like a sacred saying:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sin regeneration!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Mardi Moss is in the energy storm, his "natural punishment long arrow" cannot Directly shot, Agleia put down the longbow, the body is blurred and then twisted, disappearing in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not escape at this time, when will you wait? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterimage of the "Sorcer Tree" fades slowly in the deep black water, and the "energy storm" finally subsides, and the illusory figure is solid again. The right hand is still holding the golden trident, the left hand is still intact, covered with black scales, burning with a blazing flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this magic?" Mardi Moss, who seemed to be unharmed, looked at the void in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lord of Hell" stood quietly in front of the "Blue Gate", neither chasing the "Emperor Queen" Agleia, nor continuing to explore the "atomic universe" of the vanity invasion of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body changes, restoring the fisherman's appearance of Helks, covered with sapphire scales and wearing a blue crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the crimson eyes turned red, and the indifference changed to sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be looking at the deep black sea that is gently fluctuating above, and the same ridiculous smile hangs in the corner of the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow of the setting sun on the sea surface has sprinkled, and the golden waves of the layers are beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the reefs, the "Mermaid Princess" Doris's golden fish tail slaps the water and provokes a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt that the bottom of the tens of thousands of meters rushed out of an extremely evil atmosphere, and then saw a strip of normal fish scales under the water became dark The eyes became reddish and smelled of sulfur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mutation did not surprise her, but said to herself: "Why not stop the coming of the material world? This is not good for anyone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, her expression was distorted, and the voice became old and hoarse: "'Silver Moon, I am happy to see that I can come to the main material world steadily, Sharing the pressure to deal with me, in fact, Mardi Moss’s plan will never forget the real opponent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I will never think of it, my time How great is the harvest, and when I succeed, even if they join hands, they are just clowns in the circus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of this voice is the Pope "Three generations", "Disaster King" Viken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mermaid princess" Doris's voice is once again wonderful - touching: "Is it silvermoon, is it nearby?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very likely that my destiny master has a hunch, anyway, Lucien = Evans already knows the position of the 'Blue Gate, there is an opportunity to explore in the future, Maldives can not always keep Here. I don't know the eccentricity of the world, I am always not practical." The hoarse voice of the old man came out of her mouth, it seems that she is willing to let Viken project into her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cruel but absolutely outstanding magician, the pursuit of the essence of the world is still flowing in the "blood" of Viken, convinced that the individual and the world are divided Not open, especially the world-class existence of the god-like world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be seen from the fact that the gods must rely on things like hell, abyss, silver moon or paradise mountain to be truly degraded, so don’t touch the world The mystery of rushing to improve yourself is really a risky thing. Just like Tanos and his own transition state, he ate a lot of losses and buried serious hidden dangers. If there were no other roads to choose at that time. I certainly will not do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world is currently the most weird is also the point that makes all the legendary strong people feel that it must contain a huge secret, that is, the planet can not be found, it is only the depth of the ocean. The fact that I am going back and forth, so even if I am the number one enemy of Lucien and the Magic Council, I am very happy to see them explore and study this issue. On this, I don't mind standing on the side of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doris’s soft voice sounded: “Silver Moon may be waiting for you to shoot...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the distant waves of the undulating "Wan Dao Jin Guang", the sound is erratic, like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other direction of the sea, a handsome man in a red jacket and a black turtleneck coat walked slowly on the sea. But he brightened his shoes and There is always a thin layer of blank space between the blue waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed slightly, and the silver eyes looked at the reflection of the sea and looked at the afterglow of the setting sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterglow undulating with the waves. It seems that his reflection is covered with a golden cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky City, Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Agrea has returned to the Elf King Court, 'Lord of the Hell, no pursuit." In Hathaway's study, let go of his own research work. Douglas first announced the results of his contact with the Elf Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen has been guarding Alin Erman for five years, so the current city of the sky is the "element dominator" Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will be relieved." Although "Emperor Queen" Aglesia has her own ambitions and is not completely standing with the parliament, but facing The "Lord of Hell" came down, and one of the legendary ally's allies was definitely stronger than one. Therefore, Lucien was relieved with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's method of manipulating the magical array in an orderly manner, simply said: "All legendary magicians have been notified · Be careful 'the Lord of Hell, raid."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides several legendary peaks, even the Arcanist has to be cautious about this matter. If it is not prepared by the "Hell Lord" raid, it is likely to fall directly. So after Lucien and Natasha submitted the information to Hathaway, the first decision she made was to inform the legendary magician who had not gone out, and to initiate the emergency contact left by the legendary magicians. Device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the emergency contact device still does not reach the magicians in special places such as different spaces, they return to the main material world or leave the dark mountains, ruins, etc. After that, I will immediately know that the main material world has "more" a message of a hostile god, and then come back carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that this situation would have been stable, and I couldn’t think of such a big change." Oliver, who just returned, smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul of the dead" Vicente looked at the half-opening of the outside lock, coldly said: "It is not necessarily a bad thing, Mardi Moss has always benefited Mainly, the biggest enemy is the Wicken and the Southern Church. Maybe we still have the opportunity to cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is devoted to studying neutrons and fission The details of the problem, so half closed the "Thunder Hell", and have not received the news yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the devil has no limits, and if the interests are sufficient, he will not hesitate to sell us and cooperate with Viking, so it is best to expel the master. The material world.” Lucien’s tone was firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With us? Unless all the legendary magicians join forces, there is only one percent hope, but other enemies?" "Transformation Master" Erica The sound came from the surrounding half-plane projection, and she was guarding the Calais branch to prevent the "Hell Lord" raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently nodded: "I can't do it by light, I am going to the 'night plateau, visit the Earl of Silvereye, and seek the god of silver moon." , help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s relationship with Rhein and Etna, the highest commenting group is well known, so no one thinks the proposal has a problem, but Douglas Shaking his head and sighing a sigh: "The possibility is not big, for <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Silver Moon, for the Maldives, the main material plane is Very good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was in a state of emergency in which the "Lord of Hell" suddenly came, and did not have time to think about the overall situation. After hearing the words of the Speaker, I sneak a little and then understand, this is indeed true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the possibility is not great, but still have to try." Never give up and retreat is the motto of Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas slightly dagger: "Let Fernando do this thing, you are seriously injured, 'The Arcane sorcerer, and the Truth Shield, must hurry Repair, otherwise it will be difficult to fix, it is not suitable for going out at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I wrote a letter to let the teacher take it." Lucien thought of the teacher. The relationship with the "King of Nightmare" and the relationship between the "King of Nightmare" and the Dark Council did not persist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the "Atomic Universe," Lucien sighed softly, and there was no eternal ally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
