			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little stars are covered by the bright and dazzling light, and there seems to be a new sun in the night sky, which exudes its own ambiguity, no Intentionally run in the sky along a given trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooking what he felt out of his "electromagnetic kingdom", standing in a study on the 34th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, some lost Looking up at the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the birth of a true star..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too close, If it is really a star, it will collide with the world and let everything annihilate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is such an unimaginable shocking power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great arcian, it is again With the legendary magician who grew up in the force field, the astrology, and the dark Douglas, Brooke just calculated the brightness, size, and other data to calculate the approximate orbital range. Although it is not precise enough, it is enough to judge its distance from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, he will be slightly lost. If it is really the birth of the stars, he is not so surprised and confused. The idea that was generated in the first time must be to prepare the corresponding magic to carefully observe and study the scene of the birth of the stars and explore the mysteries of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Buriana, a magic tower that goes straight into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-ranking astrologer was originally prophesying something based on the fate of the crystal movement into the crystal ball, but at this time it was slightly open-mouthed. The expression looked at the starry sky with a sluggish look. He had never seen such a bright, so exaggerated star, and it was such a sudden and unexpected appearance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even more incredible than the blushing month of the previous period! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this star?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he muttered In the language, then, he suddenly woke up, looked down at the crystal ball in his hand, and looked at the fate of the fate that had changed since he was not paying attention. Some annoyed and frustrated: "You have to start again, a star. The birth will surely bring about a great change in the fate of the Star River..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, he jerked his head and looked at the air:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is there no reflection of fate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this a star?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the Dark Mountains, the Adventurer’s Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the crowd, observe the changes in the human heart, collect the dreams of the king of nightmare Stanis, enjoy a leisurely afternoon tea in the cabin, suddenly, in his hands The white glazed porcelain cup was out of control, and a beautiful trajectory fell to the ground, giving a crisp and broken sound, turning into countless tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Staniss did not care about this, a flash arrived at the window, looked up and looked at the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing the distant sky, a bright and dazzling star suddenly emerges from nothingness, illuminating half of the sky, with the same brilliance, exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a problem in my cognitive world, influenced by my own dreams or illusions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Staniss looked at the sun in the west, and was not afraid of the glare of looking back at the brand new star, watching it run naturally along the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a dream, such a newly born star, such a horrible star that can compete with the sun, and what kind of psychological mapping does it represent?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of miracle is by no means a 'mortal' can be done..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rentat, on the street without arc street lights, dark and cold, only a little star light to brighten the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increase in alchemy workshops, the textile machinery has been improved by alchemists, and the ordinary citizens of Rentat are increasingly working overtime. The scattered night returners rushed forward in the stars, and the cold winds of the callers made them tired for a day and they just wanted to return to their warm homes as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, they inexplicably found that the road ahead was bright and there was no darkness, as it was during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of it, they subconsciously look up to the sky, suddenly surprised to say no words, when the sky has a round more dazzling with the silver moon Stars, it is standing proudly in the sky, and the enthusiasm is slowly turning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a miracle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great God of Truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the Truth forever..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long-awaited surprise, these ordinary citizens thought that the god of truth was showing miracles, and they were excited and piously praying, completely ignoring the melting snow. Muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto, Natasha in a safari is riding a horse In the sparse woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly bowed and crossed the arrow, a long arrow wrapped around an unreal crack, flashing in front of a big tree a few hundred meters away Then, it cut the butter into several dozen large trees in a row, shot a gray-white rabbit that had just pulled out the bushes, shot it through a layer of fur, and nailed it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of big trees seem to have become sketches, and they are rubbed in the middle with an eraser, and the rest are unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not pay attention to her own proud arrow, but turned slightly and turned to look east, saw the dazzling star as if from the imprisonment Jumped out like a birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of celestial scene makes her subconsciously think of the blushing month of the previous period, and she knows the reason for the blush of the moon, whispering to herself: "Is it made out of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint-Lance Pope Benedict II took the scepter and stood at the window, watching the new star carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hidden..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The track is wrong..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just judge from position, is it the action of the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short time, Pope Benedict II The calm has been restored, and the trajectory of this newly born star is observed indifferently. When he feels that he has understood and remembered the data of this star, he lifted his scepter, his body leaned back slightly, his eyes were half closed, and he looked at it. The starry sky whispers to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great god of truth, you are one, and also 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s an instant, and it’s eternal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s the creator and the master.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With his prayers, the whole person blew a layer of milky white light, flowing with solemn holiness and invisible meaning, a sacred, detached, detached, condescending force slowly emerged from the inexplicable Emerge The shadow of the holy city of Reims and the surrounding area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling this power, the priests such as the cardinal, the sacred knight, the cardinal, and the general communicators of the holy city of Lance have been shocked by the stars. Break free, expressions are gentle and peaceful, with unspeakable touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are one and ten thousand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s an instant, and it’s eternal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of thousands of people followed the prayers, under the influence of the inexplicable forces, they were neat and uniform, creating an exaggerated and horrible resonance, ethereal, It is spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prayers came together, the Pope only gave the scepter in his hand, and suddenly changed in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the center of the sky, a little white light is inexplicably lit, and it grows bigger and becomes a light group that can compete with the sun and artificial planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a glimpse of the melodious and cleansing of the soul in the light group, making the surrounding sky holy and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the eyes of Lucien and others, the dark starry sky is completely illuminated by this light group, and the ear is faintly audible and sorrowful. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien expects that the church will inevitably shoot down the artificial planet of Douglas, otherwise the magician can create the planet, the god of truth that created the world in the propaganda What kind of? Just a magician who is a little more powerful than the Arcanist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corusian did not expect that the church’s reaction would be so intense, and such a scene is too exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light group is more and more clear, and it seems to be divided into seven layers. The first layer is a pair of beautiful angels with wings and countless white souls playing the piano and harp. In the clarinet, the horn, in the sacred praise of the true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second layer up to the fifth floor is a similar joy scene, without a trace of distress and sorrow. The types of angels have changed, and the wings have gradually increased, and there have been power angels, power angels, and intelligent angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth layer is a six-winged blazing angel with six lights and shadows, each occupying one side and presenting a seventh layer of posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seventh layer, in addition to the endless, unseen light, only a glamorous angel holding a book is under the light, like Serve at the feet of the God of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see such a scene, Lucien can't recognize what it is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the true magic of the last incumbent of the Magic Empire in the Twilight War! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real magic of every time you spend a great deal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only real magic that the Pope can master and display, God Drop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While watching the gods drop in the eye, Lucien started a constant electromagnetic communication on a single eye, and seized the time to confirm the "artificial planet" signal. Feedback ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the angels in the light group illuminate the holy light, they gather together, and rapidly expand with the infinite light of the seventh layer, the whole sea will The sky is drowning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is feedback from Antiller One, ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sky that turned into a milky white ocean, listening to the interrupted artificial planet answered, Lucien subconsciously compared this power with the power of the former Silver Moon god Aitna, and got the same level of power, Aitna slightly A weak conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is the vague judgment of Lucien, a high-ranking magician, which may be far from the real situation, even if Douglas and Prince Dracula The existence of a legendary peak cannot accurately determine the level of Atena's level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artificial planet was named Antwerp No.1 because Antwerp was the capital of the ancient Hillanas magical empire, Douglas The place of birth and growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squat door painted with countless constellations suddenly appeared in front of Fernando, Lucien and others, and Douglas, wearing a gray magic robe, walked slightly from it. Out of it, the numerous gems of countless colors that surround the head have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
