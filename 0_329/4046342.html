			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council Headquarters, in a study room on the 33rd floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds a letter with the signature "Oliver? Constantine": "...from the fifth ring, every magical strength is improved It is a process in which the cognitive world begins to interact with the soul and slowly becomes substantive. To become a legendary magician, the cognitive world must be semi-cured to form an area between virtual and real..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading here, Lucien looked up at his teacher with amazement, but Fernando was still a closed-eyed expression, not at all because of the mystery of legends revealed in Oliver’s letter. Shocked, did not swear that I heard the secret that should not be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien’s book The Astrology and Elements contains a ritual of promotion, but because it has not yet reached a high level, there is not enough soul strength and The content of this part of mental reading is not qualified to use the "High Arcane and Magic Library" to check the records in this respect, so I don't know what kind of changes will occur in the body, soul, and spiritual world. And now the Arcanist "the hand of annihilation" Oliver is so simple and simple to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, his real communication target is a big arcian, these are not secrets at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to read. Do you have no ambition and confidence to become a legend?" Fernando did not open his eyes, said plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of having a great arcane teacher as a teacher. You can get a lot of secret knowledge and lay a solid foundation for future development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Sien thought while continuing to read: "Fernando, you also understand that the closer the cognitive world is to the real world, the easier it is to cure. Can reduce the overall difficulty of promotion legend. Considering Florenta's expertise and talent for arcane, this may be one of her main obstacles in the future, so I have been conducting research on cognitive world semi-curing." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the deepening of the research, I found that after ignoring the different cognitive world components based on different arcane theories, the meditation environment, the spatial structure and the real world There are obvious contradictions... Maybe our mathematical basis for spatial description is wrong... We need to look at our mathematical parts from scratch. In this regard, I have some opinions..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s mathematical ability seems to be worse than the level of arcane in his other fields, and there is no commendable view for the time being. Fernando refuted the recklessness and then resorted to this Letter test school Guidance from the mathematical knowledge of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not stupid in mathematical analysis." Fernan said with a blank expression, then smiled and said, "Oliver is very romantic, there are Many lovers, even their female students have gotten their hands, but they are true love for Florenza, just like in the opera."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Teacher, don’t talk so rude or not, Lucien can’t help but groan. There is always a feeling of two people in Fernando. When discussing arcane and magic, he is serious and harsh, eager and eager, like a group of attacks at any time. The roaring storm that comes, makes people tremble, can be transferred to other aspects, it becomes old and unfair, humorous and wretched, and does not mind the casual attitude of students, no wonder there are old metamorphosis nicknames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien without an interface, Fernando shook his head and smiled: "But this way, Florenza’s grievances will get heavier and heavier, they There will be a contradiction between the other day, maybe when Florenza will find a little lover to retaliate. Hey, Oliver’s face must be very beautiful, the hand of annihilation, the hand of annihilation, I don’t know if it will Directly destroying Florencia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a gossip little old man, Lucien wiped the cold sweat that does not exist on his forehead, especially to Oliver. When he will kill Florenza without any responsibility, Fernando will have an obvious love and emotion, and it is an old metamorphosis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, this shouldn't be possible, who dares to touch the wife of a great Arcanist." Lucien tried to get Fernando to end his operatic speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked down on Lucien: "This is not necessarily the case, there will always be crazy young people who are not afraid of death! When I was young, I was better than Oliver. There is more madness, oh, now it’s getting old, without that mind, nothing compares to the mystery of exploring the world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finally returning to the right track, Lucien quickly entered a state of concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading a sealed letter, Fernando continued to take Lucien as an experiment of thermal radiation, collecting more data, and then searching for rules and derivations. Formula prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The study in the garden villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened a letter received today, which was sent by the high-level illusionist of Viscount Harrison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I saw Evans your paper, I have to say, some disappointment, you gave up your advantage in the field of elements and astrology, blindly involved In the field of unfamiliar electromagnetic waves, hormones and hallucinations, the paper is not as deep enough as Isabella, and there are more places beyond her to prove it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, your keen thinking on the arcane makes me admire, even in the field that I am not good at, I have made the result of creating a surname and breaking the surname. Maybe I should accept part of the illusion is electromagnetic wave, alchemy material two The result of the role... Some of your experiments are quite exciting. The transformation of 'Charming Humans' is especially amazing. Maybe you can make a greater contribution in the field of illusion after you understand and grasp the connotation of illusion... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Harrison chattered about his basic understanding of illusion, wasting more than 20 pages of paper, but also helping Lucy En solved some illusions Difficult on the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The debate over Isabella’s ability to win the Wizard’s title is getting more and more intense, and the Wizard House decided to recruit us for these high-level magic next month. The teacher discussed, I wonder if it will recognize her contribution. Unfortunately, your paper has not yet decided on the results of the surname, otherwise if they decide to compromise, I can propose that you share the title with Isabella, making you the best two in the last 100 years. One of the Arcanists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, keep in touch with the communication, everyone is close to the aristocratic magician."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House of the Wizards follows the conservative and rigid style of the ancient magical empire. They wait until the end of the year to review the achievements of the three major factions of the past year. If they are qualified, they will be awarded the Wizards' Crown, and they will not give up. Unlike the Holm Crown Awards, as long as there are enough important achievements to leave footprints in the history of magic, they will quickly enter the review and discussion stage, often in a short period of time – unless the results are not confirmed. Will wait until a few years later Issued when evidence. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the wizard’s house rushed to gather high-level magicians for discussion in the next ten days after the paper came out, clearly contradicting themselves. The style of doing things seems to be under great pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down the letter, Lucien took out the white paper, lifted the feather pen, dipped in ink, and prepared to write a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first letter is of course sent to the princess in the distance. After the mood changes, Lucien suddenly does not know how to write, a little expecting and uneasy emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't be too straightforward, you have to cultivate the atmosphere slowly, you can understand the thoughts of Natasha, and you can't talk about the problems of arcane and magic research. She simply If you don't understand, you will feel bored and bored. If you go on for a long time, you will lose the joy of communication. And it is easy to expose some secrets of the arcane..." Lucien calmly analyzes various problems, and he must not be like the jokes of the last life. Like the boys, in the communication with the girl, they discuss extremely complicated and boring professional problems...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my main life is arcane and magic research. "Don't talk about this, what to write?" Lucien bounced his finger and got into a problem, but soon thought of a way, "Don't talk about the professional problems of arcane and magic research, but can write and write in the study. Interesting people, interesting things, this is life. In addition, there is a discussion of music, a description of all aspects of the Holm Kingdom, and the news of Prince Patrick and the old king."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear The idea, Lu Xien began to write:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Become my teacher is the storm to dominate Lord Fernando, he is a very contradictory person, encountering arcane and When it comes to magic, it is very violent, very harsh, demanding, and the temper is very bad. Even if I am a quiet and cautious person who has suffered several roars, it is really a horrible feeling of storm, and other than that. In the place, he is very casual, and there is no limit to the humor of talking..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
