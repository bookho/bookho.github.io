			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Universe", Babel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien came back, Natasha stood in front of the "small live screen", staring at the front, constantly turning "the truth sword". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Lucien asked strangely, with her arcane level, not so much after a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the voice of Lucien, Natasha seemed to wake up from her dreams, and the silver-violet eyes radiantly said: "Although this delayed selection experiment cannot It is certain that the 'causal law' of strict time series can be destroyed, but I am thinking, is the 'sword of truth' based on this principle? 'The law of causality' is destroyed, so any means of resurrection is invalidated?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at her with a serious look, looked up and down her, and made her always confident and firm, she was slightly worried, I guess it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quiet and solid atmosphere took a few minutes, and when Natasha couldn’t help but continue to speak, Lucien suddenly laughed and laughed very much. Happy: "You want more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? This is not my strength!" Natasha is untouched, a natural appearance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien converges on a smile and gently sighs: "It is a great improvement to be able to take the initiative to think about the arcane principle of the blood of the sword of truth. Only by figuring out what it is, can you know how to go. Although I am not sure, there is a vague idea of ​​your blood power. When I come back from ancient hell, I may be able to tell you what it is. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Natasha was surprised and happy when she heard Lu Xi’an’s words. The next step in the Cavaliers’ path is the focus of her life. One of the "quiet" experiences of each month makes her understand that if you want to explore the road of your own knight, it is an indispensable premise to understand or figure out your own blood, otherwise at most it can be like "the heart of time" "It depends on centuries to accumulate as a third-order epic knight, and I don't even think about it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her knight who is good at fighting and stubborn, it’s a shortcoming to explore and study her own blood, maybe it takes a long time to understand, but fortunately There is a big Arcanist around, a famous arcane master known for research! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blurt out, Natasha noticed another key point: "Would you like to go to ancient hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She did not entangle her problems before, because she believed that Lucien would not deceive herself on such an important issue. He said that if he had an idea, he would definitely have an idea, and he would be clear when he returned from ancient hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two experiments this time made me gain a lot. After I build a few more magics, it is time to go to 'Ancient Hell' and go. To verify one of my ideas, by the time, everything has an answer." Lucien said vaguely, "The Lord of Hell" is stable in the main material world, but his true body is still in the depths of hell, so This time I went alone. Moreover, the current situation is undercurrent, and you can stay in Lentat in time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha licked his lips Slowly nodded: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear that although she has the shield of truth and the sword of truth, the actual combat power is equivalent to the legendary third-order, but In the face of the gods, it will still be crushed, and he is not a magician. There are not so many bizarre life-saving spells. Following the ancient hell will only drag Lu Xien. He is a legendary peak. Walk away, even if you face the gods, there are various ways to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, I will develop a new legendary spell that will help us cross-border 'communication' and, once there is an emergency, we can Notice." Lucian is trying to be prepared as much as possible, but he doesn't care. There is a speaker who sits in Aringe, unless Viking does not want to use God's death, or all the other gods join hands, otherwise there is nothing. What is worthy of cross-border notifications is that you are entering the ancient hell and you may encounter some strange things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"''Cross-border' communication?" Natasha repeated the word, with her knowledge, and never heard of establishing a stable door to the outside world. 'There are other ways of cross-border contact, so it is quite doubtful and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels based on the miraculous nature of microscopic particles..." Natasha was so stunned that she was sure to judge underground. Then she adjusted her mood and snorted. "You said that you have gained a lot from these two experiments today." What is it, what is it? Is the 'observer effect' affirmed, or can the 'cause law' be destroyed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can feel the curiosity she has been hiding He laughed and said: "The most important thing for me is that under such experimental design and conditions, these two experiments can be completed with electrons. Originally, I and the Speaker of the House of Representatives are going to use photons." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference?" Natasha did not understand, and she could understand the experiment. But the deeper problem involving theory is not her. Amateurs can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difference? This involves quantum field theory, wave dynamics, matrix mechanics..." Lucian deliberately cites a lot of theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"stop and stop." Natasha listened to her head and quickly stopped and transferred the topic. "In the first experiment, it was designed by experiment." The trace mark of the electron is erased, so that the experimenter can not get this part of the information, so the interference fringe remains, and the presence of the 'observer effect' is felt, but this cannot fully prove the problem. If the trace mark is not erased, But the experimenter was blindfolded, blocked his ears, and blocked the perception. Does the interference fringe still exist? Is there no 'observer'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lucien looked at Natasha with amazement, perhaps it was just not enough to understand the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and whispered: "Who knows? No one knows the result, because once someone observes, there is an 'observer'. If no one is observing, what is the result important? Anyway, there is no way to verify it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That assumes that there is a mysterious presence that does not cause an observer effect... Natasha played with her own imagination. "Would you just guess from the theoretical deduction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess?" Lucien laughed and laughed. "I guess there may be interference fringes, or there may be no interference fringes, hahahaha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked up at the ceiling and decided not to discuss with him. The problem is solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred calendar of June 830, the weather is burning, burning All things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The famous city of Syracuse, Anhaldur, Salvation Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An archbishop anxiously groaned in front of the prayer room, waiting for the reception of the Cardinal adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How the adults have not finished their prayers, and the new cults have been discovered in the nearby manor..." The Archbishop sighed back and forth while he felt his head sighing, recently In the past few years, the cults have emerged in an endless stream. They just hit one, and immediately came up with another one, so that the young and the strong themselves all whited their hair early. "And this cult seems to be able to summon high-level evils, adults do not It’s hard to completely annihilate the few people in the referee’s office.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the siege there is imminent, the Archbishop is more and more anxious, decided to strengthen the courage to knock The door is urging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, the Archbishop bent his finger on the door, but he just tried hard, and the door slammed back and opened a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not closed?" The Archbishop had a bad feeling, hurriedly pushed the door away and his eyes cast in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his vision solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the cross in the prayer room, a broken red cardinal robe is lying there quietly with strange burning marks on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, adults are swallowed up by the Holy Light?" The Archbishop whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his keen reaction, but in the last six months, along with the "Three Views Destroyer" Lucien? The results of the two thought experiments of Evans spread, and dozens of cardinals were swallowed up by the Holy Light when they prayed. Let everyone talk about Lucien? These two words, Evans, will be fearful and discolored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
