			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Carlylena didn't understand what it meant, her eyes were full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continues to be authentic: "But we are more suitable to be friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Carlyina's expression is a bit sluggish, her face changes again and again, and finally she is sad and sad. "That's really embarrassing, let Mr. Peter worry about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Her eyes seem to have a crystal clear reflection, and the mournful appearance can impress most men, but Lucien just smiles gently: "You are very kind to me, I am very touched, but you are not my favorite That type, I can only refuse to apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of dance music is coming to an end, Carlylena bowed her head, two drops of pearl-like tears A wonderful arc falls on the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blocked her nose and said: "I know that I am only a widow, not worthy of Mr. Peter, your promising knight. Anyway, I Just want to show your own intentions, you have given me an unforgettable touch. Thank you for accompanying me to dance this opening dance, and later welcome to the Ural City to be a guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The music stopped and Carlylena turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been burying her head, not letting people see the expression, causing Balshak and other people who pay close attention to this movement to glare at Lucien. They dropped their partners and wanted to comfort Calinina. Unfortunately, they took a slow step. Carlylena had already entered the ladies' makeup and dressing room in the corner of the first floor and locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Ballshak glared at Lucien, but he didn't know whether he should be happy or angry. In short, he had a sour taste and he was striving for it. The sweetheart was rejected by him so cherished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s because of the strength of Lucien’s knight, whether it’s Ballshak or anyone else who dare not ask for a duel on the spot, they are impulsive blood surnames young People, but it does not mean that they will stupidly find their way out. This makes Lucien happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the make-up and dressing room, Carlylena raised her head, and the pretty face was full of anger, and the white and neat teeth creaked. I hate the earthly: "I am a good person? I am only suitable as a friend? I am very touched by my kindness? Damn guy, you think I can see you! When things are over, I must let you know what is regret!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the underground cell behind the manor, Miyaka, who became the winter bear, woke up and saw his companion Niack next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, you are finally alive." Nyack put away a small box with a lot of potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miyaka asked a little confusedly: "How am I here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yaka, what have you been doing before? I told you to pretend to fail, not to let you commit suicide! Even if he is a formal knight, you are transformed into a good winter bear with a knight strength, how can he be cut into a sword like this? "Nyak completely couldn't figure it out. He stayed for a minute and felt that he had an absurd comedy in front of him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miaca struggled to reach out and touched his head: "He seems to be a knight in speed and agility. When a sword is cut, I can't avoid it. I can only rely on the fur to resist, and then I fainted, I don’t know what happened behind. The winter bear’s defense is not very strong? Is it not able to block the attack of the second-level knight?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that his sword is at least a second-class high-level magic sword. We completely underestimated his strength. I have to go to report to Mr.." Nyack discovered serious intelligence errors. Almost turned a hero to save the United States into a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After re-makeup, Carlylena ignited the mood of the ball with a warm and charming smile, but every time she saw Lucien It was only a slight nod, not saying anything, as if the previous "confession" was an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave Lucien a sigh of relief. He was just a "swindler" passing by. He didn't want to make a fortune and an affair here. He also hoped that they could transfer the target. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasten the night dress, Lucien went to the small living room next to the "housekeeper" Leo waiting for the place here, but unexpectedly found that he was gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, there is no gain, Lucien is preparing to look for it with a mental field. Leo flashes from behind a decorative pillar in the corner: "Master, is the dance party over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His wrinkled face was slightly distorted, like forcing something, while carrying fear that he could not detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo, what's wrong with you?" Lucien saw the butler and waiters waiting in the small living room and went to the room with their master. It was empty. No one, so he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo used his eyes to indicate Lucien: "Master, you look a little tired, it is better to go back to the room to rest early."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Lucien nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived at the third floor room, locked the wooden door, and checked the room carefully, Leo took a strong hate: "Master, I met that." Big smugglers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big smuggler who killed your family?" Lucien pushed the monocle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo nodded hard: "Yes, it is him. When I waited for you in the small living room, I saw him and his new assistant come in. Because of fear He was disguised as a disguise, and broke the lord's crossing of the Shahran Empire, so I sneaked into the corner. Then he left the assistant and went to the hall to attend the dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is his name?" Lucien asked with speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo’s voice is very low, and seems to be worried that he can’t control his emotions: “He changed his name, I heard the butlers of other nobles in the small living room and The servant called him 'Mr. Ivanovsky'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, he." Lucien gently squeezed his head. The non-noble staff known by Carlyle is either a fraudster or a big smuggler, indicating that she is mostly a bit problematic. I am afraid that it is not a manifestation of a simple widowed widow, and Sergei is probably Ivan. Nozsky's men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this way, Lucien has a lot of doubts. Since cooperating with the big smugglers, why is Carlylena willing to give herself a gift? What is worth living on her own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Frost" sword is worth more than 20,000 gold, it is worth the price of an ordinary baron, enough for most fraudsters and barons But Carlyleina inherits the inheritance of Baron Lotnoff, who has many manors and three mines, worth hundreds of thousands of Shahran coins, enough to rival a wealthy viscount. The annuity she receives from the manor and the mine every year is seven or eight thousand gold coins, and two or three years is a frost sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she is still the prostitute of the second wife of the Earl of the Ural, the lord of the Ural state, known for its ore, blacksmith and weapons. There is absolutely no need to seek a level 4 The long sword sells beauty to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not excluded that Carlylena is the kind of person who is greedy for wealth and does not cherish his body, but may have a small surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien without speaking, Leo whispered: "Master, rest assured, I will not lose my mind. I understand that you are in the Shahran Empire. Walking through is a huge risk. Since I signed the contract, I will not make a move that violates it and put you in danger, and you have saved my life. One day, I will pinch his neck." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo, I am very reassured about your character. But since I met, I am worried about what will happen, you tell me about him. "Lu Sien nodded with satisfaction, although he admired the character of Leo, but here is the Shahran Empire, it is impossible to risk revenge for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of big smuggler must have strong power protection around him, whether it is his own heavy recruits or his big bosses behind the scenes, the formal professional is absolutely not There will be less, I want to kill him, unless the fire is fully open and ready to set a trap in advance, which can easily reveal the identity of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of the night watchman of the Northern Church will not be better than the Southern Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
