			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time to stop! Oops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the brain pauses, "Hunter "The idea came out suddenly, but everything was too late. He didn't even have time to do anything to become a "mosquito in amber", solidified in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the whole world is stripped, the ash is like an old picture, and then the fresh life in the sight of the hunters is restored, gold, black, green, The red is re-rendered and his body is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“动?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not so clear-minded how he can see himself move? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the "time stop", he was still lucky, thinking that there are several pieces of supernatural items on his body that should be able to stop Three or four rounds of attacks within the "time stop" effect should be sure to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, why do you see your body vacating, then fall heavily, the blue light and black light flashes, but it is unable to stop "he" from falling On the carpet, a dull noise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hunter" looked back and found himself in a translucent state, being held firmly in the hands of the tall magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own soul is pulled out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring spells? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experienced "hunter" who battles with the magician probably understands what is going on, although he is not quite sure what the nine-ring magic is, but listen Through its effect, know that it can extract the soul from the body of the subject! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of your extraordinary items can't stop this weird spell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that he has no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has no mercy, no hesitation. The hand ignited a pale flame, burning the "hunter" painful screams, like being pinched into the body by countless fine needles, stirring up and down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he saw the holy light on the opposite "walker", offsetting a spell effect, but the little magician I also got rid of the "time stop", raised my hand and turned it into a gray stone statue before the "surrogate" reacted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando will be affected by the "time stop" effect. But he is ready. So it is much faster than the "surrogate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan made by the two, Douglas mainly dealt with the eight-level "hunters" in the time-stop effect, and spared the effort to consume the "surrogate". A life-saving item that weakens his magical resistance. Fernando resumed. No matter what else. Only attack "the agent". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where the knights and clergy are not as life-saving as the magician, Fernando is fully confident that he can’t get rid of between two or three spells and can’t escape. "Driver"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difficulty with this plan is that Douglas and Fernando need to trust each other, not only trusting the other party is not malicious. And trusting each other's strength, I believe that the other party can effectively complete the task, now it seems that the cooperation is good, so Fernando's heart has raised Douglas is still very good and very worthy of the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five silver-black magic missiles flew out of Fernando and hit the "revolution" changed by petrification, so the "stone carving" issued a crisp The cracking sound, the cracks spread from the outside to the inside, and then it quickly collapsed and shattered, igniting the flying dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the opening of the door to the present, it only took two or three seconds, but the two high-ranking powerhouses have been killed, one ** lost The soul, the empty body, one became a myriad of gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Benson had not figured out what had happened. He just looked at the change of light and shadow in front of him. The night watchman captains "lion" and "gatekeeper" were dull and had not got rid of Douglas control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secluded ray of light shot from Douglas's fingertips, hitting Benson, suddenly all his spell effects disappeared, all magic Can't show it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-magic ray"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benson!" Fernando turned his head and snarled loudly. He turned back to its original state, and the momentum was like the fiercest storm on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benson looked at Fernando with disbelief, and his heart was shocked and scared, and his ears creaked like thunder, and his mouth continued to whisper: "I, I don't want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, how could Fernando waste time, a silvery lightning bolt out of the void, and entangled Benson A thunder ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electric spark disappeared, Benson’s body fell to the ground, only the face was preserved under the deliberate control of Fernando, and the face was scared and solidified. His eyes are horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the vigils around the guards and the entire referee monitored the short battles through the divine array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Acting Master, Enemy!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to inform the activist, fully open the defensive array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the activist "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment, the night watchman, the interrogator, and the sentenced person are running around in panic, they have never encountered a situation in which the headquarters was attacked. I don’t know what I should do at all. I just follow the normal combat experience, avoid, hide, and look for opportunities to fight back. A few awake people can’t notify the “deputy” who has the authority to completely open the sacred array. Communicate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The activist is assassinated, go find the 'hunting hunter' adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The hunter can not find the adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who, who has the authority of the 'transfer' natural death after the death of adults?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaos is still going on. It’s hard to make an effective response after the referee of the 100-year-old referee is in the first place. After a while, someone thinks that they have the authority of the gods. If the "dealer" is killed, his assistant will naturally obtain permission from the divine array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Douglas and Fernando have left the referee, carrying the "hunters" and Benson's body, floating in the referee's air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Throwing to the entrance to the square." Fernando said in a soft voice, still feeling roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two bodies landed. Fernando's finger strokes, the blood of the hunter automatically flies out, and the word red bleeding is outlined on the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betrayal, die!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunter, die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, in the dark rain, Douglas will take a hand. The four meteors descended from the sky with a burning flame, and they smashed the second floor of the referee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent explosion occurred and the debris flew. The shock wave swept around. The small building, together with most of the buildings on the ground, collapsed and shattered, and most of the night watchers who had not escaped from the chaos became incomplete bodies, and only a few lucky ones survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the referee is located underground. There is also a separation of the gods. Plus the rain is like a note. When the lightning flashes and Douglas casts a "time stop" spell, the cardinal in the church is not aware. It was only when the "surrogate" died that he suddenly had a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
