			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Raven’s upright Master, who focused on arcane research, Lucien was sincerely respected and smiled: “Just got it” The Arcane Journal has not yet had time to read it. However, if you want to discuss this paper with me, that's fine. I talked to Oliver a few days ago at the teacher."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you discussed with him?" Lavin was a little surprised. In the impression, Oliver and Lucien had little communication. He shouldn’t talk to Lucien, but Lavendi. Soon, I thought of the reason. It must be the "hand of annihilation" to find the "storm dominated" discussion, just as Lu Xien was present, he took him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I figured this out, he waited for Lucien to answer, and eagerly asked: "Do you think that the material will have a length contraction relative to the 'Ether' movement? Is it necessary to explain the experiment of Lord Douglas from the perspective of 'ether'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is a relatively open-minded elemental mage who can accept atoms. Segmentation, but it is impossible to imagine that in the absence of mental integration, there is a contraction in length in motion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, this is just an idea. It is the same as the idea put forward by many propaganda proponents before. It cannot be because the proponent is a great arcian. "Looking at the difference." Lucien repeated the previous reason for answering his own students, and said, "And I don't think it is the contraction of matter itself. If this is the case, I tend to shrink the space..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding Heidi and Annick heard the conversation between Lucien and Ravendi and realized that the teacher had read the paper beforehand. No wonder A pair of calm and calm appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Despise you!" Heidi whispered silently in his heart, and then, like Katrina and others, listened intently to the teacher and Lord Lavendi. The discussion, from time to time, compares the journals in hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Lavin was interrupted by the satisfaction of the communication. Lucian looked up and saw the clear eyes of the six pairs of seeking knowledge. The expression is relaxed, it seems that the previous anxiety has been eliminated with his own views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I still don't understand here." Katrina hurriedly asked, the teacher still stood on our side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien explained the question one by one, Annick frowned, a little puzzled: "Teacher, you said that you are not biased towards particle theory. Not biased towards volatility? What exactly is that light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that Heidi and other people recalled the topic of being shocked by himself and others. They looked at Lucien with their eyes of confusion, doubt and worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about it and kept a serious attitude: "If you can let go of the original concept of volatility and particle theory, really Starting from the experimental results and phenomena, you will find that light exhibits obvious particle surnames, such as photoelectric effects, such as Brooke scattering experiments, and also shows distinct wave names, such as double-slit interference experiments, diffraction experiments, Brooke bright spots, Therefore, whether it is wave theory or particle theory, there are insurmountable defects so far, it is difficult to describe light completely. I tend to be at a higher level, the fluctuations and the particles are unified, but there will be different in practice. Projection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Lucien has elaborated on this issue in front of others, which is a psychological basis for his students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to Lucian’s explanation, Annick and others seem to be thoughtful, but the face is more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not intend to continue to provoke the wave war now, stay in time, prepare to return to the office, read this issue of "Arcane" carefully, a few days ago In the evening, his cognitive world suddenly appeared in a three-dimensional pattern that could not be seen clearly, as the teacher "Fernando repeatedly mentioned" the "new legendary occupational structure", which made Lucien suspect whether someone verified "new A prophecy of alchemy, but not the most important neutron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Wayne’s own “finding neutrons” is a question of repeated experiments, but now the level of magic has not yet matched the cognitive world, many common magics are I haven't learned yet, the foundation is very solid, and it is easy to leave hidden dangers in the cognitive world. The "new legendary profession" that was constructed in any case is not used for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to take a step, Lucien felt that the monocles were getting hot again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Have you seen the new "Arcane"?" This is the voice of Gaston. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and sighed: "After discussing with Lavindi..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; exchange for a while, Gaston explained his opinion, absorbed the advice of Lucien, and finally: "There is very little discussion with you about arcane problems, you are better than I thought, about Lord Oliver. The paper, what advice do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think his transform equations can be applied in many places, so I can study it carefully." Xi En made a point of mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon now hears the meaning of Lucien’s words, hehe smiled: “I also think that many research areas can use this equation, right? Lucien, you still don't know? The Arcane Review Committee discussed the decision. At your current level of arcaneism, you should not be responsible for subversion of the papers. You are a veritable authority and naturally take the paper review in the corresponding field. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What field?" Lucien licked his teeth, since the "Folk Arcane Masters" found themselves unable to make a breakthrough from themselves. The papers that need to be reviewed often do not have an article in a year, and almost forgot the identity of the Arcane Review Committee. After all, the papers that subverted the surnames are so many and so frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucien did not reject the committee’s decision, because being able to review more papers is also an exercise, a way to get inspiration and ideas, even those that are full of mistakes. A paper that cannot be passed may also bring a new perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon laughed: "All members agree that you are the authority in the field of elements, alchemy, heat and mathematics, all small areas in these four major fields. The papers may be transferred to you. In addition, you are also responsible for the photonics field of the light and dark faction, the papers related to X-rays, electronics, etc., without any problems?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; So far, although Lucien has also won the Immortal Throne Award and the Silvermoon Medal, no one really thinks that he is the authority of the Necromancer and the electromagnetic, let alone the astrology, the force field, which has no outstanding results. Illusion, change, and summoning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Lucian replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon praised: "Lu Xien, you are the best of the talented arcane masters I have ever seen. There is one more thing. I want to learn to form a research institute of my own, but in the microscopic field, there is an atomic research institute in front. The resources of the parliament will definitely tilt toward you, so I plan to go one more direction in addition to studying new alchemy. Don't know what advice you have? What other areas of concern for the elemental faction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien seems to have been able to imagine similar research institutes, research centers will be more The more the more, the magicians are not fools. After the new alchemy is proposed, in addition to affirming their talents, they will also see the advanced form of this research – whether it is the result or the fraud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien solemnly said: "I think that the research on synthetic life materials is far behind the current development of arcane, and it is worth exploring. Field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Gaston would like to thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending the call, Lucien smiled and looked at the students who had not left because of curiosity, and they felt their hair grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what's the matter?" The most daring Heidi asked a little trembling, wouldn't there be any exercises and papers? I am waiting for someone to become a mid-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Don't worry, find something for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried about this! Lei Yi Li Ya and Sprint are all bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have just heard it, I have to fully assume the duties of the members of the Arcane Review Committee, so as my students, you have to be like other members. The student is responsible for the review of the papers I assigned." Lucien closed her smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
