			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas's spear was blocked by "pale justice" and felt the power of the legendary field for the demon king, so instantly Backward, revealing a body full of abscesses, squinting at Natasha, who seems to be staggering even standing, spit out a word: "Your lineage is mutated? The heavier the injury, the stronger the strength?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn't talk any more, clenching the long sword in front of Lucien, it seems that the blood of this variation seems to be also The toxins of Limas have been suppressed, so that the power she re-born continues to flow quickly, so she can't attack, she can only defend first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her abdomen infected with toxins is difficult to heal, and a lot of blood loss also causes the body to be weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas sounds high and looks very nervous, full of tyrannical emotions: "Spell triggers, magic items stress produces defense, blood pulse ability mutates, you two Can't you kill me well? It's too odious, it's disgusting, what is the use of your resistance? Isn't it the same that I will kill? Is it not good for everyone to save time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is like a person who can't drink enough to drink three bottles of Les wine, the brain is slow and slow, and I don't want to think about how to deal with it, let alone show magic. Can vaguely feel the power of the curse by the blood, from the lungs, from the stomach to the neck, and then spread through the neck to his brain, and the power of this curse seems to begin to affect the body function, except for the left hand, the rest gradually appear Powerless symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must think of a way to get rid of this 'drunk' situation, or you will die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Absolutely can't give up waiting for help, so 99.99% will die before the arrival of the reinforcements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha It’s dangerous!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chaotic idea emerged in Lucien’s mind, he waved weakly, trying to capture the inspiration for getting out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when there are two dagger-sized swords in their hands, covered with a layer of dark green decaying liquid, dripping from time to time. On the ground, an area was blackened and corrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all you don't cooperate, you have to be punished!" said Pirimmas, and then began the wind at a speed that Lucien couldn't capture. In the rainstorm attack, a surrounding area gradually became infected with creeping black, distorted dark green, and disgusting yellow, so that all people entering this area will be cursed by curses, toxins and diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the semi-illusive will field that the 9th-level gold knight has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking into the "pale justice" in Natasha's hands, Pilimas did not attack positively, but relied on the suppression of speed and will, constantly searching for Na The gap in Tasha's swordsmanship, and then two stabbing swords sewed a wound. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha has the ability to mutate blood and blood, but the strength is far less than that of Pirimas, and it is "powerless." The kiss "infested, and it is not bad to be able to play one-third of its own level, so it can't keep up with the speed of Pi Limas, and can only use a long sword to passively defend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten seconds, Natasha relied on impenetrable defense and "pale justice" to suppress the blood of the devil and the evil field. Blocking the "venom devil" attack, as time goes by, the effect of "powerless kiss" becomes more and more obvious, her strength is gradually weak, and there are many loopholes in the sword curtain. Opened the safari, tore the skin, rotted the muscles, and there were another shocking wounds on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stimulation of the wound, Natasha’s strength recovered a little, but the breathing became heavier and heavy, like a tightly stretched bow, no Know when you will be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Pirimas flashed "Pale Justice" and deceived her in front of her with a strange posture with her back facing Natasha, right elbow He slammed into the back and hit her in the middle of her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the sound of the rows of ribs broke, and Natasha’s mouth was filled with bright red blood with silvery purple. She only came back. The sword slammed, blocking the next attack by Pirimas and the whole man flew out and slammed into the wall next to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pirimas was worried that he would be stunned by the "legendary sword" that obviously restrained the blood of the devil. Therefore, he did not let the opponent run out until he died, but to save himself, not to be wiped by "pale justice." At first, if not, Natasha is already dead in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't stand up now?" Pirimas said with bloodthirsty, then screamed nervously, "You, you still What do you stand up for? 乖乖 lie down and let me kill!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi’an looked at Natasha’s side and stood up, mixed with blood. The sweat dripped on the ground, and all of them were rotten scars, but they still steadily raised the long sword and made a guardian posture. The heart suddenly became sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless I die, I can't cross me half a step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsettled, Na Tasha’s voice was not so weak, but the weak situation did not change in essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hates his incompetence at this time. In the absence of mental strength, he can only be regarded as a half-knight, unable to insert high-order battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must get rid of this dilemma!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be mentally restored!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To restore your mental strength, you must first remove the curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to remove the curse ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien's head is congested with blood, thinking slowly, feeling the power of the curse flowing into the mind through the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I announced that the object I hate most has changed from a magician to you! The more severe the injury, the stronger the blood is too disgusting!" Rimas thundered, but this did not affect his strength, but it was more bloodthirsty and crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger of the spirit, the chaotic blood features, did not let Pirimas lose the basic knight judgment, still just like the speed and agility of the wind Rainstorm-like attacks, bullying Natasha to protect Lu Xi'an, bullying her power is not good, mobile inconvenience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the silvery blood dripping on the ground, Lucien is like hearing the countdown of Natasha's life, a desperate and self-hatred Feeling awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Lucien, such desperation is not accompanied by giving up, but by reflexive unyielding, the spirit of never giving up is played. The moment of the Symphony of Destiny is integrated into his soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irritable, anxious, desperate, self-abandon and other emotions have disappeared, even though Lucien’s brain is still in a state of “drunk”, numb and dull, and because there is no The interference of negative emotions restored a little thinking ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the curse seems to affect the body and soul by affecting the brain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is integrated with the blood of the body, with a steady stream of follow-up force, and then enters the brain with the neck as a bridge... My mental strength is overwhelmed sooner and later into the 'drunken dream'... This may be the Pirimas The longer the time is said, the better the effect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficultly analyzing the process of the influence of the curse, Lucien could not find a solution to it. The way, because the need to remove the curse requires magic, and now is cursed by the curse, it is difficult to cast magic, so it fell into an infinite loop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other way?" Lucien looked at his body and found that only the left hand still had strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Left hand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not affected by the power of the curse!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep pupil of Lucien suddenly zooms in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, with the pong, Natasha was hit by the Pilimes on the wall again, but the soundproofing and the defense of the secret room made the outside aristocrats Not aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
