			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Six or six Arcanists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph stunned at the present The familiar "Bolaq" is like looking at a completely stranger, no, he is a stranger! Even if he is hidden deeper, Borak’s age and his experience of not leaving Anti-Feuer are definitely impossible to become a high-level Arcanist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this must be the high-level magician or the Archmage transformed into the appearance of Borak, in a special way through the Earl of Nuremberg Blood tests, mixed into the underground palace to find the secret left by the Sun King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he almost flashed a blank picture of his mind, flashing a picture before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you smugly show off the existence of another secret room, show off the secrets of the Sun King hidden in it, show off how to know how to open the secret room The "Bolaq" in front of him answered with an unusually sincere answer:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, thank you for telling me this secret."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am stupid, really..." Ralph raised his unspoken eyes and muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he wants to shout out, reminds His Royal Highness, Deni, Alten that they are "counterfeit" and are high-ranking arcane counterfeiters. I really want to turn the anger in my heart into a "Bolak" that is magically vented in front of me, but he also knows the horror of a high-level arcane master. He can lift his hand or stare at him with ease. Let yourself fall into the abyss of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the place, including the crazy day knight who just "promoted", and the prince of the prince who used the order balance and the princess who has no other cards, Even if they join hands, it will be killed by the high-level arcane master in half a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only way is to choose to surrender, choose to wait, and wait until the "Glory Crown", Mr. Midarun, according to the time agreed in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you encounter a high-level arcane sneak in? It’s like a lion in a group of sheep!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph is unusually annoyed and fearful, the whole body is chilly and trembling, and the mental power cannot be condensed. Even if he has the lofty ideal of standing at the top of the magician like the Sun King, the strength of the second ring is still Remind him at all times that the most important thing at the moment is to become a middle class as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road needs to go step by step, even if you know the secret of the Sun King, his greatest hope is only to exchange the power of the six-ring magician. Into the higher order, become the strongman of the Duke of the Golden Sparrow, get glory and status, did not directly look to the legendary field, after all, the Sun King also grew up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, standing in front of him is the "high-level magician" he dreamed of, which makes him dare to resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-level high-level arcane masters often mean the magic level of the seven rings and eight rings, and may even be the nine-ring master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s wise." Lucien looked at the smack of sweat in front of him, and his face was pale and ugly, and smiled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph nodded sillyly, and then saw the blue eyes of "Bolaq", the sea became more and more quiet, deeper and deeper. Deep, more and more quiet...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph, who is in a state of loss of control, is easily "controlled" by Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five ring illusion, dominating humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing that the "Beltralang" castle devil event was the test of his teacher's storm, Lucien also knew the "disgust" he encountered. It is the small crystal Affris "play", but the special summoning ceremony and the devil ghost are real existence, and are closely related to "Fable Fable"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the story of Fernando and Aphrodite, Lucien learned the rumors of the seven mysterious devils in the deepest hell, and the current gaps in their research, according to The two "experts" speculate that after a long-term, repeated accumulation of negative emotions can not be vented, a corresponding devil will be projected inside the heart, without any ritual assistance, and the subsequent ritual steps are more enhanced. Projecting and letting it draw strength to grow, so there can be no substantial magical meaning, only those who need to hold the ceremony can believe it from the heart, so that the most spoof and most inexplicable ritual can also "call" the ridiculous devil. Amazing events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to say, the steps of the ritual are not important. The important thing is that the ritual itself, without it, the projection of the devil can not draw strength and shape, and more importantly, the accumulation of negative emotions in the early stage, otherwise The devil can't project it, what to call? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When "abducting" Borak, Lucien wanted to cover up the truth with mystery, and secondly, it was a bad taste, so I chose the seven devil legends. "Greed," and he made a funny ritual in accordance with the game of the earth lie to girls. At that time, Lucien was very determined, not thinking of Borak, and Frederick who witnessed the ceremony would follow the "ritual". Summoning the "greedy" devil, after all, they have lost a key step like "Fable Allegory" and less long-term repeated accumulation of "greedy" negative emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, Frederick actually succeeded in summoning the "greedy" devil by "the greedy ritual of peeling the apple skin" and "getting" into the The power of the Knights rank! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he still has a certain gap with the real Knight, but the strength has already increased, and the strange face, Lucien thoroughly believes that Greedy "the masterpiece of the devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply incredible, completely beyond Lucian’s expectations, this is only a month’s time, where was the normal Frederick’s accumulation So strong, so indifferent greed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he saw that Borak "successfully" summoned the greedy devil, he believed in the ritual from the heart and put down all the guards and will resistance? Or is the underground palace another weird? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever reason, Lucien had to speed up the action, even if he exposed his identity, he must also shoot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is no other eccentricity in the underground palace, according to the fighting experience of Affris and the "Abomination" devil, it is likely to change with time and kill. The stimulation of more blood, the increase of negative emotions of oneself and others is getting stronger and stronger. Maybe in a few minutes, Frederick has the strength of a real Knight, and he cannot watch himself in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to clean up hidden dangers is the best option! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just judge from this ten-second battle, I still have three to four minutes of free time. Start the magic array first, so that there is no time to complete the task after exposing the identity. And can still explore the secret of the Sun King without any worries." After Lucien controlled Reliff, through the secondary mind connection confirmed that he and Midrand did not find another secret passage and the inner layer of the palace, so I carefully examined the bloody secret room and confirmed that it was empty. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sophia showed the magic to match Frederick's opportunity, Lucien continued to use the resident phantom and gasification form, silently flew into the Chamber of Secrets . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Frederick, Lucien is more worried about "Glory Crown" Midrande, now that he is not in the secret room, things will be easier too much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the Chamber of Secrets, the bloody smell and the foul smell are so full of irritability that Lucien falls to the oil painting of the first Duke of the Sparrows. I whispered a long spell and matched it with complicated gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the metal is screaming outside, the others are kept away from the chamber by bloody smell. For 30 seconds, no one heard the micro-room The sound of an inaudible spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long spell from the Rhine reverse cracking of the entrance to the magical array, and the transparent Lucien flies directly to the oil painting, and then strangely Into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a not-so-long secret passage, and it is officially opened with a mantra and gestures. Lucien enters the inner layer of the palace without any obstacles. The inner layer exactly the same as the lobby above! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the hall, there is a sun altar, and above the altar, stands the statue of "Sun King Tanos". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man with a high head. It seems that there is nothing worthy of a look at him except for the innocent starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tanos" wears a solemn black-red magical robe with a magical crown set with many gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
