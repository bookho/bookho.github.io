			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand is usually firm and powerful, can accurately dissect the body into different parts, can complete the gesture of any difficulty, but now it is completely out of control and trembles Even if it's just ready to flip a thin sheet of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Desolation! Inferior! How can this paper be published in the newsletter?!" The wind is overflowing, the dull and dull sound sounds, it seems to contain endless Anger and hate, "Lusien Evans? X, the elemental will, the bastard who doesn't understand the mystery of life, dare to question the composition of the human body? If you let me see him, he must teach him a good meal." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men Shak forgot that the briefing was just a newspaper sharing the research of each group, and there were no reviews and standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I want to experiment immediately and poke this despicable lie!" Menshak jerked up, using the body's refining facial muscles and The cheeks seem to be unable to suppress the black bones that are hidden underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar scene also occurred in most of the research groups, Larry was sucked up by milk, and the cough was shocking. Timothy was already pushing glasses. Excessive force, the glasses frame reached the forehead, and Ulysses sprayed the pieces of bread chewed in the mouth with a briefing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Arcanists who are good at the elements are shocked, and then they are gloating to end the breakfast and use the experiment to verify that the Necromancers are different and angry. The ground shredded briefings, there was an anxious place to turn around but did not dare to do the magic experiment to negate, there is a forced suppression of unstable emotions to inform the pale hands of the high-level, there is full of hate to want to teach Lu Xien......... ... In the magic laboratory, when a loud bang and a slamming metal object landed almost simultaneously, Mensake solidified and floated in place, the red flame in his eyes dimmed almost to extinguish, and looked at it in a dull manner. The experimental utensils and white slightly red solid particles, holding the magic tube that was crushed by his living hand in his right hand. The glass slag that had been treated with special magic was put into the palm of the hand, but still could not evoke any reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Menshak whispered to himself: “No, no! It must be that my experiment has gone wrong, how does human life mechanics say? Wrong?! This is not logical, which is not in line with the many human body magic that has been built on this magic theory for so many years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why this experiment can Synthetic urea with non-living matter? It has no vitality to be integrated into it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menshaq’s schizophrenic geological questioning, arguing, like whispering, It was hard to calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a period of time, the flame of life in Men’s eyes slowly recovers, and after a while, he is afraid of the earth: “If the cognitive world collapses, the mental power will Losing control, frying my body and soul... Fortunately, I am not too old-fashioned, and I remembered that Mr. Rogerio once said that urea is not a living substance in a strict sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, is human life mechanics really correct?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be transferred to this research project to explain Menzak's arcane level Not bad, when the initial shock was subsided, he subconsciously doubted the basic theory of the Necromancer, and similar things happened more than once in the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it comes to the theory of human life mechanics, Menshak feels that the flames in the life of the soul are violently shaken and seem to be extinguished directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I can't meditate this time, keep calm." Menshak understood that this was caused by inner conflicts that he could not find, only Can end with time or more powerful evidence. Of course, it is unclear when the human body's life mechanics is said to have won a great victory, the contradiction is naturally eliminated, or the self-construction is overcome, or the cognitive world is re-constructed, or it is unacceptable for meditation to be difficult or even completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not need to breathe but is used to surging in the name: "If I can't beat myself, then I will defeat Lucien? Evans, I can't move forward, Don't want to live too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Rogerio’s early prevention and urea’s impact are not enough, the oldest Necromancers in each research group have no There is a tragic thing in the meditation world that is completely chaotic, and the mental power is out of control and exploding his head. But most of them are excited and angry that if they have serious consequences, they will definitely not let Lucien? Evans is a bastard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking time to go to the bathroom and using a morning crystal to perform astrology, Lu Xi'an concluded that the front was dangerous, but there was a smooth way to avoid most of the difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Felipe doesn't know how many days to submit a paper..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road When Sean thought about it and returned to the living room, he accidentally discovered that Exeter and Elstin were seriously looking at the briefing in front of them. Their eyes were confused and their emotions seemed to be not stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been using astrology for more than ten minutes. What happened?" Lucien tried to greet him, "His Royal Highness, Princess Her Royal Highness." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksi Lyons looked up, beautiful and delicate as a woman's face has a deeper disgust and hatred: "Mr. Evans, you can synthesize urea You overthrew the theory of human life mechanics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you understand the magic of the Necromancer?" Lucien asked in surprise, the two elves could understand the arcane paper? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The message that our guards received from the great elders." Exxon obeyed politely and answered subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin hates the voice: "Whether humans, cows, sheep, all kinds of Warcraft, or plants, you can get a natural gift to have vitality, how? It is possible to synthesize living matter with some gas and some ore?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It depends on how you define the material of life..." Lucien understands this. In some Druid concepts, life is composed of living matter and has nothing to do with non-living matter, but it seems that their concept is not the core of their induction and use of natural will. It seems that there is no cognitive contradiction. Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter how you define it, Mr. Evans is an evil, awe-inspiring devil!" Ellers whispered to Lucien The last trace of good impressions also translates into the most negative senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also a 'devil', hey, two 'devil' are waiting for you." Lucien had no thoughts and two elves controversy about arcane problems. My heart silently said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Pesor slammed the briefing on the desk, and the two souls in the deep eye socket of the white skull screamed fiercely: "The road Sean Evans submitted the experiment of synthetic urea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Tina Dimos and two other members of the Arcane Review Committee The Necromancer system is a relatively enlightened existence, so the professor's thing, the soul of the dead dominated the arcanist did not conceal them, explained them to them in advance, so that they were psychologically prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the person who is the teller is the master of the dead, he has the highest authority in the mind of the Necromancer, and the four members themselves have good arcane thinking and Ideas, so they didn't take long to basically accept the experimental facts and reversed the effect by fine-tuning some magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roserio, who is opposite Pesor, is extremely gloomy: "It should be that both Felipe and Lucien Evans were attacked." The professor has been vigilant and suspicious, and may even have thought that we are close to success here, so we will test this experiment in advance by our own disciples. Even if we don’t decide the result of the surname on this side, it is also the Lucy that attracts hatred. En? Evans, if he can, he can add his name through the disciple and share the Arcane points. Pesor, Tina, you didn't see Lucien? Is Evans hiding the experiment in the project outcome paper?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio, who was informed of the news, rushed to Felipe to the town of Sariva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation in Menezes is not very good, we must solve this matter as soon as possible." Tina Dimos looked at other pale things in the room that knew the situation. Hand high level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menises is another member of the Arcane Review Committee and is the authority on human body refining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio smiled bitterly: "In Heidler, Aurelio’s mood is also very violent, not like a Necromancer, it looks like he I want to kill Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aurelio is another high-level manager of the pale hand, a member of the committee, a sixth-level arcian The Seventh Ring of the Necromancer has great potential and has been studied in the Half-Secret Magic Tower of the Semi-God Lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
