			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two guests, are you looking for me?" Nodaniel saw Heidi and Katrina coming towards himself, and then pointed to himself in confusion. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi smiled kindly: "Nodaniel, your speech about the balance of nature was really great, it’s so interesting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She perceives that Nodaniel is a relatively cheerful surname, so she greets her with a familiar look, and does not politely call her or her lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Heidi’s sincere and straightforward praise, Nordenielton was a bit shy, slightly swayed and waved: “I just put the elders to elaborate the concept. Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Heidi, this is my companion Katrina. I just went to the forest today and I am very happy to meet you in the first place." Heidi's growing enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not as introverted as Annick, and she is very generous about introducing herself to Nodaniel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a talkative and unstressed guest, Nordaniel’s heart was so nervous that it quickly vanished and the conversation became natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, we are commissioned by Her Majesty to investigate the magic of a few elves. We have some questions about Ties, I want to ask you." After a while, Heidi asked directly without a cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodaniel was silent and looked stunned: "Heidi, Katrina, what's wrong with this, you guys, I hope you can Find the source of the fall, let them kill them, and if they can't recover, don't suffer from it any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is there before the fall? What are the signs of abnormality?" Katrina asked in accordance with the criteria of Urisian, Felipe and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordaniel is a sly elf with a ** skin and brilliant blond hair. It looks quite noble under the sun, but there is no smile on her face. In terms of recollections, he said: "At least for me, there is no strange thing in life before this. The partners also hunt every day, picking fruits, looking for places in the forest where the balance may be broken, and then feeling Naturally, I understand the magic, choreograph the dance, sing the music, and read the various books after the mythology..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so calm, so Leisurely, such a beautiful life seems to never be broken, but: "Last morning, I suddenly noticed that the magic lines on the skin of Tsui have changed, full of hatred and killing feelings. Yesterday was still good. We danced together the special dance she had just learned and said good night to each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special dance?" Heidi recorded Nodaniel's answer on the magic notebook. To the crown "Special" to describe the dance with concern subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodaniel nodded slightly: "She said that Ms. Martha taught her, I will show it to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and Katrina half of the survey is half curious and replied at the same time: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodaniel took a few steps back, no In the case of music accompaniment, it dances very rhythmically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dance has a lot of eccentric movements, almost contrary to the normal physiological conditions, that is, the elf body is soft, flexible and exaggerated, can barely do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the action is very strange, I have to say that this dance really looks good..." Heidi moved his left hand and legs, and there was a dance The urge, but she slaps her face in annoyance, and after I consider going back, I should not prepare a bottle of medicine to stimulate my blood, otherwise it is impossible to learn this dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina gave Nodan Neal a tempo and secretly connected with the soul: "This dance belongs to the type of sacrifice, giving me a strange feeling, waiting for the summary information. At the time, the key point is to mention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dance, Nordaniel seems to recall a friend, gradually emitting a sad and mournful mood, so long after a long time Come over and whispered, "Is this dance ok?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Nodaniel nodded and promised, Katrina continued to ask: "Is there any change in Tsui’s mood a few days before the fall, or has there been any change in concept?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nodaniel carefully recalled: "She feels a little lost, because the magic pattern grows slowly, there is no substantial breakthrough, so I said to me very seriously, I want to be a druid, learn natural magic, to maintain nature. The balance plays a greater role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Play a bigger role in maintaining the balance of nature... Heidi frowns down on Nodaniel’s remarks and asks at the same time Road: "You are a druid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, just become a natural guardian, that is, the middle-level druid in your mouth." The identity of "Nature Guardian" is quite proud, and the haze between the eyebrows has disappeared a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves are not classified as low-medium-high, one-two-three, like humans, but the hierarchy is the same. "Natural Guard" is a druid apprentice, " The Friends of Nature is the first-class druid, the "natural guardian" is the middle-class druid, and the "sticker" is the high-order druid (including the nine-level). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi was interested in the Druid profession, so he got a deeper understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Every elf can sense the grace of nature, so it can be a natural guard without any hindrance, then we need to put ourselves to nature The realization of sublimation into its own ideas, carried out in its own constant actions, with the integration of ideas and nature, we will form a 'natural heart' similar to your cognitive world, which is named after the core of the elves Is the basis for the application of official magic..." Nordaniel did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people talked for a long time before they were separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Heidi and Katrina returned to the tree house with a magic notebook full of harvests, with Yuris Ann, Felipe, Annick, Summary of intelligence from Sprint et al. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special Dance...Mrs. Martha..." Ulysses recited these two nouns. "There are more than seventy percent of the fallen people with special Dance-related, 30% is to follow Ms. Martha, the rest is not clear from where to learn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe voice is low: "It may be the custom of the elves, they are very passionate about dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, we will meet Ms. Martha tomorrow." Yurisian Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Annick said with shame and dignity: "Will it be a dance similar to 'Vicken's special summoning ceremony', there is no strangeness on the surface , focusing on the ideas or emotions that are instilled and formed in the process of learning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi has just cracked such a case, very sensitive, serious location Nodded: "It is possible, natural hate, hate, I remember that one of the ancient devils is called 'disgusting'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that the demonization Eighty percent of the elves are natural balancers, and the remaining 20 percent are still swinging between the two factions. The real natural hateful elves fall little, otherwise the elves of the elves will have long been aware. It’s weird...” Yuris Ann looked at the data table in front of him and licked his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, Natasha, Atlante check " After the heart of nature, under the leadership of Malfurion and Lanhill, he went to the “Prison” and tried to find clues from the fallen elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Prison" of the Elf family is still a trunk that is connected by trunks, but this part of the trunk is iron-gray, as hard as steel, with special characteristics of the trees themselves. For the sake of this, there is also a relationship between natural spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill asked the two elves who guarded the "crison" to open the door, and then entered first, and there was a loud and horrible roar, like a night forest. The "mourning" of the beasts inside makes people feel scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guardian elves have a sorrowful expression, and they are their companions, not beasts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, Natasha, and Atlante stood outside a cell and looked at the fallen elf inside through the cracks in the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems like the pattern on the back of the human face spider..." Natasha said in the mind line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the wizard's magic lines and skin have signs of arachnid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world that is clean for the green!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All wisdom lives to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen elf girl rushed to the edge of the trunk. His eyes widened and he looked at Lucien and others. Her pupils were not smart. Only the deep tyranny and destruction meant that there was a solid red in the center. At the same time, she opened her mouth and the teeth bite on the trunk. It seems that there is no way to use spell-like and talented abilities, and you can only rely on such primitive means of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rows of teeth that were neatly white and clean, this moment is like a white bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature Balanced..." Malfurion introduces the identity of the Elf girl to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror scenes that Lucien and Atlante have seen are numerous, and they are not affected by this kind of scene, and they use magic to check the situation of the elf girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and Lucien succumbs to the extent of the fall of the Elf girl: "The basics are definitely related to the contamination of the Elf tree, but not Knowing the cause, or the result, the prophecy can only tell me that all the fallen elves have deep commonalities under the surface, which is the key."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this respect, I will let Ellerstin cooperate with the magician to investigate. The two will first go with me to the abyss gap?" Lan Hill suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian nodded without objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, because Lucien suppressed the fallen power, the elf girl’s eyes suddenly cleared a little, holding her head in pain: “Why is this! Why? This way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a green glow, a touch of quietness flowing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi'an's face changed, it was to stop, and Malfurion sighed: "She is so painful, let her free, and Other fallen elves can investigate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl has a beautiful melody in her mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every elf is a tree, come to nature, return to nature..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are born from love and union, we are calm and serene Going back, we sing for the forest, we are happy for life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ethereal song, the green light on her body is getting rich, then Mafari Austria opened the door to the cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl danced like a dance, and gave a deep ritual to Lucien, Natasha and Atlante:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every elf is a tree, rooted in the earth, breathing the sky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are guarding Naturally, maintaining balance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flew to the outside with difficulty, her body wrapped her green light, and then slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every elf is a tree..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song is getting smaller and smaller However, it is melodious and reverberating, the green light disappears, and there is a tall and beautiful tree in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every elf will turn into a tree after dying, so they love green so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be sure to investigate the reasons for the fall." In this scene, Natasha clenched her fist in her right hand and said to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
