			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purado and the teacher completed the experiment together, looking at the sunset like a burning fire, lazy and relaxed, unprecedented satisfaction, his next research direction has been determined That is to find the neutron to confirm Lucien? Evans's theory of material change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that it was difficult for him to enter the legendary field like a teacher and become a lord, but now, the emergence of new alchemy has made him see hope, at least more than the past. May be bigger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a contradictory smile that is both pleasant and exciting, Prado mentions the quill:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An alchemist, please allow me to pay tribute to this paper to the author of this paper, Lucien Evans, the dream of countless generations of alchemists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lucian Evans started from the actual existence, through a rigorous deduction and reasonable deduction, made a huge and detailed description of the internal structure of the atom and the surnames thus expressed, and constructed a Fundamentally explain the theoretical system of alchemy reaction, ionization theory, atomic valence state, elemental period law, elemental spectral line, and this system elaborates the essence of the element, and uses the traces of new elements found in the material of the surname as evidence, reasonably Analyze the mysteries of material changes and predict several ways to change substances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Mr. Lucian Evans’s theory is confirmed, then Is the element and alchemy field since Lord Hathaway Great achievements are enough to change our times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the minds of alchemists like me, this is the fundamental code in the field of elements and alchemy, far away More than any glory in the history of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the establishment of this theory depends on the confirmation of many predictions, I can not directly put such praise on On the head of Mr. Lucian Evans, he was not able to get the title of the Great Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the present, this is an attempt Fundamentally expounding the theoretical system of elements and alchemy mysteries, and having precise experimental confirmation and rigorous self-consistent logic in some parts, is the result of creating surnames, breaking surnames, extremely important surnames, highly discussing surnames and popular surnames. I suggest Reward 5,000 arcane points and 100,000 arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an excited mood to finish the assessment results, Prado looks out to the outside to start the bleak sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sky is getting dark, but when it lights up, it will be dazzling glory." His tone is full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the "Guardian of God" against the siege of the Arcanist Enchantment, the Glorious Cathedral only destroyed the core and was not completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-winged knight who can rush to see this scene, but his eyes are covered with a bloody fog, his expression is abnormal, because the core part is guarded The cardinal and bishop who walked and lived were undoubtedly destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in order to guard against the powerful magical parliament, the Holm parish in a certain sense dominates the parish of Calette, the parish of Calais, and the parish of Burriana. The four parts of the North Coastal Corridor are concentrated in a large number of cardinals and bishops, most of which are in the Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the incomplete statistics, at least three nine-level cardinals, fifteen ordinary cardinals, nearly one hundred bishops swear by the body..." Bahá'u'lláh's voice seemed to blow from hell, cold and painful, but he did not dare to care about it, but also to open the transmission array to guard against the magical parliament attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that he had only laughed at Lu Xi’s glorious record not long ago, Shi Dong’s willingness to restrain himself could not restrain his anger, almost gnashing his teeth: “Lu Xien Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has known the culprit from Bahá'u'lláh, and this degree of loss, even in the Twilight War and the North heresy war It is also rare, even if the Southern Church claims that the middle and high ranks are equal to the sum of the Magic Council and the Northern Church, but the area they rule is also broad, and it is necessary to draw enough people from other countries and from different places. It’s really heartbreaking to be stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is more heartbreaking than this, Philip Bell has actually reduced the order, a legendary strength loss is far more than other losses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously aging a lot of authentic: "I have already told the Pope to the matter, the war will be unavoidable, and the password for Lucien Evans will also be released."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now don't look for a chance to kill Lucien? Evans, do you have to wait for him to become a great arcane master and legendary magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the "new alchemy" is mostly realistic, then Wayne? The future of Evans will be very bright! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we wait for the orders of the Pope." Stone used his will to restrain his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filier Bell added a sentence: "My strength is not enough to support the Holm parish. I applied to the Pope and asked him to send it." A stronger cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Filibel..." Baha'u'llah has some sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky begins to dim, and the night comes earlier than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rigorous Lavendi uses the magical array of elemental will to improve, Two experiments were completed separately, which confirmed the discovery of protons, and the existence of new elements was relatively simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feather pen, and Lavin’s eyes suddenly appeared in the scene when he first saw Lucien. He wore a black double-breasted long dress with the same color bow tie. Quietly standing in the "Elements and Alchemy Conference" responsible for the reception of the low-level magician, in addition to more temperament, looks more handsome, it seems that unlike other ordinary magicians, I can not think of just a few years, he Expected to win the title of Archaeologist, perhaps around the age of 30, he will be the eighth arcanist of the parliament, "creator" Lucien? Lord Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Red Moon, the torrent of the times..." Lavin said silently, and then began writing the review results for the 9th-level Arcanist, The nine-ring magician, who specializes in elements and alchemy, the emergence of "new alchemy" allowed him to see the possibility of promotion legend! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the introduction of quantization theory and the verification of experimental results on the structural model, this is undoubtedly an elemental and alchemist faction. The essays are the Holy Scriptures in the field of elements and alchemy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As long as neutrons can be found, and humans change substances without relying on a constant magic array For a long time, the new alchemy of Sean Evans is enough to change the times and change the direction of elements, alchemy and electromagnetic magic. Perhaps the form of electrons and nucleus is still around, but other parts are completely called To be reasonably self-consistent, Lucien Evans elaborated on the definitions and phenomena in the reaction of elemental magic and alchemy, so that they are no longer isolated, but truly constitute a complete system, with a theoretical support system. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only give assessment based on the results of existing experiments. This is the result of creating a surname in the atomic field. It is extremely important to break through the progress of the surname. It is of great value for discussion. It has a popular surname that is promoted to every element of the elemental and alchemy factions. It is recommended to reward 6,000 arcane points and 100,000 arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Finally, this is the epic surname of the magician stepping into the restricted area of ​​the gods, and the authority of creation is in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night outside the window is dark and twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Cardinal Mission quietly await the appearance of Pope Benedict II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the power of tyrannical, majestic, sacred, and light spread, and a feeling of high above them oppressed and they lowered their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Evans' new alchemy steals the authority of the Lord and must be punished, and the magical council that is sheltered must also be punished!" Pope Benedict When the second levy of the scepter went out, the tone of anger appeared in the tone, and it was no longer calm and calm as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope has never seen such an angry sorrow, the members of the Cardinal Mission are facing each other, to steal the authority of the Lord, to blaspheme the gods, before Douglas, Brooke, etc. And the results of the miracle experiment have similar descriptions. They are only a little lower than the "new alchemy" that claims to be able to control the authority of creation in the future. It is not the same as calm and calm, but what happened this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
