			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe struggled to lift the left hand with only four fingers, pale as if the face of the dead had a gloomy smile: "You submit the paper on synthetic urea first. Because it is not perfect enough to determine the surname, it will lead to a big discussion on the theory of human life mechanics. When the old guy who is stubborn is more stubborn because of the argument, I will throw out the result of determining the surname. Although it is not really life-like as human cells. The artificial synthetics may not be able to blow them up, but it is only because the human body mechanics is overthrown that they can make their strength stagnant for a long time, even stuck here forever."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This discussion can bring you a lot of arcane points in a short time, more attention to the will of the element, is this not a benefit? And Traquill is also ready to kill you, is it? You don't want revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I submit a paper on synthetic urea? There is a periodic table, and I don't worry about arcane points before the fifth level. ,with I have received enough attention within the will of the element. For the little interest, I will carry the hatred of the church and many Necromancers. Any time I go out, I will be afraid of being attacked by people. Are I so stupid?" Lucien scorned The ground moved the mouth of the painful heart. "Felipe, do you think I am so greedy and stupid?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s gloomy smile is not Change, the left hand of the raised hand slowly bends: "Professor, do you think that you can escape if you refuse to cooperate? I will thank Lucien at the beginning of the paper. Evans? X, thank you for inspiring me, thank you for your outstanding contribution to the creation of surnames in overthrowing human life mechanics. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer, seriously looked at Felipe and began to consider killing his viable surname.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the premise is that you can recover faster than him, this point "Element" ring works well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, you didn't watch come out? My body will collapse at any time, and the soul and body will resurrect in another place. Even if you recover now, you can't kill me unless you have several unique high-level means. "In the second confrontation with the professor, I have the upper hand. Felipe is quite good, but he didn't know what the card was.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not With this magic effect, he has long been killed by Traquel, and even if Traquil knows what magic, he may find the corresponding cracking means.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled without smile: "Mr. Felipe, do you know that I have no choice? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loser does not lose, the momentum can not fall under the wind, if his own "曰之冕" and then unravel the two layers of seals, there may not be no way!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe feels guilty, teaching this guy mysterious, there is no hidden means, but he is still confident and calm on the surface: "I just help Mr. Professor, imagine the possibility ahead of time, and then discuss the ways that are beneficial to both parties. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" For example, this research project, I read the briefing a little, probably knowing that the soil lacks nutrients, and urea is a useful supplement, the difficulty lies in How to mass produce, Mr. Professor, your synthetic urea experiment is very inspiring. You can submit it as the result of this research, a word does not mention the theory of human life mechanics. After the discussion, you will not be good at the Necromancer. You don’t know anything about it, don’t express your opinion at all, and then I will throw out the decision to surname the experiment and attract all hatred to me, regardless of the church or the Necromancer. I will definitely not pay attention to your little introduction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the Magic Council, the only professor I have seen in person, I will hide my identity for you. I don't think you want to be known to the church and other members of the Magic Council. The professor is the great musician Lucien. Evans? It will be very difficult for you to meet with your Princess Royal Highness in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can get a lot of Arcane points, can retaliate against the attack, but also hide the secrets and not hate, are these benefits not enough?" As for Mr. Rogerio, they will only put the hatred that caused the big discussion on the 'Professor' rather than Lucien? Evans. If you still feel unsatisfied, then I promise that when you or your friends need to prolong life and increase the strength of the soul, I can help you with a magical ritual, of course, only once. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe is very dissatisfied with his assassination by insiders, and Traquil has blew himself, no direct evidence, no matter which The top executives will return to the old guys. After all, they are high-level. To think of this, you have to look at yourself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s simple and straightforward to talk to Mr. Professor, you are such a character.” Felipe was so gloomy even with a gratifying smile. “Let’s find a chance to sign a devil contract in these two days.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he gave up control of the body, the body began to disintegrate, and the flesh and blood of the pieces separated and rotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before disappearing, Felipe seemed to use the vibration of the soul to speak in a speech: "Mr. Professor, this cooperation does not mean that we have become friends, you are still One of the guys I hate the most, if there is a chance, I won’t let you go. But before that, I hope that you can grow up quickly, or else you will defeat or kill a magician with only two rings. There is no sense of accomplishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also, I hope that Mr. Felipe will not be overtaken by me." Lucien responded with a calm smile. At the same time, seeing Felipe's left hand lacking a finger, a burst of milky white light illuminates him, and then disappears out of thin air. Only the immortal throne charm made of white bones and another ring-like magic item fall to the ground. Did not disappear with his disappearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nine-ring magical life hiding?" A unique necromantic magic on the Book of Necronomics is now in the mind of Lucien, "but the effect seems to be No. Life occlusion is to isolate most of the vitality to a part of the body and take it down to hide somewhere, so that it will not be killed by ordinary magic and knight attacks when going out, and will not appear on the verge of The state of death does not coincide with the disintegration of Felipe and the disappearance of the soul. Is it a unique magic of the pale hand? And which Archmage helped him to hold a magical ritual? Hey, I have never heard of it. Who is Felipe's teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While slowly recovering life and spirit, Lucien looked at the "immortal throne" talisman on the ground and thought: "Threats I? Should I give you a 'surprise'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the masters and high-level magicians who focused on defending the church's external attacks discovered that they appeared inside. The situation, a short distance teleport, there are elemental will of Ravendi and Gaston There are pale hands of Peisuo Er and 蒂娜迪莫斯 and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do with your pale hands?" Seeing the undead wreckage and the hard standing Lucien, Raven turned and paled. The hand of Pesor and others roared, the air suddenly became hot, and the surrounding seemed to be turned into magma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sign before his signature nine-ring magic "Raven's Flame Hell". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesol is wearing a black robes to cover the whole body, but the standard white gimmick above the neckline, can’t see anger or doubt, only two The red flame, which represents the power of the soul, keeps jumping, and the voice is sullen and cold: "Raven, a magician of the elemental will and a magician of a pale hand, was attacked by a Necromancer. I want to be a victim of our pale hands before the investigation is clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an eighth-level arcian, nine-ring necromancer, arcane The members of the audit committee, the surname is not good, and the other people dare to snarl at themselves and let the other party ugly, but the opposite is Laven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesol said that he pointed to the immortal throne on the ground and held it and the magic ring in his hand: "'Resurrection'? Felipe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon checked the scene, briefly asked about Lun, and turned to stop the raging Lavindi: "The attacked It is the two winners of the Holm Crown Award and the Immortal Throne Award, Lucien Evans and Felipe Carneiro, the attacker is the pale hand of Traquil. Mr. Pesor, you Do you know the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tina Dimos, a look of hell, is not very nice. "We will check it out!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Hedler" in a magic tower secret room, a box full of beautiful jewelry is placed in many magic arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, it illuminates the eye-catching clean white light, a finger flies out and floats in the air, then the finger is like a big knight to recover the body wound Stopping and squirming, getting bigger and bigger, finally turned into a naked man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is exactly what Felipe looks like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to ask the demigod lich to help me hold this 'life occultation' that combines the ability of cell memory recovery. Every time I hold this ritual, I will Going bankrupt." Felipe looked up and down on his body, then lifted the magic array and went to the bedroom to change clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
