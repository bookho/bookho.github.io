			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street of Coser City, Lucien and Simon, Joanna, and Betty walked slowly toward the gate, and there was a god in the sky. The eagle flew over, with a parcel tied to the back and a large basket of fresh meat on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, are you really leaving Coser City today?" Betty looked at Lucian with regret, if she said Lucien When she recognized her identity, she still had some doubts. With the registration of "Moonlight", the musicians of Kuser City tried to play the latter two movements, and she completely believed that this elegant, gentle and gentle Mr. Evans was in front of her. It is my favorite musician, the music prince I often dream of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of all kinds of complicated piano skills, or the beautiful melodies of brisk or short storms, and the fiery passion, the high-spirited will is all Showing the unique style of Mr. Evans is undoubtedly another excellent piano sonata that can impress anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous stroll, Lucien has seen the mark of the magic circle in the city of Coser. Due to the accidental death of Hunter, the invitation was postponed for three days. Change, so I smiled slightly: "I still have important things to do, I can't stay in Coser City, and I can't hold a concert. Betty, you can train Knight, if you can become a real knight, maybe we can still Meet in Aalto. If this is the case, then I will play you a song in private."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Betty Surprise, this is The musician she admired and her own small agreement, so she was full of motivation, nodded, "I will train hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joanna and Simon whispered together: "Thank you Mr. Evans for inspiring Betty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a little gift." Lucien turned In my body, "This journey with you is a thing worth remembering, well, I Leaving the city of Coser."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Lucien disappeared in the afternoon sun, Simon did not wonder why he dared to hurry alone, nor did he Strangely clear that it is close to the evening, he still insists on starting. According to him, the reason why he hired the adventurer squad was because he was lazy and quiet, and he needed people to help with chores. Now he is in a hurry because of the encounter with the Barber Castle of Habero, busy on the road, naturally relying on tough The strength crosses the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In retrospect, these eleven days are really like dreams." Betty muttered, clenched, and full of motivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon and Joanna agreed to nod, then pinched the body of Kintal, and began to think about which aristocrat to look for to guide the regular knight training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Coser City Musicians Association Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar stood in front of the counter and looked at the place where Lucien wrote: "Cris, we might as well replace it with steel, then Another statue of Mr. Evans, um, is the way to write the score. Then, the genius musician Lucian Evans is here to write the famous piano sonata "Moonlight". This should have a lot of noble The big lord is coming to the guest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien refused the concert and invited the guest to stay, he had other inspirations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Chris was still a dreamy smile, looking at the front with no gaze, not hearing Caspar at all. Say what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caspar didn't mind, touched his chin, frowning and thinking, and Kliss's head was not talking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a musician association’s personnel returned from the outside: “Caspar, I have arranged Mr. Wise to live in the villa. You still What's the order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, don't bother me. Chris, how do you feel about adding Mr. Evans oil in the hall?" Casper completely Wavelessly waving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the third Wednesday of July, the sky was suspended high in the silver moon, swaying with clean and cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lushing, who is bathed in the moonlight, is wearing the mountains and forests quickly, and can see the beautiful mirror-like lake outside the castle of Callanderia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, professor and musician Lucian? Evans appears in the Djibouti Principality at the same time, always making subtle associations for those who know, but directly as a person to deal with, still need a very bold imagination, because there are many reasons to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is still as Lussian saw last time, standing with many claw-like spires, the dark appearance is always so heart-wrenching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the grass outside the gate, there are already many mysterious people wearing black hooded robes waiting there, Lucien swept over and felt at least Three or four hundred people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few very special among these mysterious people, wearing various magical robes, not covering their faces with hoods, and showing their faces brightly. They have men and women, and the common feature is that they are sullen and sturdy, and they are dull, and they are surrounded by another nineteen black robes into a loose circle, chatting with each other. The rest of the people around are far away, leaving a clear distance, as if they are very afraid of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should be the official magician, using the "masking technique" as a ring of magic to change the look." Lucien, who is also a formal magician, quickly judged For the reason, "But if you encounter mental strength or the will is higher than your own two-level powerhouse, the 'masking technique' will be directly seen through, and the more than a dozen black robes who should be official magicians will not use it. Some of them are likely to be middle-level magicians, not worried about people under the high-order powers to see their own disguise." Lucien himself did not dare to use cover-up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After clarifying that the 23rd were official magicians, Lucien was slightly surprised to think: "The whole Wilfrid leader has this. Magician? Maybe someone still hasn't arrived?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Wilfrid collar includes two principalities and a suburb of the central and southern parts of the continent. Far more than the Vaurit Principality, the combined knights are estimated to have three or four hundred, but the magician is only twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without concealing his figure, Lucien came out of the dark shadow and walked to the gates of the city of Karendia, attracting many black robes. Looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be no obvious signs on the body that make people unable to judge whether they are familiar with them. They slowly turn back and talk to their peers, not to ignore this stranger. Guy, many people who come today are not aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty more magicians looked at Lucien and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly walked to the four magic apprentices, calmly looking around and listening to their conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dialogue full of words such as "corpse", "eyes", "resentment", "undead", one is obviously too fat to push the black robes The tight magic apprentice noticed that the quiet banqueter next to him, holding the idea of ​​exchanging materials, etc., said: "Hello, we are magic apprentices from the southern mountains of the Djibouti Principality. Which country are you from? "What do you call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from Kazan, you can call my codename 'Professor'." Lucien in multiple sets Take the intelligence of the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazan is the country opposite Longya Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it turned out to be a guest of Kazan. You can call me 'fat.'" The obese magic apprentice and his companions apparently have not heard of "professor "The nickname," they are 'stone spots', 'bread' and 'red wine'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the "fat", a little doubtful about him The obesity is disguised: "I first attended such a banquet. I didn't expect to gather so many magicians and magic apprentices. I don't know how many have not come yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short and sturdy "bread" whispered: "I just heard the magician who brought us over and said that this is probably the most magician and magic apprentice in the three countries nearby. Only alone Studying or small circle research, no contact with the big environment, no one familiar with the small part did not come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Master..." Lucien Oh, I didn’t expect that the original Wilfried’s surviving magic apprentice would be so few, just the territory of Viscount Stanley of Korser City. There Knight attendants strength of close to a thousand people could. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
