			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s mouth was pumping, and it was wise to end the topic. This light is a simple description that makes people feel dizzy or handed over to the Arcanist. Let's understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and down Lu Sian, half curious and half asked with concern: "In addition to the cognitive world, to the extent of the nine rings, What harvest? I heard that Hathaway’s mother-in-law and her mother all said that when we study similar results, the cognitive world will interact with the corresponding principles of the real world and produce different spell models. You just made such a big move, there should be a few A new magic is born? About time and space, quality and energy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive world changes are the main advance signs of the wizard, semi-essential Corresponding to high-order, substantive corresponding to the Master, semi-cured and can project and influence the real world is corresponding to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the prototype of two legendary magic, the quality is transformed into energy." Lucien understands that it is an incomplete magic structure of fission and fusion, time and space Although the structure has changed, there is still a lack of theory that can directly affect them. At the very least, you can optimize the magic of “time stop”, make them simpler, easier to learn, and truly get time and space. Legendary magic, probably after the time and space of general relativity or quantum mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the structure of the two legendary magics of fission and fusion, that is, Lucien can be obtained, because he proposed the nuclear model, proposed decay, know this Two phenomena, also know the chain reaction, for others, even if the quality formula is derived, the relevant knowledge must be mastered, so that the corresponding research can make a breakthrough, then the interaction can be generated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s attention was immediately drawn: “Legendary Magic? No wonder... Lucien, what name are you going to take?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth of a legendary magic is always not easy, and witnessing it is a feeling of witnessing history, especially the creator is in his twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans's little boy? Lucien's big Ivan?" Lucien replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the not-so-complete spell model, fusion magic is currently at least a legendary peak to be built into the soul and does not hurt its own use. The deeper the knowledge, the greater the power, the lower the degree of need, but after thorough understanding, the magician who has the lowest level of legend can use the remote projection magic, spell increase, spell delay, purification materials, etc. Cooperate with release. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fission-like magic can be constructed after the relevant experiments and spells are completely analyzed. If there is a purified material, the Jiuhuan also hopes to display it. When I think of it, Lucien’s thoughts are flying: “I don’t know if the fusion magic is beyond the level of the gods, can it become a flash, gamma ray storm... that is really destroying the world...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha listened to these two names and suddenly looked at Lucien’s lower body with a smirk: “I think these two names are not very good, it seems to indicate something. The two different situations, or change it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was suddenly stunned, it really is "gentleman" Natasha, worshipped Dao: "The spell model is still incomplete. Please consider the name after the supplement is complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will help you take one of the legendary magic. The name, my literary accomplishment is good!" Natasha decided to take this fun thing into her arms, but she I left Lu Xien with a heart, "Yes, what kind of magic is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien roughly described it again, heard the last Nata Shake couldn't help but turn her head and look out at the night outside. She couldn't help but scream: "Maybe you will have the title of Sun God, Eternal Blazing Sun in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To achieve a similar level, I feel that even at the level of the god of truth, we should not be able to do it..." Lucian answered honestly and continued to subtly change Natasha’s religious views. Let Him truly degenerate into the spiritual realm. This is a long-term and arduous task concerning future happiness. Lucien is always working hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seriously thought about it: "From the power of that god drop, it is far from the end of your description [***] Elephant, but perhaps it is the result of power convergence and precise control. Unfortunately, your 'little boy' is not complete, and there is not enough purity and quality of the casting material, or else it is a magic trap that is cursed and dark is a nuclear explosion. Look for another opportunity to use the Ring of Congas with the use of the ring, maybe we can kill the demon lich once again, it is really safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Things will never be as smooth as we think, and I am only aware of the essence of the world. The spirit is still at the level of the Seventh Ring. It is also a quasi-seven-ring magician who has not yet constructed a seven-ring magic. There is still a long way to go, even if this time, due to the rapid increase of the influence of the two kinds of gods, I estimate that the mental strength will reach the level of the Eight Rings in a week. If you want to promote the Nine Rings, you will have to wait a few years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien objectively assesses his own state, without frustration, smiles and says: "Our original purpose is to wear the 'Congrave's Ring' to enhance survival. Hope, as long as this goal is achieved, then there is no regret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is said that this paper will be directly given to Congas, he is also possible Will directly explode his head, completely degenerate, but Lucien believes that after the previous two losses, Congers certainly can not confuse to pick up their own things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Lucien wore the quaint black iron ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just as close to the flesh and blood, it begins to absorb the spiritual power of Lucien. With the rapid flow of mental power, the cognitive world begins to fluctuate slightly. The space and mapping have rapidly increased mental capacity and delayed this flow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the crazy suction gradually calmed down, and the surface of the ring iron black faded and faint, emitting a faint cold metal luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien moved his body and was pleasantly surprised: "The magic resistance and physical defense, physical fitness, etc. of the Ring of Congas can be superimposed with other magic items. It just can't exceed its upper limit. It's really an 'artifact'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Lucien has eight magical resistance even if he does not change his body. The five-ring knight physique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And immunize and weaken a lot of magic." Natasha looked at the ring of Congas with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Immune is not omnipotent, can be circumvented, such as not directly acting on me, but affecting the surrounding environment, and then I am hurting me with the environment, and wearing this ring, I can't apply magic defense to myself. The spell trigger prepared in advance is not affected, so I still have to choose whether to wear it according to the situation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you can now use the legendary magic. We are not as weak as before." Where are we going?" Although the time is close to the early morning, the distance to the demon lich There is still a day to come, but Natasha understands that there is more hope for a little more preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Mo squatted on the ring: "A legendary magic should be able to drain the strength of the ring itself and my mental strength, so you must grasp it. Opportunity. Now, let's go to Death Valley to 'see' El."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you not wear the ring yet? You don't need to catch El." Natasha has some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed: "El is a bit weird, you have to probe it, so as not to be an accident, and because I wear this ring, I have to catch El. The half-god lich will never think that I can materialize the cognitive world so quickly. When we see that we are with El, you say that he will guard against the use of legendary magic?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a mysterious existence of Aitna and the Necromancer, Lucien dares to discuss how to calculate the legendary magician, otherwise maybe the plan has just been worked out, there is a half god The demon feels as dangerous as the last dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really blackmail." Natasha exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's go." Lucien closed the alchemy platform and the paper, suddenly, thinking of what he asked, "Natasha, Did you say that I made a lot of noise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha definitely nodded. "When you write a thesis, there are weak changes in time and space. Feeling, and when I finished writing, the outside night was a new round of sun rising directly. I was afraid that the monsters and beasts were still 'sorrowful,' although it lasted only one or two seconds. But I am sure it is not my hallucination,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be?" Lucien is very surprised, and it is not the case that the world should be semi-cured. Did you start to influence the real world? I can still be far and far from the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked helplessly at Lucien: "I am completely out of this matter. Hey, maybe this world is special, even the spirit and will are suppressed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Lucien began to think about this, but there was no clue. At the same time, he noticed the glory of the name of Natasha’s left arm, and his mouth was secretly pumped. , decided not to remind Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha noticed Lucian’s gaze, his head turning and looking at his left arm: “Is this the name of the gods?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you see?" Lucien was even more surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha blinked and didn’t understand why Lucien was so surprised, a bit innocent: “I can always see, others can see, what happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not true. In the main material world, people who do not have special methods and special items cannot see the glory of the surname of God." I believe that Natasha will not deceive herself. It was the case that El provided the Laurel box, just because Francis and Jacob could not touch the glory of the surname of God, not that they could not see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it is special in this world." Natasha still uses that reason, she is really not good at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a few steps back and forth: "The speciality of this world... The glory of the surname of God is in accordance with my hypothetical system is the convergence of special electromagnetic waves, how can we make Anyone who doesn't have a way to see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s flash of light flashed a guess: “Maybe because of this world’s smart creature The magnetic field of the body and soul is slightly different from the main material world. Their 'faith power' is stronger, easier to diverge, and because the pseudo-god here does not have clear teachings and rituals to guide, so the 'force of faith' Special electromagnetic waves have lost most of them, and they have been in the air, causing serious electromagnetic pollution. They have suppressed the mental power that may also be electromagnetic waves. So, the external release of the will is also due to electromagnetic waves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same is also due to the special electromagnetic waves that permeate this different 'band'. When I realize that the world changes, it resonates with some kind of electromagnetic wave from the outside world, so there is an abnormality. ”<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, real-world projection interactions, what is the new spell model? Perhaps the previous speculation is only a small part of the fact, not all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance of Lucian’s contemplation, and hearing his muttering, Natasha smiled and said: “This is definitely the deepest mystery. It’s impossible to explore it, slow. Slow research, then find smart creatures to study the difference in their magnetic fields."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the most important thing is the half-god lich." Retract the thoughts and signal Natasha to leave and go to the Death Valley. At this time, Natasha smiled like a fox: "I think of one thing, the god of love and beauty, Ashin seems to be It is a male centaur, and the body can be used as evidence. After he merged with this part of the surname, he turned into a beautiful lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that she While curiously rubbing the glory of the surname of the left arm, although she could not touch anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't think about it." Lucien looked at her seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed twice: "Is that kind of girl with a surname? God's surname and you know the world conflict, how can I bring it? Hate you. Well, I have to ask Hathaway's mother-in-law to create an extraordinary item with this god name. Are you talking about earrings, rings, belts, headwear, or long skirts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long sword." Lucien said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha snorted: "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use high-order pseudo-god The long sword created by the 'Soul name' must be only a day knight or a talented ordinary knight to take it, so that no one will take it wrong.” Lucien continued to answer without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled: "Alright, what is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
