			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Commissioner’s Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus once again picked up the journal Nature, which was dropped on the desk, and carefully read Dieppe’s thesis from beginning to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he is more focused and more energetic than the review, so that most of the time, only use black gloves to gently tap the desk: "If you will see the electronic For the wave, the problem of the electronic level and orbit of the new alchemy has a direction of interpretation. It is no wonder that Lord Lucien Evans will value Dieppe's hypothesis in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the inner thoughts, not afraid of being known by others. Therefore, Marcus, who instinctively dislikes the theory of light quantum, is not willing to call Lu Xien as a lord. When he thinks of this name, he will think of his theory of relativity. The important role of electromagnetic phenomena in the motion system, as well as the description of the nature of gravity that has to be admired by worship, has added a lord to the subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, this assumption is still too bold, and there must be experiments to confirm." Marcus put down the journal Nature, left the committee office, and returned to his own The Magic Tower, talking to himself in the mouth, said, "The authority and pillars of particle theory rely on electronic waves to correct the energy levels and orbits of electrons and perfect new alchemy. It is an excellent irony. When he proposed the hypothesis of light quantum, he wondered if he thought that there would be such a day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Arcanists who have experienced baptism again and again, Blind from the opinions of others, I believe that without verification, it must not be able to live to the present, therefore, although Lucien’s fierce arcane master has the absolute authority that has been correctly shaped again and again, but the horse Cous will not easily agree with his point of view. All experiments are based on experimental phenomena or data. The only influence of Lucien's editorial editor is that he will bring the focus of this paper to the highest, which is the closest to the microcosm. Pathways and roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really designed this experiment and verified the electronic fluctuating surname, you will get an unimaginable return, and you may share the real world with Dieppe. Feedback and Evans Arcane Award! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength, reputation, future, status will be greatly improved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yana looked at the "Nature" in front of him with a smile: "This is really unexpected. Lord Evans has given such a high rating and is encouraging everyone." Is the idea broad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electronics is a wave, this is really an era of fantasy. Whoever dare to say that the atom is a wave, whoever I have to bear the ridicule of every arcian, and now, oh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t mean ridicule, but expresses his heart in such words. Shake, then dizzy, fell into meditation, seeking ideas for design experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the electromagnetic faction magicians who are so pleased with Diyap’s hypothesis are such attitudes, and other unacceptable arcans, not to mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Element will headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry, K, and Gaston also watched this issue of Nature fall into a state of sorrow. After a while, Larry smiled bitterly. "Is it too conservative? Or is this world changing so fast that we can't keep up with the pace of the times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think anyone in the entire parliament Can keep up with such a pace." Gaston shook his head. "Lu Sien should have seen the dawn of solving the electronic model of the new alchemy from this hypothesis, which gave great praise, but he himself To put it bluntly, it must rely on experimental results and phenomena, and now all this is still blank. Whether electrons are waves or unknowns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say this sentence Whether it is talking to Gaston or listening to Larry and K, I feel that there is an indescribable quirk. When is the "electronics are not waves", the things that are difficult to connect with the subject and the object are quietly mixed together. Together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weirdness is like someone saying that humans are composed of waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K nodded and scratched his head: "If only because of a hypothesis and the approval of Lucien, we will change our point of view, then our point of view There is no point in view, and all current experiments have fully verified the particle name of the electron. There is no doubt about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although starting from this hypothesis, it is not a matter of short-term results to build a theoretically perfect new alchemy, and the electronic wave surname experiment shows signs of improvement in the future due to the wavelength problem, but Gaston can't help but worry. At that time, which one of the two basic theories of the elemental and material fields is abandoned? Particle theory, or new alchemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really an era of change and eccentricity that makes people difficult to adapt." Secretly sighed, Gaston decided everything was subject to experimentation, himself It is only in this way to grasp the pulse of the times, and to be prepared to recognize the current model errors of particle theory and new alchemy, but in this way, before finding the road, my own strength may be stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry also sighed: "If you really verify that the electron is a wave, I can’t understand the world. What is the wave-grand image? There will be a wave of two elephants, oh, it’s not that I am too stupid, but that world is too crazy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar, Heidi, Annick, etc. all took the "Nature" journal in a daze, and rarely got into work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien, who came in from outside the door, woke them up and surrounded them all. He was eagerly asked by the always bold Heidi: "Teacher Do you agree with Mr. Dieppe's electronic wave hypothesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If light has a wave-particle two-image surname, why can't it be generalized to microscopic particles, and this can Turning the quantization imposed in the new alchemy into the surname of the electronic guilt." Lucian, who had not had time to take off the black top hat, thought about it and decided to clearly explain what was not obvious in the Dieppe paper. Come out, "You first let go, I will explain slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artisan who is good at electromagnetics and fluctuations only needs to see Dieppe's thesis and his own Comments, and contact with the current bottleneck of the new alchemy theory, can be directly thought of if the electron is a wave, then how to deal with its orbit model, whether it will naturally derive the energy level and orbit of the quantization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With doubts, Heidi, Ophelia and others slowly dispersed and followed Lucien into the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, this is a hypothesis that has not yet been confirmed. We must hold a high degree of suspicion. You are not willing to blindly believe my comments. I am very pleased." Lucien first affirmed the attitudes of Annick, Lowell and others, and eased their irritable mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien puts the hat on the conference table: "But this does not mean that we can't try to apply this hypothesis to solve some problems virtually to broaden our thinking. If this hypothesis can answer some of the current contradictions well, then we have to go back and pay attention to this hypothesis and give it more attention. Based on this, I make such comments."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If electrons are considered as standing waves, they are bound to the nucleus and they must have an integer multiple of their own wavelength to exist, so that the orbit of quantization It is no longer imposed on the electrons, but on its own guilty surname..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucian’s remarks, Sprint and others The new alchemy debate and the perfect arcane masters nodded slightly. The problem of imposing quantization on the accusation of Hathaway has always been something they can't avoid. Now it seems that there is a solution, even Black and Orpheus. Leah and other participants are less involved, mainly reading and learning papers. Also we have similar feelings, can in this direction, why should the particle theory at the expense of the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, all the experiments we completed have undoubtedly confirmed the electronic particle surname." Annick euphemistically expressed his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and nodded: "I have not denied the electronic particle surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So how could it show a fluctuating surname?" Under the drive of Annick, Sprint and Katrina questioned at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed: "Why can that light show both the particle name and the classic diffraction and interference pattern?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is probably another reason for particles to exhibit fluctuating surnames in some form of organization, such as positional vibrations, or fluctuations that supporters think many waves are wrapped together Form a node to represent the particle's last name." Annick is not shy and retreating in the arcane discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
