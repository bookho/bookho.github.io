			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, who got the piano piece "To Alice", was satisfied, but she did not prohibit Lucian from going to her study to read the book. She is now on the road. Sean's creative ability is very confident, and he hopes that Lucien can draw inspiration from those religious books, epics, folk heroic poems, historical documents and knight novels, and write classic works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien went to Latava Palace to read the book every Tuesday and Thursday, and waited for 11 o'clock to discuss with Natasha. Music, do your job as a music consultant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, what are you doing?" In the study, Baker, who translated dozens of pages of books, walked back and forth to relieve fatigue, and unexpectedly saw Lucien in Organize and copy books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wrote a beautiful line of beautiful words on a white paper in fancy style before raising his head to answer Baker: "I am working on these historical documents and Poetry is organized and summarized so that I can find creative materials in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have known and got along for nearly two months, because of Baker’s old-fashioned conservative, Lucien He did not become familiar with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker heard that Lucien was sorting out, curiously holding a stack of thick white paper in his hand and looking through it. After a while, he took Deeply confused and said: "Evans, the way you organize it is very strange, it is like a general history from the dark ages to the sacred era, and as if it is a biographer, the clergy, the emperor, the king, the duke, The stories of the Earl's heroes all blended in, as well as the changes in culture, law, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because for my creation, the story of each epic character More importantly, it is more clear and clear, and it can give me more inspiration." Lucien smiled and answered. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Baker suspected Lucien’s memory and told Natasha some time ago, let Lucien be a little vigilant, become a knight and a magician, and the memory is better. It is normal, but a large part of my own powerful memory performance comes from the soul library, which is beyond normal and has to do other things to cover up, such as the talent and unique ideas that have been sorted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien simply sorted out the historical documents in Natasha’s study in the form of historical records, but there was no history of “Tai Shi Gong”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucien’s explanation, Baker nodded and accepted that highlighting heroes is a major method of opera, novels, and music creation. The literature only needs a little change of thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it carefully, very seriously and seriously: "I feel that following this kind of thinking, I have a new direction to record history. No wonder Evans's memories of historical materials are so clear and fast that there is a talent for this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current historical record is still the chronicle, with the most Famous biographies and war epics, and the form of the biography used by Lucien is novel, but it is not shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Natasha suddenly walked into the study, heard Baker’s words, and curiously asked the reason, then laughed and said: “Lu Xien It turns out that you really want to be a historian, but it is best to separate the different positions of the clergy, the emperor, the duke, etc. The etiquette between the nobles is very strict and cannot be mixed together."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Lucien didn't think that he really wanted to get a history book out, just cover up his problems with the innovation of the inductive form. "His Royal Highness, haven't arrived yet." At eleven, what are you going to find in the study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha told Baker to continue to translate the book and took Lucien to the corner of the study. Smiles are brilliant, but another "you know" expression, slightly wretched: "Yesterday is Silvia's oysters, no banquet, only two of us, she is the one to "Silvia "The piano piece is very satisfied, saying that this is the simple music she has been trying to find. I am this morning. After complaining that she is your work, she is not angry. On the contrary, I am very grateful to you. I want to invite you to visit her house tonight, only the private banquet of me, Kamil Aunt, Silvia and Silvia." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this kind of thing, Silvia will be a little unhappy." Lucien "normally" discussed with Natasha. In this regard, "the works created by one's lover are very different from those created by others. Especially if you don't explain first, if she is not angry, it can only mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Lucien, "Don't always mention this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, my historian, will you attend the party tonight?" Natasha laughed and pulled back to the topic, and she invited Lucien very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not quit, anyway, in the Jisu District, very close to his home, not to delay the study at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At 7:00 pm, No. 78, Jisu District, a light yellow two-storey villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of the building is bright and soft, and there are several flowers in the garden that are not afraid of the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, Lucien." Silvia and her father opened the door to the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears an elegant and elegant white dress, and the night-like deep, silky smooth hair is scattered on the shoulders, completely dissipating the gentle and pure unique temperament. Out, it is definitely the lover of most male surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her father is wearing a black dress jacket, two black beards are thick, seemingly old and gloomy, but it can be seen that he must be a young man Beautiful man, the facial features are as deep as carvings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small gift that Lucien will bring to Silvia: "Happy, sylvia. Good evening, Mr. Drony." At the same time, the heart was slightly puzzled, why did Silvia's father, De Niro, give himself a faint strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Lucien, although they live in Jisu District, but I am seeing you for the first time today, you are younger than I thought. Oh, I can often hear your first major in the G major serenade at the banquet in the last two months. It’s very fun. Everyone is guessing when you can write the following movements.” Drony politely smiles and smiles . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossie led by Silvia and walked to the living room sofa, Natasha and Camille had already sat there: "In fact, it has been completed. It's a string quartet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I hope to hear it at the New Year's dance, then play the "Dedication to West" while you are resting in the middle Ervia, I will be able to..." Natasha smiled and blinked at Lucien. There is no New Year concert in the Principality, but there is the "Aalto Music Festival". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands her very tacitly, that is to find an excuse to send himself to a manor, but actually Lu Xien prefers to be like "vigilance" The reward of the long sword: ""Dedicated to Silvia" should be a private work, there is no need to play at the New Year's dance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is the road Sean your work, it is best to find a chance to publish it, the New Year's dance is a good occasion." Sylvia is speaking, the voice is slightly lower, but more to set off a slight hoarseness, "and "to the west The name of Ervia is not appropriate, others will think that you are pursuing me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and stopped: "Why not? Some unmarried musicians are pursuing you, huh, many are married, but after the Philippine banquet, their disgusting guys have completely disappeared. Well, Lucien, we are discussing before. Poetry and legends from all over the Principality, you are an 'expert' in this area, I hope you give 'guidance . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Experts "De Luoni glanced at Lucien on the sofa opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien had sat on a single sofa and shook his head and said: "I just wanted to create, and I have recently read a lot of books in this area. Her Royal Highness has always been very humorous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come, even Mr. Baker thinks that Lucien has the potential to become a historian, no, you already It’s a historian.” Natasha was in a good mood, half jokingly said, “Uncle Drony is a successful businessman, a director of the Aalto Metal Jewelry Guild, who travels all the year round in the Principality and knows many poems. Legend, you must have a common topic in this regard, you can communicate well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under her leadership, four people talked happily before dinner. In this regard, Camille occasionally said a few words, it seems that when she was young, she used to travel in the Principality as an adventurer and a mercenary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, it’s almost dinner time, Dronie smiled thoughtfully: “I thought that my Royal Highness was a joke, but after the exchange, I found Lucien, you are really a historian who can accurately judge the age and background of poetry and legends. I happen to know a folk poem that is rarely circulated, and I have been curious about what it describes. When is the place in the Principality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
