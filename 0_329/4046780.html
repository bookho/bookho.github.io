			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worship the demon event?" When Anna asked this sentence, she was very curious, except for the veritable killer and always eager The metamorphosis of blood, I am afraid that only the real madman will worship the chaotic demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no desire to believe in the Duke of the Devil, at least they have to be "in good faith" countless times, so it is not surprising that one or two guys alone worship the devil, then It’s quite strange that many people die at the scene. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina also believes that the Magic Council issued this mandatory task because of the words "worship the demon event" and changed the faith. The devil has died in the sacrifices, and the council may not investigate the matter in such detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few powerful demons trying to develop their own churches. They may have considered this issue, but they were quickly confused by their own confusion. The effects of killing and blood have left similar ideas behind the scenes. Therefore, such a large-scale worship of the demon event itself is an inexplicable and inexplicable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bar owner Gulff took a clean fur and carefully rubbed the cup in front of him, seemingly not letting go of any cockroaches, he laughed Dao: "It is indeed a worship of the demon, at least the church has undergone a detailed investigation, and the published conclusion is 'worship of the devil'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church may not be in order to It caused panic and deliberately concealed the real situation. Is this not a precedent?” Anna’s answer to Gulff’s answer was quite dissatisfied. She also became a mercenary for three or four years. She has seen and experienced many things. There have been several incidents in which the church deliberately concealed the truth for some reason, and the conclusions of their investigations have not been accepted without any doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gulf as a mercenary for more than a decade, the owner of the pub for seven or eight years, is willing to believe that the conclusion of the investigation must be confirmed by his own secret channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf saw the two girls as green as the eyes of the lake looking at themselves, tapping the table gently: "This is the information to charge, but... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he looked at the mercenaries who were looking at the door and rushing into the door, and smirked: "But the two ladies seem to let me pub The business has gotten better, so I tell you for free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann turned back and smiled and said: "Not because of Katrina's sister, I often drink here with Uncle, and I haven't seen a 'wild wolf' on a large group of wildernesses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it turns out that you are Katrina. This is a common female name in Calcutt. Are you also a local?” Gulf smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina has not answered yet, Anna said first: "No, Katrina is a nobleman from other provinces."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aristocratic family is born? No wonder there is such a temperament, which is very rare in the mercenary." Gulf thoughtfully said, "In fact, I always think Katrina you are a bit I am familiar with you, I seem to have seen you there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina’s face is slightly dimmed, and his family has been here for two or three hundred years. The self-inheriting blood itself must have inherited some of the ancestors' faces, and secretly thought: "When the parliament controls the Shahran Empire, it is convenient to wait for telecoms and discussions. When I become a high-level magician, I Will build the magic tower here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Gulff, you are familiar with every beautiful lady, tell me the information!" Anna bluntly pointed out the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf put down his fur, licked his forehead and whispered: "The first thing I found out was the servant of the villa, his name is Ivan. When I went to the cleaning hall, I saw that the hall was full of blood and corpses. There were general nobles, knights, ordinary people, artists, and magicians..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the existence of St. Ivan, the most common name of the Shahran Empire is Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorcerer?" Anna couldn’t help but exclaimed, and it was very difficult to meet the official magician in the Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, according to Ivan's description, I confirmed that the badge worn by the magician is a first-class arcade badge, a second-ring magic badge, and depending on his appearance, I found someone to inquire, and he came to Karl. Not long after the Carter City, the materials that went to the forest, the underground search and the acquisition were all that the magician needed.” Gulf briefly talked about the magician’s appearance, especially mentioning the black scorpion next to his left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina nodded in her heart and was indeed the magician who died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf continued: "This is about three or forty people of different identities who died in the same hall. It is a strange event. What is even more strange is that There is also an altar in the center of the hall. Although there is nothing on the altar, it is filled with the chaotic taste of killing and destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did these people die? , suicide, or homicide?" Katrina carefully asked questions that were in line with her current status. A slightly curious and experienced female surname should be asked by the mercenary. From Anna’s expression, She also wants to ask this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf’s voice is pressed lower: “This is the third strange place, these people are killed and killed, and not single-on-one, It belongs to a chaotic group of killings, and some dead people have fatal wounds around them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A magician will be killed by ordinary people and artists. "Don't say Katrina, even Anna feels unacceptable. "Is there a knight in the audience?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a knight, but he was also killed. When it comes to this matter, Gulf’s face can’t help but show a trace of fear. “There is no trace of blood power in the Cavaliers, and there are no fluctuations and phenomena of magical residuals. It shows that they were the identity of ordinary people. 'Expanded 'killing feast', and, from the corpse backwards and position, no one tried to escape..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than the Magic Council to Catri Na’s intelligence is much more detailed, she said: “Is it the magic illusion? I heard that there is When the cult is worshipping, the altar will send out the illusion power that affects the mind of the human being, so that the believer can make all kinds of incredible things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely, the noble lady, I have more information about me than I do, and I know more about cults than I do." Gulf put away the expression of fear and smiled happily. "There is this possibility, so it is said that it is a demon event, at least the devil will not let Their own believers kill each other and let them die in more valuable places, while other cults are closer to the devil's practice. Even if they want to use pure killing power to kill, they will not choose their own believers. Of course, I don't. Knowing how the church determines that the deceased are all demon believers, maybe they are just 'ordinary people'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds weird, more than a bard story It’s terrible.” Anna patted her chest. “Uncle Gulff, what other weird place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Weird?” Gulf I recalled it carefully, "The expressions after their death are all It’s not like killing death, but getting rid of death, but getting rid of it, right, Ivan felt cold when he entered the hall, but it was still warm at the end of May.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna's curiosity was motivated to the greatest extent, constantly asking about this, but Gulf knew only so much, could not help but sigh: "There may be more on the scene. There are many signs of surprise, but Ivan was scared and could not notice much. After the church investigation, I was worried that the demonic atmosphere would affect the city of Calcutt and clean the villa with the light, so even if there is, we will never know. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church cleaned the villa with the light..." Katrina repeated it in a low voice, which was a great problem for her own investigation. It shows that it is very difficult to find valuable traces on the scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she curiously asked: "Is Ivan later recalling what?" This has been going on for months. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yeah. "Anna nodded, and a "story" broke in the middle and always let her worry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf mouth pumped, trying to squeeze out a wretched smile, But how can this smile look like fear and fear: "Ivan has witnessed the scene of killing bloody, doing nightmares every day, and the church has given him a lot of rewards, so he often comes to me to drink, only drunk. If he can't remember anything, he can sleep peacefully. However, one week after the incident, he was drunk and accidentally fell into the tributary of the Negening River that passed through the city and drowned inside. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
