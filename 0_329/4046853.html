			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Annick was slightly calmed down, listening to the faint cheers from all directions, and quickly transferred the magic radio to the "World Reality" channel. Because he believes that this audience is sure to have more detailed reports on the channel of the Arcanists, such as the teacher based on what principles and data to correct the position of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they didn’t ask their teacher Lu Xi’an directly because they returned to Allinge from the “Cosmic Observatory”, they tried to contact them for the first time. He reported that Heidi had discovered new particles, but the housekeeper Leo told them that the teacher had closed the top magic tower and it would take a long time to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...According to the report submitted by Lord Evans, he found strange distortions of the light and hidden secrets in space during the following experiments, and then based on this situation Corrected the standard coordinates of the Sun's universe..." "Larks" Samantha really expected the same as Lun's "discovery report" in detail, and gave a complete description of the whole process. High-level magicians can imitate this experiment, so that the middle and low-level magicians can understand where the theoretical basis for correcting the sun coordinates is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report makes every arcane master heard no doubt, Lord Evans did discover the sun and found the sun with reason Otherwise, his report will not be written so detailed that one can imitate reproduction - reproducibility and reproducibility are the hallmarks of arcane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good, complicated experiment." Although the various particle collision experiment designs and artificial intelligence improvements carried out by themselves are quite complicated, Heidi still I couldn't help but feel a bit stunned because it was too complicated and complicated to be designed by an abnormal arcian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Split, who has always been confident and awkward, has to whisper: "I am afraid that only teachers can design such complex and effective experiments..." I can't do it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a fundamental disagreement with Lucian in the observer effect, Annick is very admired for his own teacher, he is a new field of development It is the proponent of subversive theories, the main creator of the development of arcane research and the magical society in the past decade, and he is still far away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the entire parliament has no more than ten such whimsy and deep arcane foundations, but I still feel too complicated, maybe the teacher still Relying on a little luck, perhaps his initial thought was to conduct other experiments..." He hesitated to say his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This judgment did not cause dissatisfaction with Heidi, Katrina, etc., because they have a good understanding of arcane and magic research for a long time, and some find it true Need a bit of luck. For example, in the "Cosmic Observatory", the experiments designed by everyone are all the same, but in the end, Heidi has found a lot of new particles, because she designed a little leak... Of course, Basically, only the long-term experimental and deep-based arcane masters can grasp the "Gift of Goddess of God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, the sun has finally been discovered! The history of magic has opened a new chapter!" Heidi's eyes clenched his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arion’s Magic Tower, 31st floor, all “sky The radio station's arcane masters are excited to listen to Samantha's broadcasts - Louise is the news for the general public, there is no knowledge they need to pay attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlike the past, this time, Samantha, who mourns the report in his hand, is no longer a cold and faint look, but a smile on his face. I can't restrain myself from the good emotions, and the arcane masters who used to get used to her style are quite amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, the gradual resurgence of determinism has made most of the arcade arcanes feel painful, but they have to slowly change their mindset, so performance It was quite melancholy, and many of the Rantat poets praised them as an arcane master who studied the vast stars and had a perfect poet temperament, but the discovery of the sun ignited their long-lost passion and burned melancholy and pain. At least during this time, they are delighted from the heart and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery that has plagued the stars for ten thousand years is finally solved today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the last word, smiling and putting down the manuscript in his hand, Samantha indicated that the next show host started, and he left the seat and went to Outside the room, I took a deep breath of cold and refreshing air at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha looked up at the cold and dreamy silver moon in the sky, and there was a little joy in her tone: "If it weren't for him, this great arcian, I am afraid no one can design such a complicated and unimaginable experiment. This may be lucky. The goddess' favor is her recognition of the obsessive pursuit of the celestial phase, so that he has such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no name, but around The surgeon knows that she is talking about "Atoms control" Lord Evans, and she originally wanted to say not the Arcanist, but his "Arcane Monster". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the nicknames of Lucy for many Arcanists, because any achievement he has is the vast majority of the Arcans I can't finish one, but he asks one at a time. This is not an "Arcane Monster". What is an "Arcane Monster"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, they have no doubts about why Lucien can design this complex anomaly experiment because he is synonymous with miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After today, our astrology is no longer a non-rooted magical faction..." Another astrology arcane master said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Arcane Arcane Master, it is not because the planet is real, it is material, and it doubts the basis of its prophecy. After all, "destiny starry sky" It is indeed "where". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha nodded slightly: "The next step in our research is two directions. One is to study black holes, stars, galaxies, etc., to unlock the real universe. One of the mysteries, looking for its origins and predictions of its development, the other is to explore the connection between the real universe and the destiny of the stars, to understand why the operation of the stars will affect the destiny of the stars."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." In addition, the other Arcane Arcane division's eyes seemed to have a burning flame, and decided to solve the problem and did not let the star system die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha still looked at the silvery moon outside the window, whispering in his heart: "In fact, the church woven the background for him, it is an angel, but also a devil... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Destruction Theater", Oliver did not listen to the radio, and I read it repeatedly with the report submitted by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the gold-rimmed glasses and frowned slightly: "This experiment is too complicated, not like it was designed, but it seems to know the result. Is the product of the process a reverse engineering of Lucien?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great arcade master who has studied the universe and explored many stars, he At first glance, I found out that it was wrong, but the reason was attributed to the reason that Lucien studied the other, and unexpectedly got the feedback of the spell model, and then proceeded from this spell model and reverse engineered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Thunder Hell", Fernando threw the report in his hand on the table, slightly roaring: "This kid must have discovered it first." This experiment designed by the sun, don't fool me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his understanding of Lucien, he has good reason to believe that Lucien It must be the position of the sun based on other harvests, and may have complete theoretical support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dropping the report, Fernando saw that the pages on the back of the report had text different from the previous format, so I picked it up again and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Requires verification to be published?" Fernando repeated in a low voice. These pages are a complete record of the conversation between Lucian and Douglas. He only went to Fernando. Hathaway's two trusted arcanists offer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando has been pondering for a long time, trying to unravel the mystery contained in Lucien’s words, but ultimately there is not enough progress due to insufficient information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of record is this thing, come and communicate directly!" Fernando snorted "irritated" and inspired electromagnetic communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the current sound of Zizz, Fernando heard the voice of Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien went to the dark mountains?" Fernando repeated Natasha’s words and then sighed, "This kid is running very fast." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
