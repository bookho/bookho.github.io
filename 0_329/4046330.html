			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze blowing from the stormy straits dispelled the dryness of the city of Aringe, and it was exceptionally refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly stood in the window of his garden villa study, watching the blossoming flowers wash away the dust, the delicate and tender, the heart kept thinking about yesterday Awkward things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sudden development of the soul potential, the need to consolidate the foundation, plus the suspicion of a certain lord and the dangers of Aalto, Lucien did not waste time Aalto stayed, waiting for himself and Natasha's oysters to leave in the past, but eagerly took Leo to start the special and precious magic scroll back to the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This delivery is a test and help for a certain person?" Yesterday, in a manor outside Aalto, a black knight’s suit Tasha didn’t have much surprise when she heard Lucien’s description. She smiled and nodded. “This is similar to my guess. For Lucien, you have such an amazing and talented guy, the Magic Council even internal battles. It’s going to be awesome, and you won’t be able to arrange for you to perform such a high-risk task. Oh, don’t know who your teacher will be?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na Tasha doesn't think that Lusien will refuse. Since this lord made a similar move, it means that he has privately "communicated" with other big people who intend to accept Xi'an as a disciple. Otherwise, it is not a waste of human feelings, and His "test" is not cold, malicious, and torturous. On the contrary, he is very thoughtful. Considering the various dangers and the ability of Lucien to take advantage of his own understanding of Lucien's surname, he can judge that he does not contradict, and not In the case of conflict, become legendary Son, the temptation can not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled helplessly: "I don't know, I haven't had any contact with these big men. I have to go into the semi-plane, or go back. After the Magic Council, I realized that I hope that I am a teacher who is good at the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is very happy and happy with Lucien who is about to become a legendary disciple. Beautiful: "It won't be Hathaway's mother-in-law anyway. I can't make a similar arrangement with her surname. Lucien, you don't have to worry, the legendary magicians of the Magic Council are not terrible, or remove the dark mountains, hell, In addition to the legendary powerhouses such as the abyss, most of the legendary powerhouses are not terrible in the absence of positional conflicts. Most of them have their own areas of focus, as long as their guidance can keep up with them, they will not be blamed. And I believe in your talent in arcane and magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also a disciple of the epic knight - the head of the Knights of the Holy Sword The brilliance" Beria, compared to this matter . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Natasha’s expression became slightly solemn: “After you become a legendary magician, plus the reputation of the Holm Crown Award, you will definitely Being valued by the church, although not qualified enough to enter the purification sequence, I believe that the cardinals and cardinals in each parish will get information about you, so John and their family should urge them to 'act'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am about to come out this time for this matter. Natasha, please, please." Lucien put away a smile, serious and dignified, thought it would be at least several Years, even ten years, when you win another magical parliament award or make something earth-shattering, this thing will enhance the journey, but in a few days, there have been such big changes. If it is not arranged early, things will become very tricky and troublesome, and a little carelessness is a painful ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s right index finger and thumb rubbed his chin, revealing a smile: “Reassured, I will arrange it. However, Lucien you can’t continue now. Staying in Aalto, so as not to be insane in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she freely and farewell to Lucy, returning to the city of Aalto, and Lucy En deeply glanced at her back and took Leo, who was waiting outside the manor, and started the precious magic scroll with heartache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of spatial transition jumps makes Lucien’s soul and brain more chaotic, like where it penetrates, as if there is a structural change around it. If it is not the protection of the magic scroll, it has long been lost or broken in the "space." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the principle of space movement or jumping here?" After arriving at a half-face of a whirlwind and lightning thunder, Lucien was a little awake. The subconscious mind thinks about the magic that is currently incomprehensible, but the waking does not last long, and the power of the magic scroll continues to "shuttle" and "jump" with Lucien until it appears on a hill near the city of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drizzle outside the window gradually filled with a mist, which was rarely seen in the June season. Only the city of Aringe was in a strange position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the rare scenery, Lucien recalled all the scenes of the past, and sighed softly: "I don't know how Uncle Joel and John will be treated." The torment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After worrying that the emotions slowly subsided, Lucien raised a few troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial clumsiness, after the subconscious resistance, has always been more rational, not self-deception, Lucien after a period of mood precipitation and experience in the dream of dangerous dreams finally I have confirmed my own intentions. I really have a good impression on Natasha. I don’t know when it will accumulate and then suddenly burst out. Perhaps her surname is more appreciated by herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how can I catch up with her?" Confirmed the mind, and Lucine, a member of the "Planned Action Party," immediately began to calmly analyze difficulties and obstruct In order to facilitate the preparation of a package of pursuing girls after reference to the miscellaneous books in the Soul Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a knight who believes in the god of truth. I am a magician who specializes in arcane. There is a fundamental conflict in position, but because of her mother's identity and Love story, in this respect, her attitude is relatively soft, as long as perseverance, moisturizing and instilling and changing, there is no small hope for success, but I can not give up my magic path for feelings, return to Aalto settle, to Her surname and knighthood are not likely to give up the Grand Duke for me and give up the Principality. This is the biggest difficulty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She likes female surname, but not Determine if you still like the male surname, you can only slowly test and deepen your feelings. This is the second biggest difficulty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she still likes the male surname, What type would you like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should the girl of this family name start with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;...... As a rookie with no emotional experience, Lucien flaunted himself as a calm analysis, but he wanted to , Grew more and more distant, even thought the difficulties after the marriage, the more that hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, knocking on the door awakened the daze of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leo, what?" Lucien felt out that he was his new steward, Leo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo turned the handle and opened the door, respectfully said: "Master, the element will please you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the show finally going to start? Lucien calmed down and picked up the black top hat on the coat rack and ordered, "Leo, prepare me a carriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at Leo and turning away, Lucien silently made a fist and concluded the previous analysis: "The temporary plan is to turn one communication per month into two!" Even if you want to swear, you can give up without trying. Not my own name, as for more plans, I can't think of it now, I can only improve my magic and arcane level first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the middle of the night, outside the Vaolirit referee, an obese figure walked to the neighborhood with a faint sneak peek. There are things in your heart that are fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice, do you want to sell small Evans?" A cold, angry voice came from behind her, scaring her to turn and see The face is iron and green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza shuddered, feared and resolutely refuted: "Is this not a small Evans suggestion?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But can you stand the inner trial?" Joel snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s voice suddenly became high, with pain and crying voice: “What if you don’t do this? Wait for Little John and Little Evan to Firearms? We are not too young, and enjoy the luxury life of these years, even if it is burned to death, there is a relationship, at most, it is hell, but they are still so young, the future is so bright!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you hear about it? Little John is a genuine knight, a knight of the Violet family. The referee will definitely check it carefully, know the magician, and be deceived by the magician. It’s not a crime that needs to be on fire! Isn’t you thinking that he secretly cooperated with Little Evans about something sacred?” Joel felt the pain of Alisa, the tone eased, hugged her, and stroked her. Back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
