			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge, the magic tower of the Parliament Headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The always energetic Rachel turned the magic robe into a dark color to show his mood, heavy depression, and nervous waiting. Yesterday, I have not heard the submission of the papers of Mr. Brooke and Mr. Roland. Will they pass the review before the publication of the "Arcane" journal? What is the result of the experiment? Did you deny the light quantum hypothesis of Lucien? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the influence of his friend Samantha, Rachel’s cognitive world has changed a lot in the past three years, and he cannot be said to be a firm wave of supporters. Even the light quantum hypothesis, which is more inclined to accurately predict the experimental phenomena of various photoelectric effects, can be influenced by the apprentices. The classic double-slit interference images and Brooke bright spots remind her that light has obvious volatility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really like Lusien said, should we look at the problem of waves and particles from a higher level and perspective?" Some confused buds Chel took back his right foot before stepping on the lift and turned to the exchange area. Although he waited for half an hour at the teacher Isabella, he should be able to see the latest issue of "Arcane", but she urgently I want to know the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace was slightly accelerated. When approaching the redemption area, Rachel found that the front was crowded with people, and could not help but sigh: "The wave-particle debate has received widespread attention. Usually, "Arcane" is released, how many magicians come to buy? How many of the arcane masters below the high level can fully understand each of the above papers in "Arcane"?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking in this way, does not prevent her from squeezing to a little less exchange desk, but the layers of people are not heard at this time, showing unspeakable repression and despair . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" This made Rachel full of curiosity, so he turned his direction and relied on a few four-five magical aids without attacking the surname. , squeezed into the front of the encircled exchange table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah...the short-lived screams only came out halfway, and the broken head, the brain and blood of the ground, grabbed a The body of the "Arcane" was spread into Rachel's pupil in a horrifying way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not a few people around the Arcane Master who have killed themselves, but suddenly someone falls in front of them in this way, still a little unbearable, after all, the cognitive world They are familiar with the heads, but in fact they have not seen many examples in the past 100 years. In addition to the elemental will and the pale hand, the middle and high-level magicians have witnessed once, others have never seen them, pastors, bishops. The scene of becoming a torch and fireworks is occasionally met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level magicians and apprentices who have not yet accepted the forced missions are even more shocked and scared. Words such as Sean Evans and Broken Skull, as if they were the demon masters who would pinch their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Soul Chicken Soup" column is very popular with magicians, but few people find teachers and my illusionists for psychological counseling and crisis intervention. It seems that the situation will change a lot..." Rachel was extremely depressed, but his thinking was quite derailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the main reason for suppressing the atmosphere of despair is not the horror of the picture, but the "Arcane" spread out, written in bold black font A few lines of words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Although I did the experiment to negate the quantum hypothesis of light, the experimental results and images perfectly matched the characteristics of the photon. I have to admit that my 'negative attempt' has initially proved the quantum theory of light..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Edwin Brooke, Archer, legend Professional 'master of the four levels'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel raised his head slightly, looking at the silver ceiling of the hall at a 45-degree angle, as quiet as the surrounding "From the day I entered the Magic School, I never thought about the volatility saying that there would be such a day. Shouldn't it be like this magic tower, like the theoretical system of Lord Douglas and Lord Brooke?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world seems to be no I know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel’s rare sentimentality, and then sneak out of the crowd in a strange sad mood, and suddenly return to the Hall of Magic, then Stepping on the lift, arriving at the Arcane Audit Committee, and ringing the door of the teacher Isabella's office, as if looking for a child with a warm and consoling "mother". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Isabella's answer, Rachel suddenly woke up, how did he come here? Isn't it normal to wait for the "brain wave and hormone center" next to the "Atom Research Institute" to wait for the teacher? Shouldn't the teacher start at 9:00 from the Magic Tower? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently push open the half-covered door, Rachel saw the teacher’s magic robe turned into a black dress, wearing a white flower on his chest, suddenly Asked with horror: "Who passed away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, Collester..." Isabella’s face was a little sad and said a few first name. She is not a high-ranking magician who has only recently been promoted, and she has more or less friendship with those stubborn old masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ruo, Master Roland?" Rachel’s mind showed the image of the stubborn old man, but the most impressive thing was his chest. A row of badges, that is a dazzling aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella gently decapitated, with a glimmer of light in his eyes: "Yes, a great mage has fallen, one has gained electromagnetic, light dark The Archmage, who has the highest honor in the field of heat, has fallen, and has been eliminated by the development of Arcane and Magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Rachel suddenly felt this The world is so bleak and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella didn’t have much emotional “laughing” and comforted: “Don’t despair, don’t be confused, this is normal. It reminds me of it. When I was young, I saw the particle theory supporters bursting their heads at regular intervals, so now there are so few support for particle theory. You should be glad that this time there are three years of cushioning and paving. Therefore, the three light and dark field members who reviewed Dr. Brooke and Roland's thesis did not die, but the soul was traumatized and it took several months to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well." Rachel saw this history from the history of magic. It was the era when Brooke’s brilliant talents subverted the particle theory of light. He climbed the big arcanes with his broken skull and brain blood. The throne became the second legendary peak of the parliament. It was even said that there was a friend of the Douglas Speaker. The members of the highest scoring group and the legendary magician were destroyed together with his half-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, reading this history from a book is one thing, and personally understanding the "reproduction of this history" is another matter, so shocking. The picture is completely untenable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella saw that Rachel’s face was still pale, so she went to her and stroked her hair, and the mother comforted her: “This It will also be an age of growth. In the decades when Dr. Brooke brought change, the Parliament added Lord Helen, the two great Arcanists of Vicente, and four other legendary magicians, so that the strength of the parliament’s top ranks It has doubled, and after nearly a hundred years of development, the Master and the High-level Magician have become far more numerous than before. I remember that when I was a child, the Parliament was probably more than 20 Masters, and now there are 62... Six "11."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our opportunity, we must remember, we must not blindly adhere to it, nor can we easily shake it, everything is based on facts." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Light Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, 'Destroy Lightning', the purification sequence of the 76th." The referee giant Baha'u'llah smiled and read: "Cores Tel, 'Bloody Thunder', the 259th purification sequence... I really want to give Lucien Evans the professor the "Night Angel" medal in recognition of his removal from the evil wizard The outstanding contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holm Kingdom, he also learned the standard language of the Crown Award to laugh at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knight Shidong laughed: "A Master, three high-level magicians, twenty-seven mid-level magicians, and more. Cognitive world broken coagulation, if Lucien Evans is willing to be a night watchman, with this merit, his ranking among the night watchers will be in the top five!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three legendary powerhouses of the Inquisition, one of whom is the ancient magician attached, so it also entered the rank of the night watchman. Since he once killed the legend of the top 30 of the purification sequence, there is no doubt The ground is ranked first. Although there are many high-level players in the night watchman team, there are no more than ten in the nine-ring level. It is even rarer to purify Roland, a high-ranking nine-level arcian and nine-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
