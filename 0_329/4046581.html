			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the interview, Lowell and others walked out of the conference room with eccentric expressions. They had prepared various atomic domain knowledge and various techniques of the magical array. None of them came in handy. Mr. Evans’s topic is really weird and unimaginable. Especially in the planning of life, this still needs to be answered. It is not the level of arcane and magic from one to two, from two to three, and so on. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such a simple answer is obviously not satisfactory to Mr. Evans, so each interviewer adds more or less the part he understands, such as Ophelia's plans for her own knowledge system and areas of expertise, such as Black's arrangements for how to return to Allinge from the Sorals, have also placed many people in the Atomic Institute into their own life plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the scenes that have just introduced my strengths and weaknesses, Lowell’s face is thought of when it’s inexplicable in his life plan plus the search for a like-minded partner. Hot, I dare not look at the neighbors, afraid to find the ridicule in their eyes, in his heart, this is a shameful interview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, other people are similar to him. I just don’t know how many interviewers are impulsive. I also talked about how miserable past I used to introduce myself. I thought that I could exchange sympathy and compassion. When the interview was over, I only had the feeling of burning hot and hot on my face. I wanted to take off my clothes and cover my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock smiled quite brilliantly: "You are waiting here for ten minutes, and Lucien will make a choice soon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of interview is very happy, especially when the interviewer expresses himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Rock’s words, the shame of Lowell and others disappeared, leaving only tension and expectation. As Rock enters the conference room, the door closes, their heartbeat is getting faster and faster, and the sound is getting louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, Lowell feels that he has to say something, or else he is likely to be nervous, he opened his mouth: "Erica, you said who Mr. Evans will pick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loyle was shocked when he spoke, he never thought about himself The voice can be so hoarse, so dry, just like someone else is talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elika’s nose is slightly twitching, and the voice is very low: “Today, what is said is superfluous, the ability of the show is displayed.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Black’s heart is nervous, but it’s also a person who has been promoted to the official magician in such a harsh environment as the archipelago. The surface is still calm and the smile is a bit stiff. For Ophelia, "I think you are very hopeful and perform very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia smiled and said: "Don't say this. I will not be able to put more hope into it, and the greater the hope, the more disappointment will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said plainly, can be two I don’t know when I’m already clenched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a suffocating atmosphere, the door slammed open, and they looked up at the same time, looking forward and looking very nervously at Evans. Mr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "You are all very good and full of potential. Unfortunately, the Atomic Research Institute only needs ten assistants. I have to make quite a Difficult choices, try to choose those who are closer to the needs, the first person, Mr. Barzagli."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loy's teacher at school, the middle-aged The man waved a few fists in excitement, but after all, he was a second-ring magician, and he barely kept his demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second person, Ophelia." Lucian Qingyin's gentle voice was introduced into Ophelia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reacted to her head and looked at Lucien, and then she saw Lucien smile at her and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, she realized that she was picked up by the Atomic Research Institute, and a blue mist suddenly appeared in the blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of success, without any money and materials to bribe, nor to exchange their own flesh and feelings, all rely on their own magic and arcane ability It’s just right! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to Mr. Evans's announcement of the candidates one by one, I heard the cheers and cheers around, and Lovi was getting more and more nervous. The subconsciously held his breath. Mr. Black was selected. Elika was selected. The two people I met before. Apprentices have also been selected, but why have they not been themselves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tenth person chooses, Lovi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lowell feels that there are countless stars in front of him Appearing, almost the legs fell to the ground, strong joy and excitement like a volcanic eruption, making your mind swell and your eyes moist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't faint, if you are too bad, I will consider returning." Lucien said cold humor that others don't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listening to Lowell, this is as beautiful as the elf song, busy saying: "No, no, Mr. Evans, I am in good health. "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in his sight seems to suddenly become cute and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After telling Jerome to arrange the ten assistants, Lucien went to the Panel to see the progress of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have already confessed that two are spies of the Southern Church, one is related to the Northern Church, one is tempted by the intelligence of the Holy Hertz Empire, they are all Promises, as long as they can be mixed into the atomic research institute, they will be rewarded with great rewards. Each time they provide a piece of information about the institute or yours, they will get the corresponding rewards." Tom handed the interrogation information to Lucien, doubtful. "The Holy Heilz Empire cares about what you do, isn't it always dominated by the church to deal with the magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien screamed, he was different The space has destroyed the plan of Rudolf II, and it is obviously related to the silver moon. How can he not pay attention to himself? Of course, this kind of thing is inconvenient for the soup, which is the secret of the highest level of the jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over the interrogation data, Lucien’s gaze suddenly solidified, and Isaac’s image of the vigil who bought him was so familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minsk... Juliana..." Lucien whispered the names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Rhine projection into the clown dream, Lucien knew that Amorton had problems and knew several night watchers who were mixed with the clown. Who is it, what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was originally no problem, because Lucien had already met the Knight of the Knights, and it was normal for them to follow Amorton, but according to Isaac The two night watchers took turns to meet him three years ago and always hope that he can get along with him. That is to say, at least three years before Sald became the cardinal of Holm parish, he has already arranged this. Something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder he had to hide Natasha and me from the beginning, but the plan is so far-reaching, he is so sure that he can adjust it?" Lucien Doubt, then to the soup, "Look for the opportunity to affix these two night watchers, do not rush to remove, do long-term monitoring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Master of the Master Division secretly protects the family of John Natasha, the deputy head of the Knights of the Small Knights, not to let them know, nor to conflict with the intelligence personnel arranged by Natasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The two night watchers are full of hatred for themselves, and Lucien is worried about when they are out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The soup is more and more polite to Lucien, not to mention the status change brought by his "new alchemy", just his magic The improvement in strength makes people seem to see the next legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 30, experienced a conservative assassination of Nata Queen Sarah naturally undoubtedly came to the Royal Tower of Holm and announced that she would have dinner with the elders here to celebrate her oysters and return to Nexel Palace the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the Duke of James and the Duke of Russell were also assassinated at the time, they must be angry, and the conservative aristocrats did not object to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting darker, Natasha, who is celebrating the oysters with the royal family members in the Holm Royal Towers banquet hall, excuses to see Hathaway leave. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
