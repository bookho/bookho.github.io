			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind blew, the cold sweat on his forehead almost frozen into ice, the cold Downey trembled, but even so, he still did not wake up, still looks like Looking at his right hand with a fear, he recalled the picture just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tedious black and white gray seems to affect the solidification of the surrounding, completely restraining the evil spirits, and can directly penetrate the evil spirits defense spells, The right hand is so strange, so powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to the black body armor that you encountered in your nightmare, and it is exactly the same as the black and white gray that is sealed in the center of the "Cosmic Star"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a scorpion in the nightmare that I was infected by the "monster" without any awareness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that you can manipulate yourself and other people’s dreams, looking at it is like looking at the purest and most essential death monster, Downey’s fear from the depths of his soul And fear, so he shook his head violently, awake from the shackles, screaming insanely, fast, go to Karl, only he and the big man behind him can help me solve this problem! They should be very interested in this monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner cry drives Donnie’s step and walks toward the real old castle gate, when he sees a little shimmering powder Above the carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil dust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie slammed down, this is what was left after the death of the evil spirits? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evil Dust" is a rare and intermediate material than "Writing Dust", which is the harvest that Donnie never dreamed of! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Downey stayed in the same place, did not lean over, did not cast spells, and there was a clear and obvious voice in his heart:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil spirits of the past should have the strength of the five-ring mage, maybe close to the high-order, to kill me is like killing an ordinary person, but it is in that kind Under the strange black and white gray, under my right hand, I have no resistance, and I am punctuated like a bubble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...我的Is the right hand so powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is it just that the smell of the monster makes me so powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After really feeling the power of his right hand, Downey hesitated, for a civilian who worked so hard from ordinary people to magic apprentices to formal wizards, this strength is not I dare to hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With it, I can gain the strength to restrain the high-order below the dead, and maybe even higher-order can affect..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, it seems to be able to eliminate the superior ability below the high level as the 'elimination' of the blood, and may even be stronger..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, I can venture into the spirits of the world, and go to various mausoleums that are considered dangerous places to harvest all kinds of materials and get the digital wealth of the stars. I will greatly improve my strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Strength is equal to status, even if I face the big aristocracy, I will be treated with respect..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This allows fathers and mothers to stop worrying about grocery stores and enjoy the convenience and enjoyment of various alchemy items...this allows Lily went to a general school to study, so she didn't have to help her at home, waiting to marry, not having her own life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Downey's facial muscles are twisted like never before, presenting a fearful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody can see that my right hand is weird! At least Carl and the big guy behind him didn't notice!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Downey inserted his right hand into the pocket on both sides of his magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downey woke up and felt the bitter cold, the mind was clear, and all kinds of desires were suppressed by fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What happened to me just now... The monster atmosphere hidden in the right hand can make me strong, but who knows if it will infect me gradually? , turning me into a zombie without my own thoughts..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the power of uncontrollable sources must be carefully studied...how many high-level magicians in the past It’s because of rash trials...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“As long as you live, you have a chance!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Downey finally made up his mind and planned to go back to the town to call Carl. Karl gave him a private communication number. At the most serious time, he just lost his right hand, and maybe it was not so miserable. Control the power without hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the old castle, the tall and tall figure chuckled: "Fortunately, this guy is not bad for his desire to restrain, otherwise it is not only It’s an infection of death, and maybe it will also lead to the 'greed' devil.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devil, as long as there is intelligent life, it will never be It has been completely eliminated. It will reappear after more than ten or twenty years, but it is not so strong for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness shrouds the forest, Downey walks alone in this quiet dark The roar of the beasts that sounded from time to time is even more chilling, but for Downey, this is much safer than the castle. These beasts and ghosts add up to a "paralyzed breath" of evil spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left a note to the Baron Herdos, saying that he had solved the evil problem and then returned to the town without any delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blessing of the spell, two hours later, Downey saw his familiar town, with bright street lights in addition to the platform of the magic steam train. In addition, the rest of the place is dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey chose the platform and walked to the "duty room", and he rang the closed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" The staff at the station was afraid to ask, wouldn't it be a robber? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many magic steam trains that transport goods will pass at night, plus long-distance trains, the platform must be dispatched at any time, but in this town, on duty It is difficult for the staff to have the power of a magic apprentice. In the face of various dangers, they can only rely on the "burst gun". Now the robbers have learned to be savvy, know how to avoid, and no longer wait for the same as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they still have the strength of a knight attendant or a magic apprentice, it is even more dangerous. After all, the "burst gun" needs manual aiming and cannot provide mental lock. Features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie took off his magician badge and shook it in front of the window: "I am Downey, I need to borrow a wired phone from the platform, this is the magician's Rights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the joint regulations of the Magic Council and various countries, in the emergency, the official mages can borrow platforms, police stations, town halls, town offices, etc. Local communication facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff inside sighed and recognized the authenticity and opened the door: "Mr. Downey, please come in, the wired phone is on the table." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey nodded lightly, no time to thank, hurried to the table, dialed Carl's number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep, beep, toot, after three rings, Karl’s lazy voice sounded: “Who? Call me in the early hours! You don’t know this is very Is it inhuman and very cruel behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be a little angry when he wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie stunned, the Carl sound heard from the phone seemed to be less magnetic: "Karl, I am Downey, I met a very Strange things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donnie? What a strange thing?" Carl felt awake, then habitually said, "If not strange, you I have to apologize to me, disturbing the sleep and dreams of others is a crime to go to prison. I have to keep my spirit to listen to Victor Grandpa’s concert tomorrow. This may be his last concert. I must not miss it. Yawning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
