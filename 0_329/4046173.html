			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendees of the two churches came in and looked at them with a little suspicion in their hearts: "This gentleman, when did you arrive at this restaurant? Leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wax museum was chilled due to the explosion, there are still boats on the canal. Someone saw a fireball. Young man with black top hat and monocle, but can't see the length because of the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it comes to black hats and monocles, Oliyav immediately recalls the young man, so he lets the attendants come out and search everywhere. Lucien had a hat and glasses to cover it. The scene was very confusing at the time. The description he gave was only black and black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the two attendants of Lucien, except for the black-haired black scorpion, are not satisfied at all, so they only routinely ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"9:40." Lucian calmly replied, "I and the lady are here to discuss things, not leaving the restaurant halfway." Emphasis is on the restaurant to mislead Grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greece then replied: "I, hey, this gentleman and I have been here to discuss the art of piano performance, he has not left the restaurant." Under the association, she completely maintained Lucien, and she was sure that Lucien just went to the bathroom and did not leave the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your testimony can be trusted." The Cavaliers waited for a gentlemanly smile, then said, "Miss Grace, you have always been my favorite pianist." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple search, the two knights left the house quite awkwardly. The nobleman must have pursued Grace with an excuse to discuss music. Miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the door closing, Lucien smiled and said, "Continue to discuss the performance of the piano?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, even if it is just a formal magician, it is not difficult to kill him after consuming the Brown's magical charm, but the biggest problem and the key to the assassination is how to avoid being surrounded by the surrounding night watchman and the knight. Death or tracking arrest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let Brown "run" out of the protection ring is the best choice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no modified version of the "Charming Man" that is small in magic and easy to be covered up by others, there is no support from the Stewart Magical Parliament and most of the vigils are drawn. People, without Grace, the woman who has a status to "testify" for herself, Lucien will not try to assassinate Brown, even if she is better, her psychological quality will be stronger after more than a year, and there is no Hope, because the magicians here are not stupid, the conventional way to think of them, they can certainly think of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Grace was pleased to answer that Mr. Evans’s individual guidance was the key to his rapid fame, and he could not realize it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not anxious to guide Grace to get close to noon, and waits for lunch slowly: "Gress, you thought about it." What should I do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace is silent, before seeking for forgiveness from Mr. Evans, he is looking for a lot of hardships in life. As an excuse, although they are true, for example, the parents went bankrupt and went to court, but when they were quiet and self-satisfied, they found that vanity and greed were the main reasons. She opened her mouth and said with difficulty: "Mr. Evans, what do you want me to do? "What do I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You helped me a favor, letting my friends and Mr. Granny solve the past, about this. I am very grateful.” Lucien is sincere and sincere. “If you want to start a real music career, then take your family to Aalto. Only then, you can learn the latest music creation genre to get in touch. To one talented young man They will be your best motivation to move forward, and I will recognize your student's identity and write to you to introduce Mr. Christopher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, you?" Grace's shock was beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien waved his hand: "At least I did guide your piano performance, isn't it? And if you just want to pretend to be my student identity in Stuart If you enjoy a good life, then I will adopt an attitude that does not deny or admit it. It will neither expose you in the newspaper nor provide you with any proof and introduction."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace looked at the white cloth and was deeply silent. If he went to Aalto, it would mean that he would start a difficult struggle, because in the capital of music, even if Mr. Evans’s aura is shrouded, it is just an embellishment. . There are countless talented young musicians there, without their own creative strength and playing strength, the great musician Lu Xien? The identity of Evans students is a great pressure, such as the son of Mr. Christopher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enjoy the benefits of this aura, only study hard, practice hard, and hone creative ability. It can be expected that this will be a fulfilling but hard life, and if it is relaxed, it will be crushed by pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and staying in Stourke will undoubtedly be extravagant, gorgeous, beautiful, and enjoyable, and you can find one when you get older. The only thing missing is the real development of the music road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not urge, anyway, what choices she made, had no effect on herself, and she did not have any pity for her, just follow the equivalent exchange The principle, after all, it is actually very risky for her to pass the note for herself. The opposite is the contact of the Magic Council, Glenueff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if Grace chooses the first road, Lucien will appreciate her a little, not everyone can give up easily Enjoy and start a real effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, the waiter’s knock on the door from the lunch awakened Grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came back, her eyes circling, waiting until the waiter left, and said firmly: "Mr. Evans, I am going to Aalto, actually after the festival I Ready to stay in Aalto,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien paved the napkin and cut the steak: "I will give Mr. Christopher and my teacher, Mr. Victor. I wrote a letter." Lucien didn't worry about Grace. When she introduced her to two musicians, she immediately ran back to Stourke, so she didn't have to speak for herself. Aalto's various newspapers and comments would also Give her the worst evaluation, then basically cut off the road of music, and there is no reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chatted about the anecdotes of the Aalto Musicians Association and suddenly knocked on the door again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Gris asked after a decision, relaxed and pleasantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grace, it's us." At the beginning of the band, the silent violinist Green's voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace strangely asked: "What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" To practice in the concert hall, we are coming to see you." Piola also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished, Green’s voice became low: “Greece, don’t let the surname, since you have embarked on this impromptu road, you’re I can only go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Grace, don't escape, we have no retreat." Sharon, Piola and Leicester Attached road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they heard them, Grice smiled a little pale and smiled at Lucien, then whispered: "After meeting you the night before, I I have been very scared and very uneasy, and I have no mood to practice. I don’t think they thought I wanted to quit, no more fake. Oh, friends who have been for so many years, I did not expect that they would say this for money and status." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn't care too much to fork a steak: "Since you have made a choice, deal with it yourself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greece nodded, a little sad and a little relieved to go to the door, half open the door, facing the outside Green, Piola they said: "You rest assured, this time I I will play the piano and will not be absent, but after that, I will go to Aalto to study music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" The dumb green expression is a bit Distorted, "You are famous, earn enough money, we must draw a line with us and escape to Aalto? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although their fame is not small, but compared with Grace, it is a far cry, which makes them very regret that they did not learn the piano, gave the grid The best opportunity for Reese, watching Grace use the reputation created by her and others to get the reputation, get the status, get a lot of money, how can they not be embarrassed, how can be psychologically balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
