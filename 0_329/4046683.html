There would be no other changes, so After seeing this prosperous world, I was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando first flew in: "It seems that the world of the door", in addition to the gray hall, there are many worlds similar to the alien space, I don’t know if There is also a smart life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I tend to be different kinds of undead, just like the ones before me." Douglas observes the environment and makes rough guesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the seven headless dwarves lie down in front of Fernando and Douglas in the gray plaques that are much longer than their bodies, giving a dull voice in the belly: "Are you a prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Douglas looked at his defenses and looked at them inquiringly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prince with the head is not a good prince, the princess will scold us." The forehead of the headless dwarf said with a bulge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughs and says: "No head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No head will not worry There is no sorrow without head, no worry about appearance without head..." The gray squeaking hoarse female voice, the feeling of lifelessness around me suddenly rushed into the gap, condensed into a black gas, inside the death force Rising rapidly, it quickly reached the level of legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the gray enamel lid was opened, and a headless woman in a pure white court dress turned up and wore a string of red on her chest. An odd necklace made of apples. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look closely, you will find that each apple has a face on it, seven gray dwarf faces and a round girl face. shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give your head to me! Give your head to me!" The headless woman sighed with sorrow, and the rich death scent began to spread, destroying all the way. The sound of the soul ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernan looked at it all facelessly and suddenly said: "boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snapped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of lightning on the ground came out! The "forest" surrounded by tens of kilometers of lightning has shrouded, and the headless princess has become an ashes together with the forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No head? I seem to have seen this custom." Douglas recalled the inexplicable source of familiarity. "When I developed the Solar Islands, I met I have been to a few tribes of indigenous people. They think that the head of a person is a symbol of life. If there is a head after death, there will be a disaster. Therefore, before each burial, the head of the deceased will be cut off and burned with flames. The situation is very similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not participate in the development of the Solar Islands, listening to Douglas, slightly frowning: "Don't we dream Or is it a fantasy, so it will be transformed into something weird by something that we are familiar with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the legendary peak of the astrology system, if I even Unable to distinguish between dreams and illusions, it may only be the level of the god of truth, and this level of 'god' does not say that there is no problem, is it necessary to use this method of detour?" Douglas calm but confident Fully said, "This is the world of the dead, The phenomenon of shooting death may be its unique place, and we need to study its principles and laws."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gust of wind drifted over, and there was a hoarse voice behind her. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give your head to me! Give me your head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female Gradually, the gray ash on the ground gathered in a whirlpool, and it re-condensed into a headless figure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time it is no longer a white court dress, but wearing a white robe and holding a platinum token! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This monster..." Fernando snorted angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray wilderness filled with gravestones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is divided into two uses, while taking the Rhine to go, while analyzing the crown of the "old mummies", this legendary item seems to be the Lich King Deliberately dealt with, not as easy to crack as rough refining, Lucian estimated that at least two or three hours to have hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." The Rhine opened without warning. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lucien stopped, let go of the arm of the Rhine arm: "Mr. Rhine, have found?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein has taken a step in the hands and seems to have eliminated some of the weakness. The rehabilitative ability of the blood prince is really abnormal: "Have you noticed the patterns on these tombstones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The ancient Mesquite empire's pattern." The Mesquite Empire is one of the three ancient magic empire, occupying the area south of the Gusta Empire, its magical pattern is undoubtedly the basis of arcane One of the things, many of the Necromancer's magic needs to use something similar, so Lucien is not surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rhine leaned down and slender fingers rubbed against the quaint and mysterious pattern on the grey tombstone: "This is the early pattern of the ancient Mesquite Empire, because it differs from the middle and late It’s not big, the effect is similar, so only my observers who have studied the history can tell.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is special?” Lucien Very urgent to go to the location of the Musiglin logo, but Rhine is willing to waste precious time here, there should be reasons for him to do so, so ask in the soul connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein calmly smiled: "Looking for the legacy of Maskillin is to crack the secret of the 'world of the door', crack the secrets of monsters, and now there are The clues, naturally can not let go, we can not reverse the purpose and method. These patterns are not too special, just to show that the entire tombstone group belongs to the early Mesh Kate Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'early', in connection with the slanting tombstones everywhere, reminds me of the original famous custom of the Mesquite Empire, the 'Life Back to the Source' ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Life Return to the Source' Ceremony?" Lucien remembered the famous ritual in the history of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine elegantly took out the handkerchief and rubbed his finger: "Yes, the 'return to life' ceremony, the early Mesquite Empire generally believed that there was a strong first The intelligent creature to the extreme is the most perfect life. It has the light of the vast spiritual surname. He used his own blood to create races such as humans, elves, dragons, etc., so he disappeared into the long river of time, if he wanted to gain powerful power. This process can be reversed, blending the intelligent life of different races, infinitely close to the 'initial'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ancient Mesquite early funeral follows Such a concept is made into a giant with a wood of spiritual surname, buried in the center of the cemetery group, and each deceased only leaves clothing in his grave, and the body is filled into the interior of the wood giant in an attempt to merge with each other after death. It became close to the 'original', and although this custom gradually disappeared, many of the magic of the Necromancers have obvious traces of inheritance, such as suturing the corpse."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&&  ; Lucien recalls the necromantic magic that he knows, and gently nods: "It is true. Isn't it that someone who has ever come in on the shredded paper refers to a legendary magician of the ancient Mesquite Empire?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a certain possibility, but it is hard to imagine that such a legendary magician will arrange such a large-scale cemetery group and come in hard work. After that, in order to do this? Lu Xien, you should be very clear, the realm of the dead is the real correspondence with the main material world, but the position will become chaotic, and this law will be extended to the 'world of the door'. Can we think of this? It is the mapping of the 'world of the door' to different death customs.” Rhein dropped a soft handkerchief and opened the tomb and the lid directly. There was only one black jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "There is a logical reasoning, what does the monster represent? It is impossible to be the fear of death in the heart of every intelligent life." And I am more inclined to the mysterious existence of the dead world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to 'in the heart', Lucien suddenly has a spirit, vaguely remembered what However, it is still a little bit to see through the fog, so I frown and ponder, maybe the surface is different from the 'appearance' of the memory, so I can't find an event similar to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
