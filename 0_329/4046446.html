			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of winter, the wind is steep and chilly. There are still many flowers in the garden villa of Lucien, which are full of enthusiasm and fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put his hands in his long dress pocket, did not directly talk about the progress of the study, but asked about the promotion of several magic apprentices: "I listened to Lazar Er said, you are all very confident that you will become a formal magician. Do you think that you can purchase the 'Silver Moon' pharmacy supplement for up to a few months?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Heidi, Reyia, and Katrina looked at each other. It’s not clear whether Evans’s teacher wants to praise himself or her for improving his magical strength, or to criticize him too proudly. There is something a little uneasy, I don't know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint, who has always been full of confidence, nodded with certainty: "Our mathematical level, magical analytical ability, teaching at Evans, teaching Underneath, it is enough to compete with other formal magicians, so the advanced spiritual requirements are relatively low, and then a few months of accumulation can try to promote. Oh, this is how we communicate with several low-level magicians. The conclusion was reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling Lucian’s teaching, Sprint couldn’t help but pause, and the amount of horrible papers seemed to be horrible. Still lingering in my mind, I can't get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien leisurely stepped forward and said casually: "In the ancient magical empire, it is difficult to have a formal magic among a hundred magic apprentices. Teacher, and after the establishment of the parliament, although the arcane has developed more and more perfect, and the form of cultivation has gradually matured, it can be a high-level apprenticeship class. In the end, only three or four people can be promoted to the official mage level." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, is Evans teacher complacent about our pride? Annick and Lei Yiyah's face turned slightly red, and the subconscious wanted to apologize, while Sprint, Heidi and Katrina revealed their grievances, and they had to argue a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien waved his hand: "But you are different from them, your own talents are above the standard, and have also withstood my strict teaching, mathematical and The basic ability of magic is quite solid, oh, this is the benefit of repeated practice, and you work on the atomic research institute, which is at the forefront of the field of elemental magic. Everyday you hear, see, learn, and touch. Low-level Arcanists can only see things in the journals that they don’t necessarily understand. If under these conditions, none of you can be promoted, it must be because of your own mistakes and carelessness. Other questions, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, Evans teacher!" Heidi, Katrina, and Sprint are all smiling and confident. Answer, Annick and Reyia have eliminated their worries and uneasiness. The look has become quite exciting and confident. Originally, Evans is encouraging us! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting a magician is the first difficulty on the road to magic. Even if they are confident again, they will be able to compete with the formal magician. My heart is also inevitably left with worries and worries, especially when I saw the first two graduates of the magic school who failed in promotion and became frustrated and decadent. This sentiment became even stronger, even if Sprint The guy who is confident and arrogant is not immune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien’s words of restraint and hindrance, and a clear analysis of their superiority, let the hidden haze in their hearts disappear, no longer for promotion. There is any fear, only a strong desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the apprentices have been pumped up, Lucien feels the cold wind that has been boasted, and smiles slightly: "What research do you have recently discovered, or plan to In which direction do you study?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, the most sly Sprint answer, he was a little annoyed: “Evans teacher, let us study the phenomenon of gas discharge, In order to understand the essence of gas conduction, only the cathode ray and electrons were discovered. Lord Brooke concluded from the lightning cloud that the free electrons in the air are the cause of gas conduction, so let us not know what to study. I can only go back and continue to study cathode ray and electrons to see if I can get results in this new field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s research method is simple and rude, non- It is difficult for the great arcuist to be the leader of this legendary magician. Even if he is himself, he will be resurrected by a reserved means, so Rock, Sprint, Heidi and others can only watch it. Brooke published a paper, Was no way the first to do this experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and Spring have nodded and renewed their enthusiasm and expectations. In the past, countless facts show that when a new field opens the door, the first arcane masters have received the envy of others, and the old-fashioned and ruthless arcane masters can only be annoyed and embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, can we study cathode ray and electrons outside of low temperature experiments?" Katrina asked anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experiment of charcoal adsorption of air at a specific low temperature, she and Lei Yiya played a big role as Jerome’s main assistant. The first author of Lucine’s experimental project must be him, and the second author is undoubtedly Jerome, who is responsible for the specific experiment. Their magic apprentices have no qualifications for listing. They can only look at two. The teacher earned a lot of quoted points and the corresponding royalties - they were not official arcans at the time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in this respect, Lucien is quite atmospheric, except for the Arcane points calculated by the Parliament, which cannot be assigned to them. The patented technology for manufacturing vacuum in low-temperature charcoal is A certain percentage gave them the Arcane points, although this is not much for Lucien, a high-ranking Arcanist who has raised a dragon, but also let Katrina and Reyia quickly get enough silver. The cost of the monthly pharmacy is no shortage of materials for the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, conditional Katrina is passionate about the new atomic world, hoping to realize his dreams in this field, like Evans teacher, Isabel Ms. La got some of the highest honors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beyond the work of the Institute, what you want to do is your freedom. I also support you to have your own research direction, allowing you to borrow research from the Institute. Magic Array and Alchemy Array." Lucien expressed a positive opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, teacher Evans, I also intend to study cathode ray and electrons like Katrina." Lei Yiya cheered cheerfully, " In the last two or three months, the change in the surname of the material under low temperature conditions has no actual surname, only a little bit of data accumulation, occasionally makes people feel dull and frustrated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Research on alchemy materials has always required boring experiments and repeated data accumulation to produce fruitful results. This is the most needed foundation and the most time-consuming field. Don't think about getting huge immediately. Harvest, also don't devalue your work, well, every time the data record is very significant, maybe in the future due to material breakthroughs in the surname, can make the first-level alchemy items popular, let high-end items The price is greatly reduced, so that you get the Holm Crown Award." Lucian feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating in a circle, Lucien looked at Annick, who had been silent for a while: "What research have you been doing recently, do you want to go in the direction?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick's face is slightly red: "Evans teacher, I am also studying the issue of electronics recently, since air conduction is due to free electrons, then Is the current also related to electronics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good ideas, continue." Lucien slowed down and walked alongside Annick, the rest of the apprentices Also curious to see Annick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick is hard to get the attention of so many people, the more embarrassing, a little bit stuttering: "I want to design experiments to confirm that the knowledge of the own electromagnetic system is too It was so shallow that I couldn't find a solution. So I looked at Brook's book on Electromagnetism and his recent papers. The papers on the results of photoelectric effect experiments and theoretical contradictions gave me inspiration." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, have you found the basis for explaining this contradiction?" Lucien asked with a funny smile, he believed his own theory of quantization. This is the theory that has been deliberately forgotten by most archaeologists in the mind and indifferent. They all use the formula of heat radiation directly, instead of thinking about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick shook his head violently: "No, no, even the problem of Lord Brooke is hard to live, how do I want to get a solution, I just see part of the frequency Light illuminates the metal to produce electricity, so there is inspiration: the metal itself is not charged, but after the light is illuminated, there is a current, which excludes the possible conversion of light into the current name of the current. What exactly is the current generated?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If according to my previous conjecture, the current is related to electrons, does this mean that the illumination of the light causes the metal to generate electrons? If it can be proved, is it verified from the other side? Is electrons the internal structure of an atom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
