			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Felipe coming to the stage, the scene was quieter, and the magicians and apprentices began to whisper. The Viscount Kareldia took the wine he had tasted for a long time. He didn't know where to come from. He stood by Lucien and whispered: "Mr. Professor, I can probably guess the purpose of your death feast. But Remind you, if you want to fight, please solve it as soon as possible, otherwise I will ask you to go out. Oh, although I would like to see the two top five magicians perform a feast of magical fighting, but the premise is not threatened I myself and my castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the Viscount of Karendia with a contemptuous look, secretly: "You can know me." The purpose of this? Until now, I don’t know my purpose!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of this matter has surpassed the grasp and expectation of Lucien, let He tasted the bitter fruit of daring and decisive, and made him understand that any means, any style of acting will never have only benefits and no harm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze was blocked by the hood, and Lucien replied softly: "Maybe I just come and see? Sometimes, fighting is not the best way to solve things." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Mr. Professor, your words are full of philosophies. However, fighting is the best way to solve the enemy's body and soul." Viscount Kareldia Felipe, who looked back to the half-height wooden platform, and the four representatives who were introduced by the apprentices and the Necromancers, the old Necromancer, Sethi, the rough and pale skin, the ordinary gloomy female necromancer Tess, The smile is still the kind of young Necromancer Quentin, and the horrible Necromancer Sidney, who has sutured lines on his face and hands. They are also the only four mid-level magicians in the original Wilfried, two four-ring, two three-ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance of the magician of the ancient magical empire tradition, customary surnames obey the strong, so the representatives elected to negotiate with Felipe are naturally among them The most powerful ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go up? Mr. Professor." Viscount Kareldia said with a smile and a glass of wine on the half-height wooden platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Going to death?" Lucien continued to play with his own belly, feeling bitterly, and wrapping his behavior with seemingly deep words. "Sometimes, standing below, standing farther, you can see more things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia smiled gracefully and turned Lucien touched the cup: "No wonder your nickname is a professor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wooden stage, Sethi took his habit of stiff face expression: "Mr. Felipe, thank you for your invitation, let the magicians and apprentices who are hiding in these caves like mice have the opportunity to gather together and exchange magical knowledge and objects. This is enough for us to be called the death feast. It’s a rare opportunity to improve your strength. Don’t know what else you have to talk to us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe stares at Lucien Seeing that he didn’t plan to come up for a while, so he was loud and loud for all magicians and apprentices. Dao: "Everyone in Wilfried must have experienced a lot of hardships, such as sleeping, worrying about the church to find their identity, meditation and practice magic, always uneasy, and even be adventurous, knight, pastor Hunting into the wilderness of the mountains, watching the sun rise in the morning, but I don’t know if I can see the life that it has fallen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country controlled by the church, each The magician and the apprentice have more or less similar experiences. After listening to Felipe's words, they can't help but nod their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mr. Professor, do you think Mr. Felipe is right?" Karendia was a little surprised at Lucien’s attitude toward his jaw. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is a fact, there is no need to deny." Lucien has a broad-minded look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe continued: "You dare not tell your relatives and friends their identity, the joy of achievement is not shared, the depression in life and the failure of magic experiments The frustration of time can not find the object of catharsis and sharing. The status that you should get with your strength will never be able to get it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life It can be said that it is sad, there is no color, do you want to continue a similar life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Felipe said the pain, one The magic apprentice can't help but whisper: "Don't want, don't want it at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien didn't talk this time, just quietly watching Felipe: "If this guy tells me what I want to know, I don't have a white run."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tess, Quentin, Sidney, and Sethi all heard the meaning of Felipe, and after glance at each other, Saisi said: "Ferry Mr. Pei, if there is no way to live like this, I don’t think anyone will be willing to choose. But can we get rid of this kind of life? Can the mainland magic council help us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe's pale face finally showed a softer smile: "Yes, I am here to help everyone. In the countries where the mainland magic council is located, the magician can act in a bright and positive way, can rest assured Boldly meditate and learn magic in your own home, in the lab, without worrying about the church's door-to-door arrest. Not only that, but the kingdoms also allow the official magician to become a city council member in his city, equivalent to the status of the Lord. If you have enough The strength and prestige of being a member of the Royal Demon Court is equivalent to the House of Lords, which is a member of the House of Lords."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way?!" The description is completely beyond the imagination of the Necromancer and the apprentices. Except for Lucien, they all think that the Confucius Magic Council is a hidden organization. Although there are certainly many resources to shelter the magicians and apprentices, in essence, It is similar to the cult that sees no light, but from Felipe's words, they seem to have heard that the status of a magician is close to the "paradise" on the ground of the ancient magical empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noisy sounds, the Master and the apprentices are excitedly talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Felipe reached out and made a press to calm everyone: "More importantly, at the mainland Magic Council headquarters, as long as you With enough ability, you can get different levels of meditation, all kinds of materials, magic and objects. You can also learn arcane and magic research only by your own knowledge and not other external factors. The latest results. Ladies and gentlemen, do you want to go to the mainland Magic Council headquarters?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course.” Many magic apprentices have been quite excited to answer. The formal mages calmed down from excitement and delusion, and said in their hearts: "What does Felipe want us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So good place, so great The environment, Felipe is obviously not a good moral person to the people who are self-satisfied, then why should he be obliged to send everyone to the Magic Council headquarters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there must be requirements, and the gentlemen who can become formal magicians in the harsh living environment are not innocent and kind children, in joy At the same time, there was a little alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi as the leading necromancer, coughed: "Mr. Felipe, I can answer it for everyone, everyone wants to go to magic without a doubt." Parliament headquarters, however, I would like to ask you to understand and tell everyone, what do you need us to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe sees someone lead to this topic, nodded with satisfaction: “The church blocked the road to the headquarters of the Magic Council, so it took a certain price to bring everyone through the blockade.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped at the right time and talked about another Things: "From the ancient magical empire, there were battles and hostility between the eight factions because of their differences. Even in the fact that the faction has added several magical parliaments, there seems to be no sign of any stop." Unity and unity are the best way to survive and get a better environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am in the Arcanist 'The Dead Soul' Vicente? Milan Lord and the legendary magician 'half god lich Lord Congus has integrated the 'Pale Hand' established by the organization of the Necromancer. You are all Necromancers, and adding the 'Pale Hand' is the most appropriate and appropriate choice."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien had listened to it with anticipation, but suddenly he suddenly thought: "How do you feel a little bit of sales..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the Arcane Master, the wizards and apprentices here do not know, but the legendary magician is still very shocking. Tess, who looks ordinary, took a step forward: "If you really have a legendary magician, I am definitely willing to join the 'Pale Hand.' But after joining, what do we need to do?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if excited again, Tess, who grew up in such a harsh environment, did not forget other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
