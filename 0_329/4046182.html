			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue-black sea waves are undulating and rushing, and a sly monster with a fish head yells like a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the walkway is like a slow motion of the movie, which appears in the eyes of Lucien, the surrounding air becomes moist and filled with plenty of water. "Elements", breathing seems to start tough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices around me were scared and soft, close to the cabin, some people crying and crying, but the voice was covered by storms and thunder, although some people barely kept calm, Has shivered and his face pale. These half-children have never encountered such a terrible and dangerous situation. Just as Lucien first encountered red-eyed mice in the sewers, there was no way to stay calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless thoughts flashed in Lucine’s heart, but in this case, the priest and the knight who want to keep their lives and want to survive the ship obviously It is a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray scales of the squid fish rushed to the place where the aisle was divided, and then did not hesitate to divide into two groups, most of which followed three tall, The burly, singular fish with red scales ran towards the main cabin where the cargo was loaded, and a small part shouted and killed under the command of a strange fisherman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their purpose seems to be to rob the goods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goods are hidden inside What are the precious things that Tao fish people are interested in? So they ventured into the fleet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this is the purpose, then even if other fishermen come in, they It will also come to this level of confluence, or to the captain’s room, the cabin of the Viscount of Wright, and other places that may be hidden...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one inferred in Lucien The mind is like a meteor, and the idea is gradually forming: "Then there is no small hope to escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned and ran into his cabin The room and the feet slammed hard, and the right fist hit the iron planks on the upper deck of the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, a piece of wood flies up and falls into the cabin above, revealing a dark hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You climb up and use the switch to hide into the nearby sailor's room!" Lucien just said to the apprentices who were scared when they landed. Slightly harsh but not flustered, as if facing a dangerous situation, but a lazy student met during the guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Tom dares to arrange for himself to live here, then the upper cabin should be a reliable sailor or coolie in the room, otherwise the rest will be And the conversation is hard to get through the people above! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the purpose of the squid is not to kill but to rob, it is a good choice to take the apprentices to the poor sailor’s room, and avoid Pastors and knights who are coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pulled out the "vigilant" sword and ran outside the cabin to meet the murderous fisherman who was killed, while calmly commanding: " You want to climb up on your own, don't panic, don't rush to fight. Annick and Olmos are responsible for the arrangement, you finally go up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not rush to The fishermen who waited for themselves and others were removed, and they were very likely to break the board and chase them up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Evans." Although scared and pale, Olmos still maintained the most basic calm, and Annick has been used to it for some time. Listening to Lucien's instructions, the next meaning was a cold greeting, and then by Lucian's calm infection, no longer shivering, the brain began to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two apprentices looked at each other and said: "Use a hammock to match the wizard's hand and other magic, or use the magic to improve agility and balance..." This is the most It is easy to think of the two simplest climbing methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Olmos, Annick is busy collecting hammocks, mental talents such as Katrina, Sprint, Reyia and Heidi Outstanding apprentices are gradually waking up, either directly helping them or appeasing other apprentices around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this most dangerous moment, there is the majesty of the official magician of Lucien, who has no guilt, but has become methodical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples rushed forward like a tide, and the squid fish that were swept by it swayed and fell to the ground, screaming and screaming, even the singular fisherman with the blood of the leader’s scales The green ripples couldn't help but be confused. It seemed to be very tired and I wanted to fall asleep. The guy who crossed the sword with a long sword is not a knight but a magician? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic "sleeping". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of the Cavaliers who have not reached the Cavaliers level have no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire walkway was suddenly cleaned up, no noisy shouting, no arrogant fisherman, only the fisherman’s leader, Lucien And a large group of people who sleep anywhere, regardless of the occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fisherman’s head has subconsciously displayed his own spell-like ability “Zhan Blu-ray Ring”, with numerous waves rolling around, his eyes recovering and clear, and the surrounding “water elements” are rich. The ground is about to condense into a drop of water, so that Lucien seems to be in the depths of the sea, unable to breathe. As long as you inhale, a lot of water is poured into the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not panic, held his breath, his left hand crystal bright, three cold ice and snow flying edge emerged out of thin air, hit the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this critical moment of race against time, how can Lucien use magical items, even if the opponent seems to have only the strength of ordinary knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Fireball is not used here, it will leave a mark that is difficult to erase. Lucien will definitely use the bracelet of the Weaver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be killed in a short time, otherwise it will be easily hit by the knight and the priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The ice blade flew out, and Lussien flashed to the side, and escaped the trident thrown by the fisherman's head in time. At the same time, the chance of buffering the end of the spell was stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding rich water element is immediately isolated from an invisible filter, and only a small amount of moist gas that does not harm the lungs can pass through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic "tolerate elemental damage." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this magic does not play a big role in direct elemental magic attacks, it is a good choice for dealing with elemental imbalances, such as high temperature six Seventy degrees, such as the current "extra Blu-ray ring" in the water, so that the caster does not excessively weaken the strength because of the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice-cold temperament of "The Palmer's Ice Blade" seems to be the nemesis of the squid, and the blue waves around it are blossoming. Coagulation, instead freezing itself, unable to escape, unable to flash, hit the head, chest and arms by the flying blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue blood splashed out, the fisherman’s head with the official knight’s strength was seriously injured by the second ring magic, but its wound was slowly creeping, if not Being frozen, I am afraid it has begun to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resilience of the squid is not inferior to the troll, but it does not regenerate the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a sharp light flashed, and the head of the fisherman’s head who had not yet got rid of the freezing effect of the ice layer fell immediately. Lucien held the vigilance. "The sword appeared on its side, and this sword was on top of the wound it was caused by the ice blade." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the "sleep" effect, it loses the initiative, and a "Knight" faces the same level of magician if it loses the initiative That is the end of the rapid death, and the road it encounters is better than the equipment owned by most magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Lucien’s equipment is good, not the number and variety, such as Lucien’s shoes are ordinary items, after high-speed running It is inevitable to destroy, and there are no magic robes, magic wands and other magicians to mark surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien jumped a few steps forward and arrived behind the fishermen. When the magic was just about to be performed, the main cabin of the cargo was filled with turbulent waves like the tide of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no one in the main cabin, it can't be a magical battle. Is it something that they want to rob?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
