			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe was sitting in the room, and the things that were pushed out in front of him fell into boundless thoughts, as if experiencing a nightmare that had never happened before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly looked at his own logical deduction process, trying to find out where the problem is, and kept talking:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can an electron be a wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After over and over, his self-talk became:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can an electron be a wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt doubts conceal other ideas, he began to delve into his own papers Intrinsic meaning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is electrons a wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goose-like snow covered Outside, reflecting the faint light, emitting a cold and fiery light, Dieppe gradually put away the ugly expression like a crying smile, revealing the look of contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... According to this reasoning, it seems that all moving microscopic particles have corresponding fluctuating frequencies or wavelengths, but why is this?" Dieppe brows The wrinkle and deeper, suddenly, he recalled two sentences from this strange phenomenon, which is what Evans said in different papers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "...maybe we should look at the wave-particle problem in a more open manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Since the volatility of the light and the surname of the particle are not available Refutation, there are conclusive experimental results to confirm, then why not unify them, maybe it has a wave-particle two-like surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter sentence appears in In a simple paper, and it was said in an uncertain speculative tone, it didn't leave any impression, but Dieppe kept in mind the concept of the wave-like two-image surname. I felt touched in my heart and finally cleared my point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, as if to release a monster that would destroy the whole world, at the end of the manuscript: "We can draw such a conclusion, Wave-particle two-image surnames not only exist in photons, but also can be extended to all moving microscopic particles, including protons, neutrons, and electrons, all having wavelengths corresponding to their own energy. Last name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing this sentence, Dieppe is as exhausted as exhaustion, and all sorts of strange ideas in his mind emerge: "If the microscopic particles have The wave-particle two elephants have their own frequency of fluctuations, what about the macroscopic substances of the movement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a "ridiculous" promotion, Dieppe saw Seeing the existence of its own stability, shaking his head with a funny smile, the subconscious did not go deeper, and remembered something else: "The special theory of relativity can also be applied to the microscopic world represented by the new alchemy. The two systems are not completely read, and it seems that they can Unite in some way, maybe later Research must use each other's knowledge, such as the new alchemy of relativization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of divergent, quirky ideas with Dieppe mood The stability began to disappear, but he looked at the paper in front of him, and his heart still seemed to be holding a huge stone, which could not be said to be heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of the desk, Dieppe walked to the window and pushed the glass window away, blowing a steep breeze and biting chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Dieppe, who had no magic to perform, to make several chills in a row, and the brain was frozen so clearly that he saw the faint light on the horizon. The piece of white on the ground, wrapped in silver, seems to be a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s dawn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe whispered a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When breakfast, Dieppe, who is taking his own paper, does not see Teacher Lavindi, after hesitating and struggling, went straight to his study and slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in." Ravendi passed the feedback from the Magic Tower and knew that Dieppe was outside, so he refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What?” Raven asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diep hesitated again, fear, nervousness, worry, lack of self-confidence and many other emotions come to mind, I am afraid that no one can accept the results of his own derivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly say!" Lavendi is also an arcane singer who is used to roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diep bit his teeth and come up with the paper: "Teacher, this is my latest paper. I want to ask you to guide me and see what is wrong." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, no experiments have confirmed that there should be no situation in which the cognitive world is shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this hesitant?" Lavin’s voice said loudly, and took the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also hasn’t experienced much. It’s Fernando. When he meets with Lucien, he’s sure to ask if there’s any subversion, and to what extent. The subversion of the surname, what kind of "posture" should be used to correctly read the thesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe opened his mouth and didn’t spit out a word. I don’t know how to answer the teacher’s question. I can’t say that I’m worried about being snarled by you, worrying about the paper. It has been criticized for being worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laven first read this short paper and walked to the desk. Suddenly, his footsteps paused and his face looked like The opera actor is changing, shaking, indignation, anger, doubt, unacceptable, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe quietly took a step back and seemed to feel the terrorary pressure emanating from the teacher. He is already aware that the cognitive world can map and influence the present world. Top powerhouse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Raven’s return to God, looking at Dieppe:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do you tell me that electrons are waves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is depressed and low, as if it is a storm of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the microscopic particles should have two images of the wave..." Dieppe's words have not been finished, and the face is the roar of Raven: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me that electrons are waves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In our measurement of the quality of electrons, After observing its trajectory and determining that it has momentum and meets the conservation conditions, do you tell me it is a wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why don't you tell me, those Aristocratic lady, the aristocratic wife who actually gave birth to several children after marriage is actually a man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of a sentence makes Dieppe continue to step back until his back is against the door. Although the teacher’s analogy seems to be error-free, he always feels that the second-generation surname of the micro-world is simply extended to The macro world seems to be quite wrong, and: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some special magical creatures that are hermaphrodite, the nobles who have their blood. After the self-excitation can change the sex ...... "he whispered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s dark gray eyes stared at Dieppe, and there seemed to be a chaotic chaos around the scene: “Follow me to the lab.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe wiped his face and walked silently behind the teacher, seeing him stop in the Lucian cloud room and turning on the electromagnetic cyclotron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, you tell me, is the electron with such a wonderful trajectory a wave?" Raven snarled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dieppe does not need to know that the cloud room is a dreamy particle trajectory, so clear, so shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and said with a firm sense: "Electronics can also represent the particle's surname, which is a wave and a particle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of discourse is heard in Lavin's ear, just like someone is saying that he is a man and a man. He is a giant and a dwarf. He is a living person and a dead person. The ridiculous, so unreasonable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
