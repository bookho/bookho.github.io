			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest rated group meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente did not speak after Lucien: "The arcane must be based on an understandable visualization, and it is impossible to imagine something that cannot be understood. It is a complicated mathematical process, so, Brooke, Oliver, congratulations, this is the true foundation of the new alchemy, the orthodox theory in the microscopic field, your work has brought us back to the real land, not the embarrassment In the matrix maze, there is no foundation for drifting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nonsense, the true foundation of arcane is observable, something that cannot be observed is meaningless to us, naturally There is no need to impose an image on it.” Fernando used a stormy momentum to illustrate his views in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also added: "It is against the basic logic to use the image of the macro world in the microscopic field, and there will be big problems." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But no matter what, the electronics do show a fluctuating surname." Oliver joined the debate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that there are many half-planes coming, the wonderful landscape with frequent visions, Douglas tapped the table gently: "The debate on the wave equation waits until At the end of the meeting, we will first mourn for five minutes for Klaus, and we will let the Lord of Hell pay the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien closes his eyes and begins Silence, I hope that my own guess of the essence of the soul is correct, in that case...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the highest panel meeting discussed the Truth, Tanos, Wei Ken’s affairs basically agreed with Douglas, Fernando and Lucien’s proposal to use the true and false stories in the broadcast to shake the foundation of faith and confuse Viking, letting him think that the Magic Council did not find the most essential secrets, nor did it The agreement to reach a cooperation with the monster, at the same time, to hide the core intelligence, secretly draw the members of the differentiation cardinal group, play a role at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are fewer things that can be submitted to the highest-level panel, less than an hour, the meeting is over, and Helen, who has been learning, suddenly looks up: "If it is established The new alchemy system of the Oliver-Brook wave equation conforms to all current experiments and can solve the previous problems. What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rarely meets at the meeting So seriously, when she discussed the affairs of Viken, she had already had a rare energy to listen to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different theories can explain one thing at the same time, indicating that they should be equivalent in some way." Hathaway seems to have been thinking for a long time. "When the volatility surname and the particle surname are both electronic features and surnames, matrix mechanics and wave dynamics may be equivalent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, Fernando, Chelsea, Elika and others agree that they can nod. "You can give proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mathematics method should be fine." Brook thought about it. Also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver thinks it is possible, but it is not very happy. In his view, matrix mechanics should be a special manifestation of wave dynamics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussed for a while, the members of the highest panel of judges left, and Lucien and teacher Fernando went to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that Oliver's interpretation of the meaning of the wave function arcane is a bit problematic. In this case, there will be contradictions in solving the atomic model. Look at Oliver. How to explain." Fernansha thought seriously. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lucien nodded:. "arcane meaning of the wave function of interpretation of binding experiments phenomenon" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the month of the harvest (September), in the classroom of the Holt School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level magician Honoré, Clark and many other students are waiting for the "Institute of Education" teacher Ernesto to issue "Arcane" "Magic" "Nature" and other journals, the platform is standing on the platform of the "new alchemy basics" teacher Heidi, her face seems a bit bad, eyes look at the feet, feet rubbing to temper, like preparing to step on death Pile of ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honoré shook his head: "I am not familiar with Heidi's teacher. How do you know her? Perhaps the results of the Atomic Research Institute have been rejected by Lord Evans. Perhaps it is a conflict with a friend. It is hard to say clearly. It’s impossible to change the textbook of alchemy again?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh, how is it possible, wait a minute to be careful, don’t get angry Teacher Ti." Clarke thought too much, reminding Honoré. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Heidi strives to imitate Lucian’s style of class, everyone has their own family name. Gradually, she also has a “smile demon”. The title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ernesto walked in with a storage bag full of journals, his expression was strange and strange, and his voice was a bit cautious: "According to the order Receive a journal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last electron diffraction experiment, Honoré, who was familiar with Ernesto, saw his expression and thought Dao: "Is there any theoretical or experimental result of subverting the surname?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving three journals, Honoré could not wait to return to the seat and could not wait to turn over. up in the "arcane" first paper to find the answer: "the essence of the problem and the wave equation of quantum mechanics microscopic particles", author: Edwin? Brooke, Oliver? Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"wave equation, wave function..." Although after verifying the electron diffraction experiment, Honoré believes that its wave function will appear, but actually see At the time, I still couldn't help but shake the shock. The real microscopic particles actually have wave functions! This is incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Heidi’s face is not good! He suddenly realized this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sitting down again, Honoré felt that the surrounding atmosphere became quiet and filled with a touch of depression, similar to his own mood, the development of these months It’s really undulating, and it’s hard to adapt to the current rhythm of change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look at this paper quietly, Honoré is gradually addicted to it, familiar with the classic wave equation form, easy to understand calculations and concepts, than the head The matrix mechanics of pain and eye brows do not know how simple it is. Reading and reading, Honoré has a feeling of rising, almost tears full of money, this is the arcane, this is the basis of the new alchemy. ! Lord Brooke and Lord Oliver are so great! Have a genius brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a classic and great wave equation, more than a matrix mechanics, easy to learn!" I don't know who lost the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Heidi's low voice echoed in the big classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who spoke quickly shut up, and his heart groaned, of course! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Silver Moon League, in the pale hand, in a Where the magicians gather, there is a similar "touch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Arcane has finally returned to its original appearance!" The high-ranking magicians of the Silver Moon League after the destruction of general relativity and matrix mechanics almost The idea of ​​holding a banquet celebration:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Brooke, Lord Oliver made a contribution to change the times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I can't wait to spend all my time understanding it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Joaquin frowned and said: "The wave is really there. The basis of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to dispute light, electromagnetic waves are not waves, I don’t think that even the basic particles of matter exist are waves, and they are unexpectedly obtained. A comprehensive victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The surnames of electrons and photons are also very obvious..." Ulysian poured a cold water on the president, "and starting from the wave equation Whether or not to build a new alchemy system is still a matter of verification and derivation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Akin and other magicians have a clear understanding of this, because of the recent ten During the year, most of the arcane masters who did not have such an attitude retired from the stage of arcaneism and even the stage of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
