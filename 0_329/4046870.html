			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver and white entangled magical arrays illuminate the electric light, enveloping the fissile material in the center, and the resulting majestic energy passes nearby The conversion magic array becomes a variety of energy sources that the "city of the sky" can use. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the fission reactor has no feeling of being fierce and fierce to be unable to suppress, although it still contains great danger, but it has become very stable and controllable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, congratulations to you and Hathaway, Mr. Ravendi, President Morris." Lucien said sincerely, in this achievement, In addition to proposing fission reactions and helping to analyze the causes of self-explosion, they have made little contribution. This is the crystallization of their four legendary wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of this fission reactor is no more than that on the earth. Because of the combination of reverse cracking and forward theory, there are often various unknown dangers in the middle. Encountering self-destruction and cursing, so no one under the legend participated in the actual construction. In the absence of manpower, Fernando and Hathaway took the legend of the two elements of Lavindi and Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face with a smile, but snorted: “It’s too long to be stupid, and I’ve gone a lot of detours.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the harsh demands and habits of the results, he did not even let himself go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, with a stable large fission reactor, the 'city of the sky' has a standing source of energy, which can be said to be our energy well research. A huge breakthrough, our energy problems will be effectively solved before." Lucien is quite happy with this achievement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took care of his messy hair, and the slightly turbid red eyes focused on the fission reactor: "The next step is the miniaturization of the fission reactor. At that time, artificial planets, airships, cosmic observatories, and some steam trains that need strong defense and attack magic arrays will get a powerful beating 'heart'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, artificial planets, airships, etc. can complete the laser beam, electromagnetic guns, kinetic weapons and other attacks that need to consume huge energy. In the three-dimensional concept of war, the original ground, sky, and surrounding space are blocked. In addition, it will be added to space... Lu Xien heard the teacher's words. Subconsciously think of the change of the form of war. When the two sides are fighting, in the absence of magical fluctuations, suddenly the real "rock" is not a dream. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the magic world, miniaturization is much simpler than previous stabilization! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that the energy of the fission reactor is still not enough. If we can complete the controllable, stabilized and miniaturized nuclear fusion, then we are all The Sun King, a good-looking novel: "Lu Xien exaggerated in a humorous tone. “And, many particle experiments in the microscopic field can be put on the agenda. The super-large particle collider that I proposed at the highest scoring group meeting should also be included in the secret project of the Magic Research Council.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many studies in the microscopic field, fission reactors are indispensable. They can provide a large number of particles that are difficult to find under normal conditions, and can also directly participate in the experimental process, so stable fission Reactors are the result of urgent research in the micro-field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien proposes the Very Large Particle Collider because the current electromagnetic cyclotron and the collision magic array in the Magic Lab provide higher energy for the particles. And so on, more and more can not keep up with the needs of high-level arcanes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, when I was doing neutron-based research, I discovered the importance of a stable fission reactor." When it comes to arcane research, Fernando’s expression It became very serious and serious. Then he smiled and laughed at himself: "I don't think that neutrons of different speeds will cause such a huge contrast..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of it. He became somewhat thoughtful: "The large number of experiments with neutrons and protons have given me an illusion. Maybe they are not necessarily elementary particles. For example, the overweight particles that can participate in nuclear power make me feel weird." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, by the influence of Heidi’s discovery of new particles (scorpions), more and more Arcans have devoted themselves to the study of cosmic rays. in. Both the Atomic Research Institute and the High Tower's Cosmic Observatory have reached a point where it is very difficult to apply. It is normal to line up for two or three months, and Annick et al. found a positive and uncharged dice, a tall tower. Annonis discovered a particle that is heavier than protons and neutrons, and it can participate in strong interactions (nuclear forces), initially named "super". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that as time goes by, in the microscopic field research, the great arcans and legendary magicians are no longer following themselves step by step, but have their own independent expansion and research after digestion and absorption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s arcane attitude is open, Fernando has not said anything more, and there is no experiment or phenomenon in itself. This question can be clearly drawn, only from In his own arcane intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to hurry and discuss the miniaturization problem with Hathaway." Once there is nothing else, Fernando’s impetuous character surfaced. , hastily left the core of the "city of the sky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small size... This is beyond the limits of the earth..." Lucien smiled and shook his head. This is both a beautiful road and a lot of danger. For example, whether the miniaturized fission device is vulnerable or not, and whether the nuclear leak has a mature treatment method, in this respect, the fusion device is much safer, and the explosion is damaged within the scope of the explosion, and there is no long-term hidden danger and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Institute of Atomic Studies, Lucien saw it. Heidi’s “sad” look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, you are late..." Heidi prepared a long report, and he was a little nervous, and the teacher who arrived early was late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is in a good mood: "A little sudden delay, start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heidi put away the deliberately put on the expression, and entered the exclusive laboratory with Cherie, Lovi, Ophelia and others, Lazar, Annick, Sprint, etc. The surgeons all followed in. For them, this kind of report can let them harvest new things every time, especially in areas where their own research is not much, so they can be bypassed. Even though Lucien did not mandate that they must participate as a monthly seminar, they spontaneously joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Heidi, Cherie and others’ "artificial intelligence" is much smaller than last time. Although it is still a giant, it is barely acceptable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi turned on the power, a slight current sounded, and the red and green lights began to flash, a good-looking novel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the last trial run. We found a lot of problems and made the following improvements..." The things introduced are naturally the most cheerful and well-talked sea. Tilai finished. While manipulating "artificial intelligence", she introduces her own design theory, specific design ideas, modular applications, and program storage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this distance from real arcane research seems quite far away, under Lucien’s “tune-up”, the people who are on the sidelines are experts who are good at mathematics. It is a two or three elites who specialize in experiencing the knowledge of the various departments. Naturally, they can hear the mathematical ideas and simulations of human thinking activities, and the system that represents everything with 0 and 1 numbers gives them The deep shock seems to be a great manifestation of the "simple beauty" in the arcane, which seems to symbolize the simplicity and mystery of the essence of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi’s introduction, “provocatively” looked at Sprint: “You didn’t say it last time. The mental arithmetic speed is better than our 'artificial intelligence’ Is it faster? Is it better than one?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint has always had strong self-confidence, even near, so he snorted: "Okay, If you lose, you have to help me with a one-month lab assistant. If I lose, it will be the same, but you can't ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, he looks at Lucien: "I also ask the teacher to ask questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and picked a difficulty that required more data calculations. The topic, then smile announces the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light is constantly flashing, so quickly that people can’t tell, the whole lab becomes like a dance occasion. After four seconds, the sound of the beep sounds, the sea Tie Xing cheerfully said: "The result is out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is mentally input, so the input does not take any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint looked up and looked at Heidi in disbelief. After another ten seconds, he whispered: "I count Come out, this is the result... try again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
