			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s state at this time is similar to that of a half-dream, and only the surrounding things are fluttering and screaming, like a passing through countless worlds. It fell into the ear. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the "Alvin" old pain is different from the usual voice after entering the ear of Lucien, it took a few seconds to form in his mind. impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 曰 冕?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of God Alvin knows what?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it’s so unusual, so weird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s slow brain Just like there are countless magical outbursts that affect emotions, there is a moment of vibration spread from the depths of the soul, which makes him briefly recover from waking, and asks with a slight trembling and unbelievable voice:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mas...Kilin...Mr.?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Upon hearing the name Maskillin, " The Eye of God, Alvin was holding his head in his death, making a screaming scream, as if the pain was struggling to the extreme, the breeze of the blue body, the burning sun turned into the wind blade of the sky, and the light swept the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s short-lived waking was suppressed by the “sleep of the wind”, and it seemed that he understood something in his heart, but it was difficult to turn his mind. At that time, The wind blade and the light vector hit him without exception, and some broke through the defense of the "Great Arcane robes" and hurt his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds are blooming, but no blood flows out, because they are either vaporized or blown dry, and this severe pain helps Lucien suppress it again. "The Sleep of the Wind" and "The Light of Heaven" are ready to hit the black door behind them and strive for the hope of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of God" Alvin’s state at this time is clearly not suitable for conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "light of heaven" is a repression of the level of the gods, although there is no follow-up power, it has been eliminated a lot by the previous magic, but Lucien is now The state affected by the "sleep of the wind" wants to really eliminate its negative effects is hopeless, so when it just hit the back door, the mental power is running hard, and the associated soul becomes dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien’s voice hitting the black door was introduced into Alva’s ear, and his painful struggle was like a crazy alarm clock being pressed. The switch immediately stopped, and the wind blade and light in the entire gray hall disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly raising his head, Alvin’s expression is still distorted, deep in the eyes like the starry sky, the two rows of golden tears faintly sacred from the corner of his eyes. Muttered to himself: "Don't be near me! Don't approach me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean?" Lucien thought slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin seems to be trying to control himself, no more talking, behind the six holy wings gently fanning, the milky white light as the mother's caress falls in Lucy En, warm and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of sleeping suddenly disappeared without disappearing. Lucien was sober as if he had just meditated, "The Angel of the Wind" Alvin lifted the "sleep of the wind" The magic effect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without its cooperation, Lucien quickly suppressed the "light of heaven", although there was no way to alleviate the impact, but also recovered to "Alvin "The state before the battle, at least the ability to cast legendary magic, can transform into an epic knight to pick up the sword of truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one minute, Lucien experienced hope, struggled and went to the dawn process, as if he had turned around on the edge of death, his body and mind were abnormal. Exhausted, there are many gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alvin is probably Mr. Muskilllin, but looking at him, it seems that he was reborn as a blazing angel and erased. The superficial consciousness and memory have created a new personality and imposed many curses and restrictions, so he will be so contradictory when he is awakened in the subconscious, so conflicting, so painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After the mind resumed waking, the Arcane Master’s thinking ability also returned, and Lucien analyzed the state of Alvin, or Muskilllin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not Mr. Muskilllin. Through the "Mirror of Destiny", it has been predicted that there will be similar encounters. This will leave the shackles and try to awaken the deepest consciousness rooted in the soul, if you become his own. Maybe it will never be restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the overall structure of '曰之冕' has a very memorable value for Mr. Muskilllin, and is linked to certain things. When this sensed it, it immediately revived the deep consciousness. After Lucian became a legendary magician, he carefully examined the "曰之冕", and with his current depth of knowledge, he must have confirmed "曰"There is no hiding of other things, so the above judgment is made. This is like a hypnotic prop. The subject will be relieved of hypnosis if he sees it." It seems that when he was refined into a blazing angel, Mr. Muskilllin I didn’t take the opportunity to plant my own hints.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t mean to be close to him should be literally, if a stranger is too close, it will Inducing the body's defense instinct, let the personality of 'Alvin' prevail, completely suppressing 'Maskillin', then I will be in a dangerous situation again." Lucien analyzes the previous situation and decides between words. Nor can it be too irritating, "Alvin, After a little discretion tone, "I stand at the Grand Cross of the Star fans lock to get the crown and leave a message saying, legendary magician follows the commitment to come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin's eyes are kept empty and ignorant, but the corners of the mouth are faintly smirked, and laughing is more ugly than crying: "I finally waited until this day," An unbelievers who walk between light and darkness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is still old and sad.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Lucien quietly vomited, from This answer finally confirmed that he is Maskillin, the prophet Maskilin! By analogy, the other five blazing angels and the king of angels are probably just six other legendary magicians, the number just right.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need anything to help me? Lucien tried not to mention words such as salvation, monsters, sun kings, and tyros.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maskini dreamed: "I only predicted that The scene, I did not expect it to be so powerful, even if I really recovered myself, it is difficult to escape, you are the same, leave, wait until you become a god, come here again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have been trapped here by monsters, and I have to know the secrets of it. Lucien said, while preparing to prevent Maskillin from getting out of control.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original should be the blazing angel of the "Sun King" Refining?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Lucien’s dignified focus, Muskelin’s face is still holding his head, his face twisted and he’s calm for a while. Down, first show the magic: "God's grace! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint light of the sacred light falls into the body of Lucien, and the strong breath of life makes Lucien confirm that it is to eliminate negative conditions and treat injuries. God, so there is no time and space to defend.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the legendary resurrection, "God's Grace" is the highest healing theology, Lucien I felt that the wound was recovering at an unimaginable speed. The "light of heaven" that was "immersed" in the body quickly passed away. Although it was higher than "the grace of God", it had neither follow-up support nor met with a very good understanding of its special surname. Blazing angels, so in just a few seconds, Lucien completely got rid of the influence of "the light of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic is very wonderful, even the blood king Rhein has also been treated, eliminating the effects of the “light of heaven”, which is completely different from ordinary healing therapies that can only cause serious injuries in undead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is limited by many powerful means, and you can't discuss certain things, or you will self-destruct immediately. Muskilllin said that he met the words of Lucian's guess. "Go to the lab. I will leave the mirror of fate to guide you to the lab. If you find enough residual notebooks and items, you should be able to solve it." Open some secrets and understand the way to escape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Lucien once again vomited, and there are ways to get rid of or bypass the monster!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the notebook you left is missing in key places, otherwise things will not be so foggy." Lucien sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maskili's mouth moved, his eyes suddenly glowed, his fearful look, as if recalling the most A terrible nightmare, the voice sternly said: "Not him, it is him! Not him, it is him! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
