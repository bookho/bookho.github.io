			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 3rd, Alto Music Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious and melodious street full of melodic reverberations, Lucien is not always dressed as a formal dress or dress, but a simple brown-red long coat and white shirt. Black trousers, casual shoes, wandering around with ease, followed by Ai Wen dressed as a small gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel and Eliza want to revisit the date when they were young, so they paid Evanto to Lucien to look after, and Victor came because of a lot of foreign Aristocrats, musicians, musicians and friends, these days, hospitality, salons, banquets are too busy, and Felice, Lott, etc. as his students, of course, will be happy to help him share the busy and participate in this gathering, after all, a wide range of contacts It also plays an important role for musicians, only considering the pressure of Lucien as the ending concert, they have not tacitly invited Lucian to let him prepare with peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha wants to treat Prince Michael as a guest, and cares about her lover Silvia’s concert, temporarily to Lucien This "damaged friend" forgot to go back. Elena was naturally unable to get out of the music association. The orchestra of Rheinland accepted invitations from several concerts. It is said that she will be busy and have no time to fill up. belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Sinen thought that at least John was a good friend. Who knows, because of the shortage of manpower, John was drawn to maintain street policing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I can take a child with such a romantic occasion." Lucien looked helplessly at the food, his mouth kept on. The squirming Ai Wen, spread the hand to John on the street. "This is really a sad story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is focused on food and simply ignores Lucy. En complained, and John, who maintained law and order on the street, couldn’t help but laugh: "Luxien, isn’t there a few noble ladies invited you? For example, Miss Yvette of the Hill family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly half a year of honing by Sir Wien, John’s temperament is more stable, and the brilliant blonde keeps the right length, with a silver-gray chain mail, which looks handsome and straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I still concentrate on bringing children." Lucien pulled Ai Wen, who did not look at the road, bid farewell to John and began to enjoy the music festival. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music festival will leave afterwards, I don’t know if it is possible to come back, so Lucien didn’t stay at home, but took to the streets, “really” Participate in thrift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street pedestrians, street performers, etc. have not increased significantly compared to the previous days, because there have been many, and the biggest change is that those who want to rent The bands in which the house opened the concert all began to sway their musical dreams by encircling an open space on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Avon and other children most satisfied is the food stalls on the street, there are pies, cheese, barbecue, cake desserts, etc. Once he had finished eating his hands, he would sneak into the East and then quietly influence the direction of Lucien and let him turn to the stalls in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A street car in the center of the street slowly drove through the four-corner creatures like the bulls, the band is a little famous to show their music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, Lucien pulled Ai Wen away casually, and occasionally saw a concert hall, walked straight in and listened quietly. One paragraph, then smiled out, hang out on the street, and then repeat the previous process, freely, free from any restraint, forget all the troubles and depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Alto Music Festival, in addition to the St. Hall, the price of all concert halls is cheap to the extreme, often four or five copper nare can go in and listen to an afternoon. There are even a lot of concert halls. Because the "musicians" and the orchestras who want to be famous are paying for themselves, they can listen for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the music festival that belongs to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near noon, Lucien took Ai Wen on the street to find a more lively and chaotic restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Butn, Big Brother, look..." When I entered the door, Ai Wen pointed to the words on the big wooden sign at the door. "Respected guests, for Celebrate our common music festival, as long as you are willing to play in the restaurant, we will save half of your meal, and if your performance is warmly applauded, you will enjoy lunch or dinner for free." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien laughed and said: "The owner of this restaurant is really generous, but only in such a restaurant can you feel the atmosphere of the festival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restaurant, led by the hostess, Lucien and Ai Wen finally found a small table, and other places have long been crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two lemon steaks were ordered, and Lucian sat in the position, smiling at the stage in the center of the restaurant, where an old gentleman was struggling to play The piano, I can see that he has not studied this instrument, the notes are messy, and can be called noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the old gentleman played very seriously, like playing his own concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished playing, the whole restaurant sang a warm applause, for his courage and perseverance, to participate in the joy of the festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This gentleman will enjoy his lunch for free!" The restaurant owner, a man in his thirties and glasses, applauded with a strong applause. Mr. Mr. went up to perform?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one laughed, only encouragement, this atmosphere infected many people, so more and more diners went to play violin, viola Musical instruments such as pianos and flutes make the melody of music always echo in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the warm applause like the old gentleman did not reappear, more is to encourage the surname, but for those performers, such an occasion is like I was in a concert and got a huge satisfaction of my dreams. Together with half of the meal, everyone was very satisfied and happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Sien, like Ai Wen, while eating steak, blended into this lively and cheerful atmosphere, and worked hard after each performer Applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of this restaurant has attracted more and more pedestrians to come and eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly plunged into the atmosphere, and even if there were no seats, they would rather look at the side of the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola, Sharon was looking for food after a morning show, and noticed this strange restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Europe, Piola, go up and perform!" Leslie figured out what was going on, immediately encouraged Piola to go up, and he wanted to try again. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola did not refuse, excitedly walked up and pulled up the violin, a light and enthusiastic waltz slowly appeared with the melody, let everyone I couldn't help but sway and sway, and pushed the lively atmosphere to a more fierce fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tidal applause drowned Piola, he had never been so welcomed, excited to play again before leaving the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This handsome guy, and his companions will enjoy a free lunch." The boss announced the opportunity to get a huge cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith and Sarah happily after enjoying a morning music festival in Aalto, attracted by this huge cheer, curiously walked in to eat, then It is conquered by such an atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lu Xien put down his knife and fork and looked at Ai Wen, who couldn’t eat it. He smiled and said: "I have never let you eat so much." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, I can't help but see those delicious foods." Ai Wen looked sadly at the remaining half of the steak, let the reception help package Get up, then he is very excited: "Large, you also go up and play one, so you don't have to pay the bill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, As the music genius of Lucian, going up, there is no doubt that the most enthusiastic applause will be won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien appreciated the performances of those in front, and the emotions were more active by the atmosphere. After hearing the advice of Ai Wen, there was a little bit of change, no In the case of knowing who you are, can you be welcomed by your own musical ability without plagiarizing your own music? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien stood up and walked to the simple stage in the center of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others put down the knife and fork and followed the applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith saw Lucien on the stage and almost dropped the plate with bread, butter and roast on the ground, whispering to Sarah Road: "Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s indeed Mr. Evans, but isn’t he going to prepare for the final day of the concert?” Sarah confirmed Lilith’s judgment, full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith was immediately excited: "No matter why Mr. Evans will be here, it is the most wonderful thing to hear him playing himself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Peola also recognized Lucien, and smiled at Grace: "It is the gentleman with high musical literacy, I don't know him. How about playing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be no worse." Grace and Sharon smiled and answered at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sat in front of the piano, hands on the keys, recalling a light music melody he wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lite a large-scale, well-structured classical music, Lucien still does not have that ability, but in his spare time, he will also try to create light music with a small structure and simple melody. Relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without reading the Soul Library, Lucien recalled a few pieces of light music melody that he had heard in his life, and expanded them with their own musical knowledge to perfect their lightness. Structure, the spectrum has written a few long, own semi-original melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a finger press, a soothing melodic melody is produced in the lively hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a breeze blowing through the trees in spring, like a pure spring water flowing, the hall’s noisy seems to be infected, slowly calming down, beautiful and clear The music seems to be placed in a refreshing, natural, picturesque landscape that becomes quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression is calm and quiet, his eyes are closed slightly, his fingers are beating gracefully on the keyboard, and the body gently undulates with the melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith looked at Lucine like this. When I heard such music, the whole person became calm and happy, and my heart silently thought: "This music is really true." Great, at least, at least, compared to those symphonies, I prefer Mr. Evans's pure and beautiful simple melody. Hey, Mr. Evans, who concentrates on playing the piano, is really elegant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a feeling of exhaustion and a feeling of tranquility after the extreme excitement. Lucien’s light music just hit their hearts, and the whole hall is not only melodious piano melodies, but also the whole hall. No one is talking anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This melody is very short, it ends in less than two minutes, and all the audience are still immersed in the atmosphere just did not return, so there is no applause. Quiet and unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was very pleased with this reaction, hurried off the stage, took Ai Wen, lost a Yinnar to entertain, and then went outside the restaurant. Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the gate, Lucien heard the huge applause bursting out of the restaurant, more eager than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Forgot to ask the name of the gentleman." Piola, who was awake, blamed himself angrily. "He must be an excellent person." "The musician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon reminisced about the previous performance: "The melody was really beautiful, and then expanded, improved and filled with some structure, it was a good one. The piano piece is gone. I have never heard this melody before, huh, huh, not Aalto, I never know how much music I have heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She does not think that it was created by Lucien. She only feels that the music capital is full of surprises. After all, many new or not famous music is not transmitted to the "Pearl of the Sea" so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gentleman’s playing has an unspeakable charm. The piano sound and sound quality are also very good. I started to think about whether or not to give up the plume. The piano." Grace is very yearning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Butne, why are you giving money?" Ivan was very puzzled at the restaurant, and he heard the very warm applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
