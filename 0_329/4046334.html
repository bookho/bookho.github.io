			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least high-level magicians here, even though Lucien’s description is simple, abstract, and vague, it does not prevent them from recognizing the value of this direction. The illusion magic is further incorporated into the breakthrough results of the current arcane system, and the meaning is not significant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang Spectrum and Leahy? Carter suddenly had an unreal feeling. Lucien was only in the first discussion meeting, and he was able to throw such a shocking surname in the field of illusion and electromagnetics. The genius was overdone, and there were only a few big arcane in memory. The teacher has had similar experience, and is he good at astrology, illusion and electromagnetic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After Roland accepted the theory of energy essence, he guessed that the thinking activities of human beings were essentially the effect of energy current and magnetic field. Unfortunately, his research direction was too Many, the energy essence theory has too many loopholes. In order to deal with the martyrdom of energy essence theory, he has no time to study his human brain electromagnetic field theory." The storm dominated the tone and introduced the students some progress in this direction. Obviously, he can hear his sarcasm about Roland - he missed an opportunity to perfect the current arcane system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy essence is not the point, the point is that when there is no direct evidence, experiment and magic to verify a theory, there are still so many loopholes in it, so many When it comes to the point of saying it, it’s really stupid to stick to it blindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction, the storm dominated Fernando to look at Lucien: "You will discover the process in detail, many arguments can be boldly assumed, but must be carefully verified." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When discussing arcane, he has no humor or wretched temperament, his expression is serious, his voice is not in a hurry, he does not hear the words of Lucien when he hears the human brain. There are indeed special electromagnetic waves that affect people's emotions and actions, so he is asked to explain in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his presiding over the regular meeting, there is no fear that Axikana and other students will plagiarize the results of Lucien, as for himself, whether it is arcane or not. The reputation, or the wealth of wealth, is close to the peak, more emphasis on the exploration of the essence, the discovery of the law, the understanding of the world, rarely consider the virtual name on the arcane and magic achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Initially because I got some of the "Book of Necromancer", through comparison, I found that the magical part of the 'Charming Humans' structure involves the soul, while the rest Part of it doesn't know what it is. Based on the idea of ​​curiosity and exploration, I have studied this part of the structure for a long time, and by chance, compared with the magical structure of mechanized mind, I found that there are some similarities, so I boldly improved the charm. Human magic, I can't think of success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien talked and reversed the order of transforming the charm of human magic, from theoretical guidance and purposeful The surname enhancement structure became an attempt to improve the surname based on other magical similar structures, but this situation is too numerous to be considered in the magic research, regardless of whether Fernando is a great arcian or other high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My attempt is blind and lucky, but since magic can be successfully displayed and achieved its purpose, it means that this magic structure is not blind and lucky, behind the affirmation There is a hidden law, but I still can't understand the meaning of the mapping and mapping. I have been trying to understand this magic until I touch the electromagnetic wave theory and find that they are similar..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernan did not interrupt the student’s words, but spurred and corrected. Instead, he nodded lightly and agreed to Lucien’s way of thinking, indicating that he would continue. Many magicians created new magic by accident or coincidence, but they thought it was their own luck. The success of magic was also a fluke. They did not explore the reasons and laws hidden behind the success of magic, and missed many valuables. The discovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In this aspect of research, I have been intermittent, chaos has no direction, once discovered the existence of weak currents in the human body, and also found out how many human brains Special electromagnetic waves, but they don't understand their meaning at all, until they are stimulated by the real dreams of the king of nightmare, inspired by his discourses that distinguish between reality and dreams. They are composed of the energy of the human body by Roland Master, and the electromagnetic waves are descriptions of external manifestations. Touching, the research results of Isabella's magician mentioned by Ms. Axikana shocked, and I finally understood the hidden rules behind the magic that I improved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"When encountering different things, the human brain produces different special electromagnetic waves that stimulate the body to secrete similar alchemy substances discovered by Ms. Isabella, which produces emotions and feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando asked meticulously: "There is a human body current with a special electromagnetic wave. Did you find the human brain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, maybe the experiment is too high, The surrounding interference is too strong." Lucien shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando continued to ask: "There are several special electromagnetic waves, which correspond to the secretion of what kind of alchemy substances, what emotions and hallucinations?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through the analysis of some illusion magic, I found a special electromagnetic wave in several frequency bands, but I don't know the secretion of what kind of alchemy material, but after adjusting the electromagnetic wave intensity, it is obvious. You can see..." Lucien probably explained the changes in some emotions and hallucinations under different brainwave stimuli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando maintains a serious expression, and raises questions for Lucian’s research results. He asks Lucian to feel a little cold and sweaty, and there is no way to answer in many places. Fortunately, it has been said in advance that it is just straightening out the idea and it will not be revealed. After many problems, Fernando finally calmed down the question and commented: "Emotions and feelings are numerous. It is difficult to control the secretion of alchemy materials by only a few brain waves." There are a lot of things you lack in research, and many questions remain on the assumptions. You still have a lot to go in this area of ​​research. But arcane research needs discussion, and you can write a paper submission as soon as possible. If you don't mind, You can show us the 'glamorous humans' of two different spellcasting objects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try! I will try!" Affris slammed It’s the most magical and mental illusion magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum looked helplessly: "Aphras, this is a charm of humanity, not a charm dragon..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I forgot..." Affris looked at everyone innocently, his tail glimpsed, and he was completely unaware of being a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucine showed the charm of two different objects, Fernando nodded slightly: "Your magic has come before your theory. But there is improvement." As a testimony to the magic, you will be attacked a lot less. You must know that some magicians who are good at illusion are very conservative, and still maintain the tradition of the ancient magical empire. Although they recognize and study the theory of arcane, they are unwilling to accept the theory of arcane to explain the illusion. Magic, there is a kind of self-esteem and noble attitude. And this part of the magician, they are high in status, strong in strength, and many disciples are the mainstream of the illusionists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every A theory of creating a surname is more or less confronted with martyrdom. Lucien is not surprised by this, both worlds are the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Fernando’s series of questions, Asikana’s look at the monster’s eyes eased a lot, because it’s obvious that Lucien had a similar study before. However, I just straightened out my thoughts, and I became good at illusion and electromagnetics. She smiled slightly: "Evans, maybe you can share the wizard's title with Isabella with this research, as long as the stubborn guys of the Wizard House are willing to accept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My theory has a lot of loopholes. It is very difficult to get the sorcerer's laurels. It is not supported by Ms. Isabella's long-term observation, complete experiments, and collected alchemy materials." Lucian is very open-minded. Reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Affrisi heard the wizard’s laurels and turned his head. Amber’s slightly transparent eyes stared at Lucien, then The two front paws slammed and slammed on Lucien, and the bright red tongue slammed into the right hand in an extremely affectionate manner, which scared Lucien to directly launch the spell absorbing wall, and then watched the wall smashed. Staggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you add a name to your paper?" Averys swayed the tail of a crystal-like scale, and his voice was extremely sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this guy a dragon or a dog? Lucien reluctantly thought that a dragon would be like a puppy, and Fernando would be a great arcane master with a metamorphosis, but it seems that Aphrodite is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando coughed: "Aphrodite is sitting, Chloe, you talk about recent research."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris reluctantly took back his tongue and claws and took the time to add: "I am good at the magic of the soul, spirit, and soul. The strength has reached a high level, and the melee ability is also very strong. Can also be used as experimental materials, can accept a variety of dress, can accompany you or your students, children to play, can help you write papers, solve problems, do experiments, can help you send letters to women, send flowers ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
