			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Before Sanjiang, I never thought that I would be ranked first, but your support allowed me to stay in the house for a few days, I am very happy. Although there is no expectation that it will defeat the great god, after all, the reader base is there, but it is good to be able to stay for a while. Please continue to support Sanjiang Tickets~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... .............................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I can get the magic materials and items that I need, Lucien stops the guidance of the magic apprentices such as Sage, Smyr, White Honey, Mercury, etc., and suppresses the voice, and smiles slyly: "Hey, This is the end here, and I will explain it to you the next time I attend the party."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have realized that knowledge is equal to money and very lack of money. Lucien, who longs for money, certainly won't take his knowledge to exchange some useless things, and his own Also very solid foundation, consolidating in the back, review, learning before, put it more but dew depression, properly maintained some mystery best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to get a senior, profound formal magician to guide so many magic problems, the Sage and others are very satisfied, and even feel that they are paying, Far less than the harvest, so they all stood up, the right hand to help the amount, the ancient sorcerer tribute to the ceremonial ceremonies deeply expressed, express their gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, next, we will begin the exchange of items, 'knowledge' between us, and the magic discussion, welcome to you." The sage is full of joy Said to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called magic discussion is different from "guidance", but everyone talks about some magical issues and discusses each other. It is completely open, if there is not even a problem. If you are willing to express your opinion, you can leave after you have exchanged the items. The Sage invites Lucien to represent all magic apprentices, which means he can only listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in the eyes of sages, white honey, mercury and other magic apprentices, such a gentleman with extensive knowledge and strength, certainly can’t care about himself. If you can invite him to listen to the problem of the superficial, apprentice-level magic discussed by others, then on some issues, he may suddenly have a chance to speak one or two sentences, which will be what he and others have been waiting for. reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien currently has some apprentice-level magic, but because of the interference brought by his own knowledge that is not yet fully grasped, the analysis is not smooth. Moreover, in the magic casting, matching, and skill, it is only in the stage of being limited to the witch's notes and groping for themselves. Therefore, after hearing the invitation of the sage, it is simply being smashed by a lot of money, suppressing the joy and calmly answering. "Then I will listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Professor." White honey was greeted with a hoarse voice with a little surname. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten magic apprentices exchanged items and knowledge, their discussion officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most of the magical puzzles that need guidance today have been solved by Lucien, the rest have been solved a lot in the knowledge and exchange of goods. So after discussing a few puzzles, they started the magical analysis, the release of specific magic and the collocation of application-like problems, just like Lucien expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every magic apprentice must have retained his own unique skills and knowledge, but only the general magic application discussion, let Lucien gain a lot, greatly To make up for the shortcomings in the application of apprenticeship magic, the gap between magic knowledge and application has been filled in, so I listened with concentration and concentrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a hood cover, in the eyes of magical apprentices such as white honey, eucalyptus, and sage, the powerful and mysterious professor is completely blind to himself. Waiting for a shallow discussion, quietly thinking about the deep problems on the side, which makes them inevitably have a little disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning of the morning, the magic apprentices stopped discussing and changed some of the Melzer Black Forest and the news of several well-known ruins nearby. This time, the secret meeting was officially over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr. Professor left Mr. Professor to leave the basement, the sage said sincerely: "Mr. Dear Professor, if there is news of grudges, at the party, I I will tell you directly, of course, if you don't want to delay the time, you can give me a contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury sighed slightly and looked a little disappointed: "Mr. Professor, after two weeks, will you come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magic apprentices around The gaze under the cover of the hood seems to focus on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at the situation, you may go to the depths of the Black Forest in Melzer, or it may be the key time of the magic experiment. Anyone after two weeks will say no. Quasi." Lucien is prepared to make his own participation in the secret meeting to make random behavior, making people guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least not directly refused!" Magic apprentices such as Mercury comforted themselves with a little relaxation, before they worried that there was no temptation for the "Arcane" journal, this mystery Mr. "Professor" will not come again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s harvest this time, in addition to the magic application, there are a lot of real material, especially the magic test utensils are the heaviest, fortunately Lu Xien insisted on exercising during this time. Compared with the past, the strength did not grow up. He did not appear to be embarrassed when he climbed the ladder to leave the basement. He lost his grace and forgot his vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the basement, Smyr communicated with his own magical owl, Doro, at a close distance, seeing it swaying and showing no abnormalities. Signal Lucian, and the magic apprentices who follow will leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark, like a piece of fabric dyed in darkness, Lucien randomly chooses a direction that is completely different from other people, and does not panic and hurriedly walks fast. In the familiar slum area, the east turns around the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more spacious place, Lucien suddenly stood still and said coldly: "Hello, come out, don't follow me anymore."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet, still dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have found you, don't hide again, there is nothing to do with it, just ask me in person." Lucien has The horrible ice and cold breath is emitted, as if there is a powerful magic to cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien did not find anything, just be careful, use the bluffing tricks of the bad guys and evil wizards to swindle people, lest they be really Tracked, after all, like the mercury, white honey and other people behind the existence of a formal magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a silent darkness, just as Lucien is ready to go home in accordance with the reservation, there is a tree on the top of the tree in front. Only the crow flew up and left in the other direction, as if it was noisy by the voice of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s really being tracked by someone’s magic pet or summoning creatures, or just happened to be surprised by this crow. In short, Lucien is still very happy with this effect. Then, the pretense shook his head deeply: "True..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffocation of the "Avenger of the Snow and the Snow" converges, Lucian quickly steps into a Streets that are full of slums, if you are not familiar with the people here, you will definitely get lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While spreading the spirit, while turning continuously in the Kushiro, and finally finally leaving from an exit, Lucien sees that there is still no discovery. I will return to my home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is already the limit of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the hut, nothing happened, and Lucien finally put down her concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A late night after a week, in the cabin of Lucien, put In a small kitchen-like place with a stove and a crock, there was a big black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a three-meter-long, 2.5-meter-wide, one-person-high basement. This is the day after seven days in Lucien. In the laboratory built by the magical stone, the basement wall is a hard stone. The small magic array that eliminates the echo is arranged on the top, so that when people enter their own house, they will accidentally go to this place and judge from the sound of the footsteps. The following is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basement, Lucien stepped on the stool, holding a silver dagger with a magic rune, pushing it above with concentrated mental power. The walls are lined with straight lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
