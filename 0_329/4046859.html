			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus appears in a dragon form rather than a human form, indicating that he has a deep-rooted resentment against human beings. After all, the pope who killed his wife Aphroda is human. Most members of the Church of Truth are also human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he spoke, it seemed as if an invisible wind blew through the venue, bringing a long-distance feeling. The charcoal-gray scales had no pupils, only one layer. Another layer of transparent enamel, like the long time of the eternal return, and this makes Danissos like a high-historic historical witness, watching the world and life changes indifferently, but Rarely step into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Lucien felt that his eyes reaching Nisos were looking at himself, looking at himself coldly and indifferently, letting himself scream a slight shudder It seems that it is paralyzed as the surrounding time slows down. The "moon time" light in the vest pocket is also stained with a layer of char, as if eclipsed by the "ruler" of this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien was ready to unfold, and the half-plane projection blended with Danisos, he suddenly moved away from his sight, without questioning why Lucy Enhui was invited to appear here, but looked at the legendary powerhouses of the dozens of dark worlds and repeated it: "The meeting begins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time With the Glorious Dragon, 'The Ear of Silvereye' and 'The Abyssal Lord' have not arrived yet, they all have very important influences in their respective races or spheres of influence, and they are likely to have different opinions. I think we should wait for another "There are not many members of the dark parliament who dare to directly refute the opinions of the ancient time Dragon Danisus. The "brain of the elderly" is one of them, because he is the mysterious "master" "deputy" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of Silvereye" is the first generation of blood, the only legend that can directly summon the arrival of the silver moon, has a pivotal position in the blood family, no more than Germany Gula, if he is absent from the meeting, he can expect that the decision of the meeting may not be implemented within the blood family, and the "abbreviation of the abyss" Natravos is only a legendary second-order magician, but he is an ancient magical empire. The blood experiment set is a great success, transforming his own body into a demon king. The actual combat power is not worse than the legendary third-order magician. It is one of the core members of the Dark Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the transformation of Natravos after the "Devil King" seems to become more cruel and bloodthirsty, and more self-abuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus has not yet answered, a dull and low voice came from the valley: "The absence of the Rhine will not affect the decision of the blood family, if Natravos is Being late is equivalent to giving up your rights. You only need to finally choose the results you want according to our notification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in a tuxedo looks like Slowly but a few hundred meters walked to the front of the "conference hall", he is a very mature middle-aged gentleman, two beards trimmed neatly, a pair of deep red eyes around the "meeting place" circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his appearance, the entire "meeting place" became dark again, as if the light was sucked away by him, and his inner black cloak around the cloak There are seemingly dark distortions that seem to hide humans, dragons, elves, villas, towers and other different things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blood king prince "night dominates" Dracula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula looked around the mighty of all the dark worlds, his eyes paused slightly on Lucien’s face, then raised his head proudly, majestic and low. : "The blood family has reached an agreement with the dragon family and will form a new dark parliament. It is no longer a loose alliance, but a unified external whole. Now is the time when you make a decision, whether you are willing to join, if you are not willing , then please leave here.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attitude is so arrogant, it is not like discussing things, but in the notice decision, you only choose to accept or not accept Right, and he does not seem to worry about pushing away other legendary powerhouses in the Dark Council, perhaps in his eyes, there are not many of them, and they are few.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; However, Dracula is arrogant and arrogant, but the preparation of the matter is not ambiguous. When the blood and the dragon are united as one, he has an overwhelming advantage and can completely jump out of the dark council. Alliance re-establishes a Force, and, although the number of legendary strongmen is only a little more than half, but concentrated two legendary peaks, several legendary third-order, plus internal consistency, "no" guilt, the overall combat power is higher than the current dark parliament Quite a lot!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula’s crimson eyes once again looked at them coldly: “After the establishment of the new Dark Parliament, the dark mountains will be the main sphere of influence. Anyone who does not belong to us will be attacked. Of course, if you hide too well, We have no way.” Many places in the Dark Mountains are too dangerous, and Dracula does not guarantee that he knows every secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his words, the atmosphere suddenly solidified, and the feeling of wind and rain before the arrival of Lucien appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too arrogant, it’s too arrogant! We are legendary strong, not your vampire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big deal is to leave the dark mountains, go to the depths of the North, and go to other forces that are willing to accept us! Where can the legendary strongman not survive? Not good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most calm of Stanislas. He has long been secretly linked to the Magic Council. If he has always been afraid of the Arcane, he has already gone to Aringe. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and glanced at the "King of the Nightmare", and thanked Dracula for waiting for him to help Stanis resolve and thank him for his help. The Magic Council won a legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucien told the "King of Nightmare", whether the Dark Council can be integrated successfully, the Parliament does not matter, anyway, there is not much difference, now, Lucien However, he admits that he has made a mistake and is sincerely happy. According to Dracula and Danisos, this matter is of great benefit to the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, are the two epic knights fighting for it too? There are many rich islands in the parliament, and there is no shortage of people to guard the seas and seas. Eyes and wolves can also be contacted to see if they are willing to go to the strength of the parliament to conduct research work, hey, be studied...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, success is possible Not too big, because the spirits, the eye, and the like may not be willing to leave the dark mountains that best suit their survival and development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lucien is thinking about this, the legendary powers of the dark world are thinking about their future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if the Magic Council is fully supportive of Dracula. In that case, the situation is very unfavorable to us..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the choice is also a lot less..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way of thinking communicates in the void, basically reaching the purpose of Fitia, As long as she came to the venue with Lucien, not to say what Sien said, it would be used as an excuse, and it would be regarded as a magical parliament to intervene in this matter, and stood on the side of Dracula, unless Lucien directly attacked Degu. Pull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in normal circumstances, according to Lucian’s cautious personality, he is unlikely to be shot, and when the legendary strongmen make a choice, they will misjudge the situation. The result is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the atmosphere of the venue was changed. Lucien suddenly understood the intention of Fythia, and could not help but sigh, every legendary magician, as long as it would not I became a sorcerer and other infested by the death of the sorcerer, not infected by the negative abyss, etc., all of whom are known as IQ, and Dubnaar idiots, also invited themselves to come - even Dubbo Nal showed off his invitation to Lucien, and other legendary powers would not believe that the Magic Council colluded with the werewolf, because the image of Dubnaar has been shaped in their eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Lucien planned to speak out without hesitation, the "head of the elders" of the octopus’s head stood up, and the eight tentacles were drifting without wind: "Prince Dracula, you replaced the whole blood group." The decision, 'The Ear of Silver Eyes' knows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the "observer" does not know, it means that half of the blood family may not be willing to unite with the dragon, The attitude of the "God of the Silver Moon" is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Rhine is a mystery, and it can't be linked. This important thing can't wait for him anymore. Now, the three first-generation princes of the blood family, as well as the Presbyterians. Members, they all agree.” Dracula’s face has been pale, as if he had not seen the sun for decades, but his mouth was strangely blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "main brain" thought in the "brain of the elders" was slightly surprised, and even the priest Sett, who had the best "observer", agreed. Dracula's proposal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
