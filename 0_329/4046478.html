			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas's half-face magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the latest issue of "Arcane", Alti laughed and laughed: "Sure enough, it was confirmed! Unfortunately, I was not in Brooke at the time." In the lab, I didn't see his expression, I must be very surprised. It must be desperate! What is a pity is that he did not directly recognize the collapse of the world like Roland's idiot, otherwise I would wake up dreaming!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy, ecstatic, he does not hide his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman felt that Altty’s arrogance was mad, and he couldn’t help but cough twice. It’s worth mentioning Alti尓, who has the title of “mad dog”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is a little pale, it seems that after using Douglas's laboratory to verify the conclusions of the journal, the soul is not traumatized - in order to find a mysterious space, the legendary magic of the parliament The teachers are all going all out, often going out, so although Douglas is very concerned about the verification of the light quantum hypothesis, the speed of improving the magic array is no more than Roland, but after seeing the experimental design provided by the "Arcane" journal, he only used it. The final renovation was completed in just half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Luciaana with a smile, many years of depression finally burst out, feeling more joy than ever, but with her surname, can not do Al Titan is so arrogant: "Lu Xien? Evans is the youngest generation who is the most promising to become a great Arcanist. His light quantum hypothesis is really from the perspective of our particle theory proponents. I like quantum hypothesis. Maybe the world is really not continuous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if continuation, what about calculus?" Altty looked at Lucia with hatred Na, yelling at her, although he has given 50,000 arcane points to Lucien, and he was used by Lu Xien to repay the borrowing of the storm, but it does not mean that he completely accepted the quantum hypothesis, in his view This is just a variant of particle theory. It has nothing to do with the world's discontinuity. "The quantum hypothesis must have something wrong. It must be changed. Even if Lucien is standing in front of me, I will say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rucciana is just expressing The mood of his own joy, the words are "some", "maybe" as a prefix, but was hated by Alti, so his face is slightly gloomy, secretly said: "mad dog!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti尓 did not care about the attitude of Norman and Luciana, picked up an intelligence reading, and then gave a sullen laugh: "Roland, Collester... a big Master, three high-level magicians, twenty-seven mid-level magicians, and more cognitive world broken coagulators, this damn wave of supporters finally got the ending! They showed off victory At that time, did you expect that there will be today? When Brooke stepped on the throne of the Arcanist with his bloody brains, did he ever think that he would also know that the world is broken and solidified?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of grievances in his heart seems to be deeper than everyone imagined, even if it is also a particle theory supporter, Luqiana also frowned, is a mage of the parliament, and has died, Is it necessary to use such a curse to make a mad tone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman’s face has already emerged from anger, and he has to argue with Alti, but his expression is stiff and respectful: "Teacher."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has walked down the upper level of the Magic Tower. He frowned slightly at Alti: "Attention to the grace, the double-slit interference of light, etc. can not be explained by the light quantum hypothesis, we We must be humble and cautious, and those who die on our magical roads may have disputes, but they are consistent and external, and together we will strengthen the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, teacher." Alti sighed with a smile. "This time thanks to Lucien Evans, but unfortunately he couldn't directly complete the exact experiment three years ago. I don't know what he is going to be now? What are you studying?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I heard that Lucien Evans is mimicking the storm to dominate your particle bombardment.” Norman is a member of the Panel. Member, the Magic Engineering Department belongs to his scope, so magic Committee to study the mobilization of high-order magician Lucien transformation of matter atom Institute he understood more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers: "Fernando came with Lucien, he is probably studying something, you will know when you ask. Norman, if you are in your heart If you are not feeling well, just go back and don't force yourself to see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman looks a little dazed: "In any case, the experimental results show everything."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has accumulated a lot of problems in improving her own "spiritual particle meditation" using the light quantum hypothesis. Some of them can be consulted by the teacher Douglas, while others are best discussed with the light quantum hypothesis presenter, which helps even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti's expression is excited: "I have to ask him if there is any other way of subverting the fluctuations and saying that we must chase after the victory Overthrow!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also sent most of the mid-level magicians in the parliament to hell? Ruciana looked at Alti and she didn't like such radical things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Lucien, wearing a black double-breasted long dress and a monocle, followed the storm and walked into the small living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have results? Need help?" Douglas saw the thick papers held by the storm in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando flew the paper directly to Douglas: "Luxien's 'New Alchemy', see for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;################################################################################################################# <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sees Fernando’s performance, and Ci’s face converges, starting with his unique and thoughtful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading, Douglas opened his mouth and raised his right hand. It seemed to use gestures to strengthen his tone, but he forced it and continued reading. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and two hours have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti尓, Norman, etc. Although it is often two or three days in an experiment, it is quite tormenting to wait for nothing, and in order not to disturb Douglas, they I dare not speak, and even the magic of secret communication, mind connection, etc. are not used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ancient magical empire was destroyed, Douglas was already a great mage, and he was deeply influenced by the past in the relationship between the teacher and the student. He could care for the students in close proximity to him. Students must maintain a meticulous respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas placed the paper on the walnut table next to it, closed his eyes, and pondered for half an hour, seeming to simulate something in his cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, we were always accused by the church of being the glory of the gods, trying to step into the forbidden zone of the gods, but we all know that we just stripped off some things. The sacred coat is still far from their accusation, but now, from the theoretical system of your thesis, I seem to have stood before the restricted area of ​​the gods, just waiting for the experiment to confirm to open the door. This time, we can be innocent The church’s accusation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas said solemnly, “But everything must be based on experimental results, and your theoretical system must wait until the 'neutron’ is discovered. High energy bombardment changes the elements and so on. When your predictions are realized one by one, you can get a complete evaluation. This is the stage that every big arcumist after I put forward the theoretical system."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the emergence of the title of the Great Arcanist after his theoretical system is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking, Douglas’s expression is slightly excited, what is the reality close to the world? What is the mystery of discovering magic? This is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority of creation is one of the highest pursuits of the magician, never as close as it is today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If human beings can do what the gods can do, then what is the value and significance of the existence of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Great Arcanist? God's Forbidden Zone?" Alti asked sharply and excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at Fernando and saw him nod gently, so he didn’t keep his students secret again. Anyway, Lucien is about to submit a paper: “Luxien’s The new alchemy, the theoretical system of 'seeing the mysteries of matter and controlling the authority of creation', is a theoretical system that can change the times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Norman The mouth is slightly open, I can't believe there will be such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
