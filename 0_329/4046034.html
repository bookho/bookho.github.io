			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the early morning, Lucien went through many magic experiments and finally learned and mastered the "Star of the Stars", "Frost Rays", " Five informal magics, such as the Forbidden Light, the Master's Hand, and the Acid Splash. As for yesterday, I learned and tried the "out of control loop" without spells. Lucien will stabilize the cast time. It took about three seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the witch’s own record, Lucien found that he analyzed the magic, learned the magic, and mastered the magic time, which was a little bit amazing, except that the witch did not understand, forcibly Master the "out of control ring", she is good at the elemental magic "acid splash", "frost ray", usually three to four days, twenty hours, hundreds of magic experiments plus cast practice before parsing and Master, and Lucien, "acid splash" used five times, "frost ray" used seven times, "Star of the eye" used ten times, only "forbidden light" due to prior analysis and understanding is not enough It took only 30 times to master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lucine’s view, this mainly lies in the fact that the spell structure seems to be based on a mathematical model, and then integrates his own understanding of the magic construction process, and informally The magic model structure is just a simple rune graph, which is equivalent to the degree of the initial and high school plane geometry of the six-pointed star. After reviewing the literature in the library, most of the informal magic analysis becomes very simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the understanding of the magical construction process, Lucien also relies on past knowledge, such as the "acid splash" is understood to use sulfur to produce sulfuric acid, but When it comes to the ban on light, Lucien can't rely on the previous knowledge to understand it. It can only be said that the structure of the reverse-shocking "fluorescent grass" can let it absorb light without reflection, and the effect is not bad. Not good, many exercises are mastered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Lucien self-reflection: "You can't rely too much on past knowledge. The magic of this world should have its own unique place, although some can be combined with physics and chemistry. Knowledge, but the other has to be resolved slowly. After all, the elements and rules of the world are likely to be different from the earth, such as the plagiarism, such as the precious silver and fine gold recorded by the witch, such as why it can rely on astrology. "Truth, good fortune, etc.".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the "out of control loop", because Lucien fully understands that it is magic under gravity, it can be so fast Reduce the cast time to the current limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After restoring his mentality with a quiet break of ten minutes, Lucien began to simply deal with traces left behind, such as the surface of corroded stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of informal magic is really not strong enough. Frost rays can only kill the heart and throat, causing sudden cardiac arrest and suffocation. An adult, otherwise it will hit all the frost ray. If it is only a little bit, at most, people will suffer severe frostbite, and the movement and thinking will become slow. The acid splash will also be due to the acid concentration and strength. It’s the key to hitting.” Lucien calmly analyzes his apprenticeship magic, and there is not much disappointment. Although many magics don’t look strong, as long as they are used well, the effect is equally amazing on specific occasions and at specific times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the traces, Lucien put the casting materials in his pockets in a hidden and convenient way, and then did not return to the ground, but continued to the sewers by the poor. Explore the direction of the district outlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because Lucien has considered that in order to find black diced mushrooms, it is necessary to find the carrion first, and it is very likely that the cemetery will be secretly monitored by the church. Next, in addition to the dead beasts and humans in the Black Forest of Metzer, the sewer is the only place where there is hope to find carrion. After all, many poor people and beggars living here do not necessarily have shrouds. Friends and relatives who do not know are around, do not rule out the possibility of quietly dying in the depths of the sewers. It is even rarer to see dead animals and rotten meat pieces that have been thrown into the sewers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the witch also explored in the sewers, originally for the black nectar, and later to find the origin of the red-eyed mouse, but did not encounter danger, so Lucien dared to explore this sewer first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit is scattered, faintly inductive around, Lucy En walked cautiously in the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these more than 20 minutes, Lucien has explored several places and found three carrion, two mice and a strange one. Jelly-shaped animals, but unfortunately there is no black corpse mushroom growing on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sewer in this section is very wide, with a quiet stream in the middle, a dark river with some rubbish, it will flow all the way to the water outlet, into the Belém River, on the stone ramps on both sides, each with a row of rags Things, such as earthen jars, and several beggars whose clothes are rotted to reveal a lot of skin are gathering on one side of the road and don't know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw that he was only a beggar, he did not evade, and he had already been discovered, so he steadily tried to pass through the other side of the ramp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people, the sewer is not where you should come, what purpose do you have?" The group of beggars stood up and looked like they were in their 60s. The old man with ribs protruding and dry up can hear his voice, but he is about forty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not pipe Xien wearing a linen jacket and then dilapidated, cheap, and then unable to conceal the identity of the poor, compared with these beggars, it is gorgeous Like the nobility, at least it won't rot to the point where most of the skin is exposed, at least it is very clean, so the old man recognizes that Lucien is not the "indigenous people" of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and replied: "I have a friend who lives in the sewer. I came to him." The words are confident and full of words. The beggars are in the eye, because in this dark sewer without law, in order not to trigger the greed of these beggars, it is the best way to behave in a strong manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the thin old man, several other beggars stood up, staring fiercely and greedily at Lucian, but Lucien showed no weakness. Looking around them, they showed their solid body and the dagger that faintly emits cold light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made them subconsciously avoid the eyes of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lucien step by step, the old man suddenly smiled: "Young people, I see you are not dressed well, and in the hands There is another dagger, and it seems to be a less legitimate thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was a little surprised that he would talk to himself, thinking about it, coldly Answer: "This has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognac old man smiled and said: "No matter what, you can see that you have a hard time. Since you are working so hard, Young people who are so hard can't eat white bread and beef every day. I don't think it's your fault. The truth teaches us that everyone is the Lord's Lamb, but why the nobles can live a luxurious life. Devoted to his poor people, but can not change the fate, everyone is born with sin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not interested in what you said, you do not want I talked to me again." Lucien was cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this cognac old man is very concealed and does not leave a handle, it is unclear to change others, but from his words, Lucien is I smelled a familiar taste, that is, the taste of being preached, and from his point of view, it is certainly not the truth of the gods. As for other gods, or the devil, Lucien is not interested in the moment, not enough strength. In the case of rushing to contact these, it is a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not let him talk too much, because the more you know, the less you can leave, the other sects spread under the control of the Truth It is a crime of absolutely getting into the fire, and these beggars will not risk losing the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognac old man and several beggars did not expect Lucien to refuse to be so simple and direct, and could not help but stare at Lucien, like I was deprived of precious things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to try my dagger?" Lucien shakes his dagger and walks calmly and steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were interlaced with them through the sewers, Lucien was keenly aware that there was a clean black cloth in the place where they had been around. There is a curved corner with a silvery glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking old man recalled what he said and felt that he didn’t reveal anything, just like a common poor complain, just focusing on the nobility Only on the body, he also measured the age, physical state, and the dagger in his hand, so he reluctantly sat down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the beggars and walk through the sewers for more than ten Minutes, the sound of the water in Lucien’s ear suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
