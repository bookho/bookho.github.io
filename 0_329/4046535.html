			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler City, the headquarters of the Pale White, in a dark, towering magic tower, after all the "big cracking" and "elemental decomposition" destruction, Fernando and Hathaway found the entrance to Congos's half-faced "dirty land" according to Bergner's astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s a repetitive movement, and the two Arcans added a prophet for more than an hour without the master’s control. In the face of most of the defenses, only the half-god lich was placed in the chamber of the talisman, and a black box with a variety of precious stones was seen, which sensed the flame of the beating inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the 'desperate abyss' enchantment." Bergner reminded Fernando and Hathaway, let them be careful to be countered, the demigod lich used to guard How can the magical array of your own amulet not be hidden? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando directly used the "electromagnetic storm" to distort the surrounding space, and isolated the last point of the magical array and the control center. Hathaway used "luxury lifting" Begin to forcibly crack the enchantment, they have no time and no patience to slowly resolve the "guessing", destroy the defense with the least cost, in order to fight for time to save people, to bear part of the counter-attack, and suffered serious injuries within acceptable limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layer of magical array was lifted and broken, and the secret chamber became a place of abyss, and a powerful counter-attack was about to erupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Fernando, Hathaway, and Bergner raised their heads inductively, gazing through the transparent barriers and looking at the black talisman. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space above the fate suddenly distort and blur, and a scene of infinite ray bursts emerges. The golden skull screams and dissolves in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of destruction, even if separated by the "desperate abyss", Fernando, Hathaway and other three seem to be able to feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid disappearance of the golden skull, the projection of this scene has also become blurred, and the "angle of view" is getting farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three legendary magicians suddenly saw that in the mountains, where the light broke, a strange orange-red "mushroom" cloud rose. It is so big that it covers almost half of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of shock waves radiated outward, rolling up the dust, making the "mushroom" seem top-heavy, very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "mushroom" after impressing Fernando, Hathaway and Begner, disappeared without a trace of the scene projection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of this explosion is close to the blow of the speaker's full force." Recalling the sight that he had just witnessed, Begner made a judgment and looked at the sea. Sewei, seems to be asking her the authority of this elemental field, "it looks like a simple explosion of magic. In general, the power of this kind of magic can be improved. I don't know if I can finally reach the level of God's descending surgery." <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei looked at the front quietly, as if thinking about something, and like organizing words: "I feel that this explosion is related to the mystery of the sun. To what extent, there is no actual arcane theory and magical configuration, I can't judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is Congers fighting with?" Fernando Frowning, "The mystery of the sun is still related to Lucien, but what he uses to give this level of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Unreal When the sun rises, Fernando feels likely to be related to Lucien, Congers This scene appeared again when he was on the road to Sean. He naturally linked the two together. However, he did not think that Lucien could upgrade to the legendary peak, even if the previous research had gained, and he understood the mystery of the sun and got the legend. The model of the spell, the strength has to be advanced step by step, so directly suspected that Lucien is using some kind of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black jewels of all kinds of rare magical gems begin to bloom in different brilliance, absorb other substances around, and begin to reshape a golden The skull, while Fernando and Hathaway looked at each other, speeded up the cracking of the "desperate abyss". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nearly an hour, the golden skull was reshaped, and Congus awakened from the darkness, and the scene of the sun’s ray of light seemed to remain in his In sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Moon has long since recovered, and has been waiting for an opportunity. It is still alive to come back." Congers thought with some fear that his soul was still gestating in the golden skull and had not sensed the surrounding scenes. "And, What kind of magic does Lucien Evans use? How can it be so horrible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he just took a moment to look at it, he can judge silver moon by experience. Aitna lent her power to Lucien and let him cast magic. If the magic itself belongs to Aitna, he does not need to be so troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many secrets does this kid still hide?" The more the Congers chased Lucien, the more shocking he was, but he quickly converged his thoughts. Thinking about the next plan, "Silver moon recovery, chasing will become chased, but the mysterious existence of the mysterious existence of the dead spirit is obliterated by Lucien's 'legendary magic' along with my body. It’s really hard work, and I’ve sent a ring!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very happy with the legendary ring he has made and has always regarded it as an artifact. ——Although in order to improve the success rate of refining this ring, he chose the most good field of necromancer, and based on his own legendary career, so many abilities overlap with themselves, but this does not prevent him from being the only one. The fact that the legendary item was made is a masterpiece that makes him proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two little mice of Lucien and Natasha did not die, I can no longer risk being in the parliament, is the group of guys joining the Necromancer, or Hiding in the dark mountains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of discretion, Congus made up his mind to prepare to enter the realm of the dead, he gnashed his teeth: "There will be opportunities in the future." I will surely fulfill my promise and make your two little mice a corpse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the soul power recovered, the golden skull of Congers Floating up, the eyeballs turned back to the original needle-shaped red awns, it is necessary to go to the nearest dead spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" He was shocked to see the Fernando, Hathaway and Begner on his own, feeling the storm dominates the emotions of suppressing terror, so he quickly said : "Lu Xien is not dead, Natasha is not dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very worried that the old metamorphosis of the storm will turn the roar into an attack. I wiped it out together with the talisman, and the strength returned to the original level, and even half of it has not recovered, I can't resist Fernando, let alone the expressionless Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should die too!" Fernando growled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers calmed down and looked at the prophet of the parliament: "Begner, my conspiracy to kill the high-ranking magician of the parliament is my fault, It is also my fault to conceal the secret and privately search for the existence of Yinyue Etna and the spirits. It should be punished and warn other magicians in the parliament. However, Lucien Evans is not dead. Please pay attention to the standard of punishment, and I Asked to hold a meeting of the highest scrutiny team, and all members will discuss it to decide the punishment for me. This is the treatment that a legendary magician deserves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council only Eighteen legends, the most powerful church is only twenty or thirty. Legend is the highest-end force. It is the foundation for one's forces to survive. For every organization, losing any legend is huge. Going back, so Congos is qualified and has the conviction to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begner, who focused on the development of the Magic Council, nodded to Fernando and Hathaway: "Congers violated the law of the Parliament this time. I almost killed a high-ranking magician and made a big mistake, but it was almost, Lucien Evans was still alive, so Congos’s crimes have not yet reached the point where he needs to be killed.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And a legendary role, I believe that both of you are very clear, just make a punishment, such as the witness of the magic source, Congers It is enough to make a vow to both of you or Lucien Evans, to make a promise that no longer hurts, to give a lot of compensation, and to act as the executor of several plans for the parliament to explore dangerous areas." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high-level magician who chased the parliament without hesitation, this is a serious provocation to the order of the parliament, if even such behavior does not get people Vigilant disciplinary, I think all the magicians in the parliament will be in danger, no cohesiveness Introduction. Compared to such consequences, the loss of a legendary magician is not unacceptable. "Storm dominate suppress their anger, even express their own reasons, but also as roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers still looks at Bergner: "But Lucien Evans is not dead, he has virtually no loss, is it a Is the high-level magician important and a legendary magician important? Although he is likely to become a great arcian in the next few years, it is only possible that his new alchemy system has not been confirmed! To help him vent a little anger, Want to degenerate a legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
