			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was in the same place, Lazar almost hit his back, but he responded in time: "What happened?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vase has a curse." Lucien had no time to identify, picking Lazar's easiest way to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Curse!" Lazar's voice became high and he couldn't understand Lucien's unhurried, calm and calm attitude, and seemed to be faint. Still a little excited? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery is on, Lucien! This is killing you with a curse! How do you seem to be talking about today's weather?" Lazar took a road Sean left from the side of the vase, sure and sure that he saw Lucien's eyes pass by a ray of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien converges on his excitement, stops the saliva that seems to flow quickly, makes himself behave like a victim, and the voice suppresses anger: "Lazar , close the Atomic Research Institute, do not let anyone go out, concentrate all the gifts received during this time, I report to the Panel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! "Lazar usually looks hippie smile, optimistic and enthusiasm, but the key moment is never embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lazare leaves, the blockade magic circle is opened, and all the gifts received by the magicians and apprentices such as Rock and Annick are placed in small conference rooms. Lu Xien carefully carefully looked at this elegant vase. Since it caused the electronic induction in the cognitive world in a close range, it means that it is probably a beta ray (also an electron flow), so the surname element May be the biggest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien long ago searched for dozens of elements that have been found in the dozens of elements that are sufficiently strong, after all, regardless of the nuclear bombs most familiar to the people of the Earth, Or a variety of other uses, are inseparable from such elements, but even if many unstable isotopes have radioactive surnames, none of them meet the requirements of Lucien, until today, they were "cursed" and had a windfall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without delay, Lucien pushed the monocle worn by the left eye: "Soup, I found a curse in my study." The vase, suspected to be the assassination of the church, sent someone to investigate as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am currently outside, let the investigators of the corrections department come over, I will get back as soon as possible. "A reviewing committee member, the most promising high-level arcane master was assassinated by a curse. It was a very bad incident, and it was still his own classmate. Even if he had just submitted his paper, Tang Pei gave up without any hesitation. The thing at hand, return directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the parliamentary headquarters, less than three minutes, the investigators of the corrections department entered the atomic institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five investigators coming, led by a middle-aged man with brown curly hair and dark skin, and a black scepter badge with a disciplinary part on his chest. ", four silver stars' arcade badges, six black ring magic badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comment of Evans, I am the deputy of the Correctional Department, Berak, and now the disciplinary disciplinary department, accepting the orders of the Commissioner to investigate the curse." Skin Dark, as if it were the Pali Principality and the southern desert of the Kingdom of Buriana, Bellak was extremely dignified and serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Discipline does not have a minister. There are only 12 deputy ministers whose arcane rank is not high and whose magic level is in the 7th or 8th ring, directly led by the Panel. Therefore, even if Barack is a high-ranking magician, he can only become a deacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien let Rock and other magicians and apprentices gather in one office, and another investigator asks that they and Lazar take Bellak Into the small meeting room, pointing to the vase in the previous room: "Bellak, this vase has a curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellak released the check magic, vase There was no reaction on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem?" Bellak said, while inspiring a magical item on his body, there was a pale green glow on the vase, but still no reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously changing the inspection magic of several different levels and fields, Bellak did not find it at all, and turned his head to look at Lucien: "Evans Commissioner, After my inspection, there is no curse. Or do you have any special inspection magic? Can you provoke the curse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have the magic, but I can use a magical array in the lab to check out a ray." Lucien explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berk did not directly believe: "Can you demonstrate it? Commissioner Evans, as an investigator, must verify every detail."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Lucien asked Barack to take the vase and other items containing "curse" that he had sensed into the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, is this not a cathode ray? No, the energy seems to be much higher!" Seeing the familiar reactions and surnames, Lazar was unable to restrain himself. The land broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he suddenly realized: "No wonder Lucine, you can detect the curse, the rays that come into contact every day are always familiar!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not too exaggerated. For a magician who changes the soul, the spiritual power, and the cognitive world, the long-term contact with something and knows its special name is very It's easy to be familiar with it, but this familiarity is clearer in the high-level magicians who are initially substantive in the cognitive world, because the mapping of things in the cognitive world enhances the induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what does this have to do with the curse? Isn't this a new particle that you found by Evans?" Bellak still doesn't believe it is a "curse," Maybe the vase material is special and can freely emit electrons. I think you may be too sensitive, just a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I insist that it is a curse, My Star of Destiny feels dangerous.‚Äù Lucian pushed the problem to the Star of Destiny and Astrology, and no one knew his strength in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belac took out the record book: "I will ask the Panel to send a curse to the high-level magician or Archmage to help confirm, Evans Commissioner, please be patient Wait, rest assured, even if we can't confirm, we will investigate the origin of the vase and will not delay the time to trace the clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an Arcane Review Committee The treatment that should be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Lucien and Lazar and Barak returned to the small meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fear of cursing, Barak did not let the two go in, but he went to other investigators to see what was asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of material is the vase, can you launch the 'cathode ray' on its own?" Lazar was funny and puzzled. "I knew this material, we Why bother to use gas discharge to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien squinted: "Probably a special material, hope not to be cursed, Assassination once has a bit of gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder I thought you were very excited before, Lucien, your side of greed is getting worse and worse, someday you It will become like a dragon." Lazar suddenly realized that he was stalking Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien glanced at him with a contemptuous look: "That's the real dragon you haven't seen."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than ten minutes, after several investigators initially arranged the inquiry transcripts, the Atomic Research Institute's door opened without warning, and the soup accompanied a tall and thin old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man's face is ordinary, his hair is covered by a hood, and the black magic robe is not a touch of variegation, like the darkest night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of the Cursed Eyes?" Lucien recognized him as the "cursed eye" of Atlante, Atlante? Forman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not returned to Calais, I am going to stay at the headquarters for a while, listening to Fernando saying that you have encountered a strange curse event, so come and see. Collect various The eccentric curse is my hobby.‚Äù Atlante‚Äôs voice is soft and soft, and people‚Äôs ‚Äúheart‚Äù doubts disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you, you." In the face of the "curse of the eyes" that left all kinds of weird legends, Lucien even used to be legendary. There is also a kind of fear from the heart that rises in fear and chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante nodded leisurely, slowly stopped before the vase, paused for a few seconds, he suddenly opened his eyes, the whole vase slammed A layer of green color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
