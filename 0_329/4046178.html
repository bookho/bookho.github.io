			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days later, the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astall listened intently to Lucien’s explanation, and his left hand gently stroked the neck of Mercedes’s tiger-skin cat to make it comfortable. Kneeling at the table, yawning lazily from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien finished, Astar retracted his left hand and applauded gently: "Yes, very good, just seven days, Evans, you will The axioms and theorems of the first part of "The Foundation of Magical Geometry" can be skillfully derived and applied, and are also associated with constructing graphics, sketching magic traps, etc. This speed indicates your potential in arcaneism, even throughout the parliament. It is also an outstanding rank. I am very satisfied with this, and I will give you the idea of ​​Brooke in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, As it is about to leave in the middle of the night tonight, Astar is a question about the basics of several arcanes. Lu Xien, Lu Xien naturally answered accurately and smoothly, without any mistakes, won his appreciation and praise. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slightly: "Thank you Mr. Astar for your kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Properly demonstrating your "natural talent" and "potential" in arcane and mental power helps to conceal the problem that your strength may progress rapidly in the future. If you are low-key Tibetan mastiffs, when you are no better than those magical geniuses, if you are promoted to middle or high-level, it will lead to doubts, causing many unnecessary troubles or trying to cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astra in front of the shadow of a white paper and a quill, so floating in the air. He crossed his hands and folded: "Evans's potential in the arcane is unquestionable, so I won't examine your ability to guide the arcane and magical foundations. Oh, a profound arcane master, a powerful magic. Teacher, may not be a good teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He writes very fast, the voice just falls, the feather pen floating on the table stops, densely A white sheet full of pages flew to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time when Lucien looked at this meditation carefully, Astal continued: "This is the great arcane master Brooke based on the theory of mental fluctuations. Improved meditation, suitable for the meditation environment of most factions, including the starry sky meditation environment and the four elements of the meditation environment of the elements, to quickly enhance the soul and spiritual power in the low-order, but after the middle stage There is no such obvious effect. Of course, you will need to change other high-level meditation ideas at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not make any request, just for one The emotional investment of the potential magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual strength of Brooke’s Thoughts is to be close to the concept of “spiritual wave”. The theory is complex but simple to use. It is suitable for formal magicians, so Lucien has a lot of experience after reading it again, and is ready to try it when he is quiet tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If its effect is as good as what Astal and Felipe said, you won’t have to wait a year to become a second-ring magician. As long as the knowledge is sufficient, you can parse and construct the two-ring magic, which can be advanced in one to two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Astar, we are going to go to Holm Kingdom tonight, go to Allinge, I have some questions to ask you." Lucien burned the paper with the meditation in his hand and looked at Astal sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astar Wenwen smiled: "Evans, do you want to ask about the general situation of the parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, Mr. Astar, unknown and strangers are always scary, and I am about to become a member of the parliament. Of course, I am very concerned about the general situation of the parliament, such as the difference between the arcian and the magician, the parliament What kind of organization, the current magic is divided into which factions, how many legendary magicians, how many big arcans, and so on." Lu Xien said a lot of problems accumulated in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astall smiled with amazement: "It’s irresponsible to introduce the magician you came to, and didn’t say anything. Then I simply Speaking of it, since the speaker proposed the concept of arcane, gradually there is the emergence of the level of arcane, also divided into one to nine grades, by publishing papers on arcane and magic research, creating and improving magic, The new magic potion formula, the number of times the research results are cited, etc., is increased by the Arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the level of arcane does not seem to be of any use, but from the experience of hundreds of years, unless the ancient magician relies on various materials and rituals to madly upgrade and transform the soul, spiritual path, a magician's arcane level Basically, it determines the upper limit of the strength that he can reach. For example, I am a five-level arcane master, which means that my current level of knowledge is far from reaching the level of the Master, at most high-level magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Therefore, within the association, the level of arcane is more valued and more respectable than the level of magic. Oh, of course, because the level of magic represents its own strength, No one will discriminate against a gentleman with a high level of magic and a low level of Arcane, which is likely to be smothered by all kinds of strange magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard Relished, then curiously asked: "Is the Arcanist above the Arcanist? How many Arcanists are there in Parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Arcane Master is An honorary title, only made in the field of magic The theoretical contribution of magic and the development of the era can be awarded this title. However, the dignitaries who obtained this title are either legendary magicians themselves, or it is not long before they become legendary magicians with the full support of the parliament, and In the field of legendary magic, they have a higher arcane division title. They can grow faster than ordinary legendary magicians. It seems that there are not too many advanced obstacles, so the big arcane title represents the most powerful legendary magician, even if it is not now. And in the future it must be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astar is very respectful and respectful to the Arcane Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw Lucien’s curious eyes, whispering: “There are only seven lords in the entire parliament with the title of Archer.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creator, founder, perfection of the Arcane and Modern Magic System, one of the founders of calculus, the Speaker of the Parliament, the 'Arcane Emperor', 'Magic Voter' Lord Derrick Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The founder, perfection of the electromagnetism magic, the definition of the 'field', 'the poetry of the goddess' Edwin? Lord Brooke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient magical empire describes the essence of magic as a goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are both the peak powers of the legendary magic field, the great people who can dominate the whole world, only the difference between the popes who can rely on the power of 'God' A little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rest, there is a 'destroyed hand' Oliver that redefines the four elements and associates them with force magic and electromagnetic magic? Lord Constantine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the founders of calculus, redefining and categorizing the elements, explaining most of the elements of magic, and found out The 'Elemental Dominator' of 17 elements other than the common elements, Yale Blue? Hathaway? Hofberger. Although her legendary occupation is an ancient name, it is essentially different."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading the concept of hot and cold to create the 'storm master' of the thermal system magic, Lord Fernando Balesta."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The discoverer of the law of conservation of energy, the perfection of calculus, 'Iceland Witch' Helen Parry You, her legendary occupation is also very different from the ancient name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cracking some of the mysteries of the soul, the initial study of human body into the small field' The soul of the dead dominates 'Hisente Miranda'" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astall simply introduced seven great arcans, did not mention the magic they are good at, they The surnames, etc., then summed up: "At the same time they are also the most powerful seven of the 18 legendary magicians in the parliament. They do not seem to make contributions to change the magic and the development of the era. Without the title of the Great Arcanist, there is no way. Breaking through some of the obstacles in the field of legendary magic in a hundred or two years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only 18 legendary magicians in the parliament?" Lucien is subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astall laughed and said: "What is it? Only the Southern Church, not an epic knight, the legendary caster is only twenty, they are the whole The strongest organization in the world and other heterosexual spaces. Of course, there are several ancient legendary magicians who have not joined the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know enough." Lucien smiled and laughed. "The 18 legendary magicians are the highest level of the parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
