			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that the bishops preached that God loves the world, regardless of each other, and whether the believers are in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, not their identity, whether it is magic. The teacher, the vampire, as long as they sincerely believe in God, believe in God from the heart, and the behaviors shown are in line with their beliefs, then they are devout, righteous people who can be redeemed." Lucian no Speaking of Richard's horror, he talked like a scholar and sought guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not completely follow the content of "justification by faith" in the soul library, because the truth and the cross on earth only have a certain The gods in some places are not the same religion, and the interpretation of "justification by faith" is based on the savior's incarnation and saving the world. There is no such miracle in the truth. There is no such savior. Indiscriminate use will only make Richard laugh at his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien spreads the content of "justification by faith" and introduces it into the more common religious laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the question of Lucien, Richard gradually caught the surprise, the initial suspicion was the temptation of the devil or the lobbying of the magician, and the face was smashed. Smile: "So tell us that honest people are not afraid, he will be promoted to the holy house, the benevolent people are not afraid, he will board the mountain of heaven, the righteous people are not afraid, he will be favored..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the content of a passage in the Holy Scriptures. Richard took it out and said: "If the magician or vampire can come from the heart The believer and the lord are strictly in accordance with their own beliefs, then he must be pious, a righteous person who will be redeemed, and there are many examples of the vigil of the church referee, and other magicians, dark Creatures, which ones do they meet the teachings of the Holy Scriptures?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Richard, you are talking about ancient magicians, they are cruel, crazy Bloody, indeed, an unrighteous person, unable to get redemption, but most modern magicians follow The laws of the Kingdom, and not a luxury, not lust, longing for the good things, in whatever they do not meet the "canon" of the teachings? "Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard understands that the young man is not referring to the bloody battle mage, but to the arcane masters who concentrate on the experiment, even if they accept The task is basically related to the annihilation of demons, demons, dark creatures, access to resources, exploration of dangerous areas, etc., so there is no refutation from the loopholes of this sentence, but seriously: "They are doing things for the Lord every day, And they are full of lies in their dealings with the congregation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the lord's thing? Is it the mystery of studying things?" Lucien pointed to the sky "Can there be verses in the Holy Scriptures that cannot explore the world? God has warned the world not to be near his field?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard thinks carefully, It is found that there is really no relevant content in the "Sacred Code". Only the refutation and warning of the Lord against the false believers, the interfering believers, the evil ones, and the bloody people are not specific to the exploration of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has also been a disciple of El God for a while, and has seen Francis copying the teachings of the Holy Scriptures several times, and there are books in the Soul Library. Can refer to it, it is natural to know that the relatively simple core book of "The Holy Scriptures" has no such content. After the "Sacred Code" is written, the magic parliament can not find the shadow, and Douglas should also be the intermediate level. The idea of ​​exploring the world has not yet been proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is only a clear opposition to the evil human experiment in the Holy Scriptures, that humans should not explore the forbidden zone of life, and many arcans do not Good at the field of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Richard said: "He said, you must not be near me, not facing me... This means that mortals are not allowed to be close to the realm of the gods." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien underestimated the interpretation of the clergy dialogue, they can always interpret different meanings from one sentence, and sometimes do not know how to guide the topic, Go ahead with your own preset direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Richard, the old man who left his mark on his face, continued: "And the "Teaching Code" clearly stipulates that no mortal can take pictures. Into the restricted area of ​​the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Scriptures? It is not what God said, but the continual revision of the pope and some clergy, it has Authoritative surname?" Lucien heard a little relaxation, this is his own default direction of conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church in the north does not think so." Lucien carried out the teachings of the northern church, and thanked the truth for the great division of the gods and the different factions inside to provide "cannonballs". Otherwise, one and a half of the guys, Richard. This true theologian debate is self-seeking, and Lucien is not debating the doctrine, but "helping" Richard to sort out his own ideas, which is the psychological guidance of the illusion system! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refutation of the church in the north is the focus of research in the Southern Church for centuries. Richard naturally quoted the classics without any exception, retorting and listening to Lucy. En head swelled and concentrated on waiting for his "that sentence" to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...All lambs will receive redemption through the baptism, prayer, and rituals of the church through the guidance, opening, and help of the shepherds, and the head of the shepherd It’s my will...” Richard skillfully said the words that established the status of the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes lit up and immediately interrupted Richard’s words: “So we can’t justify by faith, even if our faith is pious again. The teachings that are in conformity with the Holy Scriptures must be redeemed through the church through the clergy and through the pope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Richard’s own contradiction After many years of problems, I was so naked that I didn’t know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God loves the world, but loves the shepherd more? God loves the world, but is not willing to communicate directly with everyone's heart? At the time of prayer, at home, at Is the church, the sense of the majesty of the gods different? Is it necessary to be guided by the clergyman?” Lucien seized the opportunity and broke out a series of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard wants to refute, but thinks that there are many talented pastors and bishops who read the Holy Scriptures when they prayed with their parents when they were young. Occasionally, the gods were not guided by the monasteries and clergy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is now a "combat style" that strikes away. Seeing Richard's thinking is more confusing, the voice becomes bigger and asks:<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since God does not allow mortals to explore the world, why should we modify theology and modify the theology according to the results of the Arctician's exploration of the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what caused Richard's thinking confusion in the past 20 or 30 years. He began to advocate the source of justification by faith. Although he swears to modify the "Teaching Code", the "credit" of your magician is indispensable, but he opens his mouth but does not know it. How to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I think, in fact, both the pope and the church are obstructing the individual's power and desire between the believer and the god, whether or not they can gain magic. In the presence of the Lord, they should all be equally equal, and they will fall into hell because they do not conform to the teachings of the Holy Scriptures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Asking for cumbersome rituals, asking for the church, and asking the believers to pass the clergy are all false believers who try to hinder God from loving the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who frequently follow their own Intent to modify the Holy Scriptures, the person who interprets the Holy Scriptures must be a lurking devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Richard reacted, Lucien was drunk again and again. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those clergy who say "faith, faith" to believers, but who have devote their faith, go away!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those clerics who say to the believer that 'God loves the world, God loves the world,' but tries to monopolize the mind to the path of the gods Farewell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no obstacles between believers and the Lord, only beliefs and matching beliefs do!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard looked straight at Lucian, he said everything he wanted to say but dared not to say, and more detailed, clearer, more radical . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucine finished speaking, staring at Richard did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time, Richard smiled bitterly: "The rights of clergy should indeed be regulated. The Lord gives them the magic not to let them stand on the head of the believer." But let them protect believers and guard the faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
