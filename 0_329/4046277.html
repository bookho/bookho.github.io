			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [Www.biquwo.com], this site provides you with free novels for free reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlylena is half wronged and angry half Inexplicably responding: "What does this have to do with me? Ivanovsky, are you not controlling all the people responsible for Uncle Witt's intelligence? Why did he wake up to breakfast and name it to Fedoro? Viscount?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Fedrov is the brother of Ballshak, who apparently heard about Peter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have verified that there is no information that will allow Earl Witt to make a decision to see Viscount Fedrov, and no intelligence officer is unusual. Secretly to see the action of Earl Witt. Carlylena, is the servant and the attendants you chose to say that you have missed your mouth?" Ivanovsky denied the accusation against himself, suspected to be Carlyle. Something went wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina shook her head firmly: "No, their parents and relatives are in my control, without my permission, will not reveal to Uncle Witt." Anything else in the outside world is just about the manor style, the snowstorm situation, etc., and they have completely fulfilled my requirements. Except for the intelligence personnel, no matter which knight wants to see Uncle Witt, they are excuses that Uncle Witt is uncomfortable. Need to rest and block, let them help to send letters, letters, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly encounter this unexpected change, equal status of Carlyle and Ivanovsky is subconsciously accusing each other and shirking responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes of silence, Ivanovsky helped the gold-rimmed glasses: "That may be the Earl of Viter suddenly came up with new ideas. In short, Things got a bit of a hassle, in order to prevent hidden dangers and prevent the count from leaving the legacy to Peter suddenly, we need..." He grabbed his right hand and made a gesture of pinching his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy? Here is the castle of the vines! There are several great knights here, more than twenty knights are guarding! You want to be discovered by them, then send Going to the church's firearms?!" Carlylena looked round and looked at Ivanovsky unbelievably. It’s like watching a downright madman. Her tone is very intense and full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Ural state, like the Viscount Fedrov, the aristocrat of the Count of Viter, will take his own knight to take turns to defend the castle. This is the knight's duty to the lord. During the non-war period, there must be a two-month obligation to serve the lord in one year. Similarly, this is also the opportunity for them to communicate with the lord and to communicate with other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky seems to feel that the clothes are a little tightly pulled over the neckline. Sen coldly said: "We didn't intend to kill Peter? Just before I was worried about being discovered, I wanted to be hidden. But actually? The effect of hidden hands is not good, but let Peter know and go to the church. Reporting, I almost broke things. Since things have reached this level, it is better to use the empire's consistent style of action, which is the easiest and most effective!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for the following You don't have to worry about the big knights, knights, and castle priests. Isn't there a mid-level magician, Mr. Mattaway, and that one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Liliana’s fierce reaction suddenly subsided, as if she had never seen it before. She sighed and said with a little concern: "Since you have already decided. Just do what you said, but I always feel a little surprised, the change is too sudden, too strange."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry. Carlylena, this layer, besides the servants and servants you control, is an old man who is dying to die. Although he used to be a knight But now the will is sloppy. The spirit is weak and incapable. As long as we don't make a big noise, he can't detect it. When we removed those loyal servants, he didn't discover it?"<br />< Bryan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky touched his mouth, and the anger and troubles caused by the unpreparedness were swept away and became calm again. "And Peter must think that there are so many here." The knight and the big knight guard are absolutely safe environments, and it is much harder for us to kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina’s expression changed a few times, calm Authentic: "When you kill him, you immediately destroy the body. Then let Miyaka and Nyack become the form of him and his butler and follow the caravan and then disappear halfway. Ivanovsky, you and so on must be strong enough to assassinate Peter. Don't make big jokes like Miyaka, and end up spending ten times more energy to deal with the troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Ivanovsky answered, Carlyle added: "Although Peter tried his best to hide his strength from the pace and movements, it was hard to detect his knight's rank, but when I danced with him, from him. Judging from the heartbeat, blood flow, skin sensation, etc., he is just an ordinary formal knight, good at agility and speed. This is consistent with the situation he showed when he defeated Miyaka. What needs to be worried is the two long swords on him. They should all be magic swords, one of which may even be a middle-level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She analyzes this aspect clearly and feels sharp, not like An ordinary female aristocrat who is keen on hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the description of Miyaka, it is possible to have three or four levels, but how can an ordinary formal knight even hold a medium-sized magic sword? Confronted with a big knight, a mid-level magician? Right, he also has a fourth- or fifth-level magical item that can inspire anti-death enchantment. He has a strong defense against dead and cursed magic. So assassirated by the big knight, the mid-level magician is responsible for covering up the movement and preventing the big knights below from discovering it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Ivanovsky feels Ridiculous and awkward: "What kind of adventure did Peter have in the North? Why did a knight who had just been promoted for so long had such an expensive magic sword and magical items? He was richer than me! But after tonight They belong to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina’s emotions are completely restored, and she smiles femininely: “God items belong to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their opinion, Peter’s ordinary official knight has another adventure and can get Putting a magical sword and a four- or five-level magical item is the limit, and at most there is a magical armor - he is likely to sell the oddly-smashed magic items, materials, etc. I have enough money to buy this set of equipment that suits me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discussion, Ivanovsky told Matvey, who stood quietly with his hands behind him: "Mr. Matvey, trouble you, etc. Prevent Peter from having a teleported magical item and run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In private, he is very polite to Matvey’s tone because it’s a three-ring The magician, who is good at cursing and changing, can't even get rid of other professional players, including magicians and bishops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattvi’s haze nodded: “Unfortunately, he has a magical item that triggers the anti-death enchantment, or else I will kill him with a curse. Like that one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky smiled: "Mr. Matvey, I believe in your ability. Right, you When doing these things, don't be too far away from me and continue to protect me, otherwise some people may have bad ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what Action, its own safety is also the first, but Ivanovsky said this sentence is very easy - although some of his words may be insinuating Carlyle, but the attitude is It doesn't seem to care much about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Mattvi shortly replied. Carlylena has always maintained a charming and sexy smile, and it is not affected at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain to Matteve, Ivanovsky patted the palm of his hand: "Mr. Peternov, the assassination will be given to you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark shadow of the corner, a dull voice came: "Yes, Mr. Ivanovsky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina squinted and tried to look at the corner, but there was nothing but darkness and shadow, then she asked, "Red, or shadow," Blood?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dark, Level 3.” Ivanovsky spit out two words without making too much explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina’s mature enchanting smile is slightly stiff, because it is enough to be with the sun, the shield of truth, the sword of truth, the silver moon, the vampire, the devouring monster The destruction of the behemoth, the time dragon, the devil's duke, the demon king and other beautiful top bloodlines, the "night sky" of the nine urban owners in the east of the dead, Onegin is this lineage, able to fight against a level 8 other common level Blood Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this lineage is only visible from the defensive aspect. For example, after darkening, it can immunize the mind, the spirit, and the supernatural effects related to the state of the body. Low levels of magic and magic, immune to most of the Necromancer, change the magic, immune acid, explosion, ice and most physical attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
