			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November is the winter months, and the northerly Antwerp has a steep wind and seems to be a world of ice and snow at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear, light blue Donati River passes through the city, and the garden villa of Earl of Mechelen is located on a high ground by the river, engraved on the back. There are countless embossed "Saxon Mountain Walls" overlooking the beautiful river flowing quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a classical column-like villa that complements the conservative and rigid architectural style of the Holy Hertz Empire, but with Lucien passing through the lavender The garden of the "Ice and Snow Elf" stepped into the villa hall, but found that it was extremely luxurious, with wave-like curves, broken crotch, unique structure and exquisite details to create an exaggerated sense of distance and layering. It is the lavish and cumbersome architectural form that originated in the ancient kingdom of Syria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large-scale murals on the walls and ceilings with the theme of a half-naked beauty name, combined with the statue of a strong man piled up, create an atmosphere of unrestrained beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also considered to be half an artist and a preliminary psychoanalyst, while admiring this different from the Principality of Waorit, the Kingdom of Holm, Shah The quirky contradictory architecture of the Lan Empire, while secretly assessing: "The younger generation of the Heilz Empire seems to have had a strong dissatisfaction with the old-fashioned and conservative old-fashioned atmosphere of the entire empire, and began to yearn for the romantic luxury of the ancient Syrian kingdom. Life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is a big plus for the Parliament and the Holm Kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the city of Aringe where the Magic Council is located, or the affected Kingdom of Holm, the Principality of Calais, etc., it is now showing a vigorous development trend, and the popularity of alchemy items will bring great In contrast to the changes in social structure and humanistic thinking, the younger generation of the Heilz Empire and all the nobles of the Syracuse Kingdom are almost "drunken dreams." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in this world, the winners of high-order and above are determined to win, but there is no continuous supply of backup power, high-level, legendary Unable to stay immortal, one day there will be a fault of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, born in sorrow, dying in peace..." Lucien sang an ancient saying in his heart, and then with a courtesy and elegant smile, to the banquet Host Deni? Merkel went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Borak, I thought you wouldn’t come." Dean's delicate long hair with long blond hair and a red dress on the ingenuity Cut and decorated with many cumbersome details, with a hollow pattern, a mysterious ruby ​​pin, and a thin silver chain. Seeing him, Lucien saw a "postmodernist artist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to Borak’s description, this Deny is indeed an “artist” who loves oil painting and sketching, jewelry and fashion design. Similarly, he also has many artists. The common problem, like a man, likes to regard himself as a slender and perfect "female name". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien understands that he can’t be underestimated by this Denis, who was the first younger generation of Antilfler’s younger generation to step into the ranks of the Cavaliers. The strong, now only twenty-seven years old, is already a five-level knight, and the blood of the awakening is still very fierce "thunder". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the discomfort, and gently hugged with Denny, Lucien smiled and said, "Why don't I come?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni's mouth is "smiling": "It's just an intuition. Men are rude and fragile guys. I'm worried that you can't help but clashed with Alten, but he is always Looking forward to such an opportunity, you can 'strip' you out before entering the underground palace, then he will be a lot easier, and a group of scattered sand monkeys will only surrender to the foot of his monkey king." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some convulsion in the stomach, and Lucien tried to make her smile look less rigid, without a little "fear" and laughed: "The monkey is just a monkey." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni light brown eyes looked at Lucien slightly surprised: "Bolaq, have you had any gains recently? I found that you are totally different from the previous time." I can feel your confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughs and does not speak, trying to make himself "high Unpredictable. " <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni smiled sharply: "Things seem to be very interesting, I started thinking about whether to follow them. Borak, please me, to I will help you kill Alten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...maybe Alten will have other helpers." Lucien "shows" a little joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni snorted: "Don’t be too happy, I haven’t thought about whether I should attend or not. I shouldn’t help you. My family is not dead. I am optimistic about Alten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to please me, let Lucien couldn’t help but look up at the ceiling, in fact, I really don’t need help. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn’t this my dear cousin, Borak?" The exaggerated voice came from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who had heard this voice in secret observation, turned and looked over, only to see a tall blond man wearing a gorgeous military gown holding a The tall, beautiful lady with brown hair came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military dress is light black, with a golden ribbon on the right chest and a row of medals on the left. It is covered with a white shirt and a white vest. The man is full of enthusiasm, handsome and handsome, and the lady next to him is exquisite and elegant. The light blue evening dress reveals the white powder shoulders and a dazzling milky white, seduce the eyes of most men - Deni Watching there, but his eyes are full of envy and envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looks at the blond man, smiles unchanged: "Alten, to maintain an elegant and steady aristocratic image, I don't want others to think that we are gold Members of the finch family like to yell at the banquet, there is no aristocratic demeanor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Alten gaze, these In the face of himself or the timid or angry arrogance of Borak, he dared to speak out ironically. Duda said that he was right, he really changed a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Alten squeezed a smile: "Dear cousin, it is useless to have a noble style. Our glory comes from our blood and cannot be stimulated." There is no qualification for imitating the aristocratic style, and you still don't have oil painting, don't understand music, don't play the piano, don't write poetry, don't have all the elegant art, this has the ordinary citizens on the street. What is the difference? No, there is a big difference, at least many of them will have an instrument!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak is eager to contact other noble children and participate in each All kinds of banquets, how can I study art, and after being overtaken by Alten, I was completely immersed in the training of the Cavaliers. The more I was eager to achieve the goal, the more I was ridiculed by many nobles as a rude barbarian! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien attending the banquet is just a matter of keeping Borak, not being seen by the old guys, no interest in this boring "battle game", and According to the gloomy surname that Borak developed in recent years, it is certain that the knight's strength will be concealed in order to maximize the benefits in the underground palace. Therefore, he just raised his eyebrows with a smile: "The winner is the one who can go to the end." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Dear cousin, I heard that you have recently gone to the underground black market, and you must have got some good things, so it seems so confident, but The help of external forces is always just an external force, there is no way to go further." Alten deliberately revealed that he had mastered the whereabouts of Borak and made himself look confident and majestic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he reached out and held the woman next to him: "And a woman with a vision, such as Jocelyn, would Don't hesitate to choose me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the blushing Jocelyn, Lucien suddenly had a weird idea, really a "wisdom" lady, Probably will make yourself a strong person, and then drag the man who is fancy to him back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien pondered what kind of attitude to face this situation can look like a Borak, the hall suddenly quieted down and a door appeared Wearing a white lace evening dress, like a fairy-like pure blond girl, she is not tall, elegant and lively, followed by an old-fashioned black dress woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to my banquet, His Royal Highness Princess Sophia." Deni greeted him and kissed him with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness... Lu Xien found himself a princess fate, met the princess of the Vaurit Principality, and met the princess of the Elf Wang Ting. Now I meet the princess of the Holy Heroes Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia smiled delicately: "Deni, if you don't play one song yourself, I don't think you are welcoming me from the bottom of my heart." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucian almost spit out, his eyes slightly lifted, and suddenly collided with the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old eyes blinked and seemed to see the strength of the Knights of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very willing to play a song for you, Princess Royal." When Dennie and Sophia "good sisters" talked and laughed, Alten stood abruptly When it came out, Jocelyn’s face suddenly became a little ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone knows, Princess Sophia is an avid piano enthusiast, but because of the lack of knight strength and musical talent, her piano plays very poorly, and she is also the Empire. The second successor, the fifth-level blood sorcerer, and the countless aristocratic children are pursuing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny stunned, he was just joking, and Sophia’s clear green eyes did not see a wave of elegant smiles: “I’m looking forward to your performance, Alten "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alten excitedly walked to the piano in the middle of the hall and played the music skillfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien couldn’t help but lick his forehead. Isn’t this "Dedication to Silvia"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, the music ended, the aristocrats present were applauding, although Alten was not good at music, but with the control of the big knight and specialized training. It is very easy to play a piano piece, and it is another matter to be able to integrate feelings to a high level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Princess Sophia’s beautiful smile, the green eyes of the twinkling dreams, Alten proudly stood up and bowed, then looked provocatively to Borak, see Well, your rude barbarian, even if he became the Duke of the Gorse, is also a shame to the family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about the impulsive reaction that Borak had. He smiled and stood up and saluted Sophia: "His Royal Highness, can play impromptu for you." One?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Deni and Alten were astonished at the same time, suspecting that they had illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s horrified expression flashed away, keeping the royal family smiled and said: “I was really surprised, I didn’t expect you to stand up, but if Bo You can play beautiful piano music, then I will have confidence in myself. Can you give confidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gaze, pink lips Lightly scented, the aroma is slightly exposed, no one seems to resist her charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask your Royal Highness to listen carefully." Lucien has a heart, no feelings about her amazing charm, smiled and turned to the front of the piano, hands pressed Above the black keys, then gently move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful impromptu melody sounded leisurely, Denny opened his mouth and couldn’t believe it was a rude barbarian, and Alten’s face was blue, doubting that Borak was very May have benefited in the black market, maybe with the strength of the Cavaliers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few dozen seconds of music is over, Sophia smiles applause with a beautiful and dignified applause: "I am full of confidence in myself, Borak, I can’t think of you also have excellent Music talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Sophia, Lucien smiled politely: "I have a secret about this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What? Can you tell me?" Sophia blinked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Gentleman: "Of course, but only tell the Princess Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other aristocrats clearly see that the bastard is trying to get close to the princess, but they can only watch it for a while. What secret is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia turned her head and smiled: "I can’t wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien The mouth came to her ear and whispered: "If you only play the black button, you can also play the piano when you are under the Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hehe..." Sophia thought carefully, and suddenly laughed out loudly. The smile was as beautiful as a blossoming flower, which led to the complex eyes of Alten and others on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
