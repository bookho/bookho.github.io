			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the moon falling?" Both Anord and Douglas were shocked by the sigh of "Death Lord" and raised their heads. Looking into the dark and dull sky, the magical runes in their respective eyes circulate, flashing different colors, "holes" the cover of the dark clouds, directly seeing a cold and blurred silver moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Moon does not really fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a long sigh of relief in their hearts, eliminating the visual effect of magic blessing, if the "silver moon does not fall, the moon is not awkward" Na was killed by the "God Drop", there is really no hope on my own side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to the meaning of Lord "Death Lord", Silver Moon has not been able to block "God Drop"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a god, can’t you counter the “God Drop” strike? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief gratitude, strong disappointment and confusion rose, making the magicians such as Plyhill, Nielsen, and Congos feel awkward, and the Pope was powerful. To this extent? Is there any possibility of victory? Did the "Death Lord" feel the sorrow and frustration? When he was at its peak, even the Pope's "God Drop" was not forced out, let alone now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Return each other, wait until the church's counter-attack wave calms down and discuss other things." "Death lord" Tananos floated a layer of pale white After the fog, the fog faded, and the whole person disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod converges and restores the state of laughter: "Whatever we do, no matter what the pope does, how do we do it, maybe he uses 'God' 'I have to pay a great price? During this time, we completely hide, do not have any action, but pay attention to observe the changes in the relationship between the nobility and the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We are not so stupid, and we have always been played with people." Plyhill snorted. "You have said that the 'dark blue demon' and other big aristocrats are close together, hoping to achieve results as soon as possible!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is confused by this wonderful future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the same can't wait to beat their own eyes, Annod smiled: "Reassure, no problem, we will closely observe and contact Sharp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we left." Plysilk resisted the urge to throw a big fireball, looked up again, and sighed with a sigh. "No. Know when you can see 'Daylight'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After dawn, it is a raging wave." Nelson's ruby ​​eyes with a touch of light Repressed and sentimental, the meaning in the discourse is very different from that of Plyhill. He is especially worried about the revenge of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annord snorted: "No one of Tanninos is flustered. What are we anxious? After this incident, he is the main goal of the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the "death lord" just made him feel that something might change, and the church's counterattack would not be too strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you didn't lie this time." Plyhill said faintly, and turned and flew into the "Destroyer Tower" that became transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other magicians left, Douglas said: "Does Rieger reveal the location of Aringe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Annaud did not hesitate to answer, as if he had been with Rig and knew everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling his self-confidence, Fernando suddenly realized: "Invading the mind, weaving memories, Rigg has long been... Old Fox, you just lied to me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is young and inexperienced, his own ingenuity is not enough to deny his character, so at this time he once again raised his own too young and too naive idea, actually Unreservedly believe the explanation of the old fox! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More deceived by me, no one can deceive you later." Anord looked kindly like a younger generation, "Look Douglas, who had noticed this problem before, but because it had no effect on him, he pretended not to know, did not expose me, and suddenly asked when he needed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this age is compared with other high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day, one day, I will listen to your lies as a joke." Fernando admits that the old fox said it makes sense, but he refuses to admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and said: "I have confirmed this, I am relieved, Mr. President, I have been stationed in Allinge during this time, if there is The magic problem and the experience of how to make a plan want to teach me, I will trouble you to come to Allinge. Of course, if I have doubts, I will write a letter to communicate with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He probably figured out Anord’s temper and character, and he was no longer so cautious, but he made a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the young people nowadays are getting less and less polite, and I want my old man to go to Allinge personally." Annod sighed deliberately. Although Douglas is not young, but compared with his old man who has lived for thousands of years, he is still a young man. "Well, don't let Allinge be dismantled. I still intend to have time to study it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he turned to look at Fernando: "You contacted Old Green at this time, and you are always in control of Sharp, regardless of whether the church is killing him." Still not killing him, the situation is good for us, hey, Fernando, if you have the opportunity, you will use that belt to become a girl, then go to Hathaway as a court teacher."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll!" Fernando yelled angrily, and his heart vaguely understood the role of "letting away" Ketonia, but shouldn't it be easier to let him go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the remains of the "death of the soul" in the forest, overhead The "Death Lord" floating in a black giant python walked among them, and he actually returned here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the condition of 'Silver Moon'?" He said suddenly to the deserted, dark, rotten forest, and the voice was as if it had been from the grave. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to blood sensation, it is not fatal, but it takes a long time to recover." The darkness of no one suddenly surging, a figure condensed out, he Wearing a red coat and a black jacket with a collar up to the top, holding a silver hair to the shoulders, the eyes are as fascinating as the silver moon in the sky, the appearance is flawless, and even more beautiful than the lady, enough to call it a demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and looked at the "Death Lord" and regretted the truth: "Why is every legendary magician of the Necromancer so ugly? Gloomy? When I first met you, how pure and innocent you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the Pope?" "Death Lord" has long learned Ignore the boring topic of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After occupying Tria, I returned to Lance, maybe we can expect some situation to emerge." Silver-haired man shook his head, "Abel Dead, I am very sad, you look like this, I am even more sad, hehe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abel is dead? Dracula will be very happy... ..." "Death Lord" stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart, the Cathedral of Glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Death Lord' joined forces with 'Iceland Witch' and 'Curse Eyes'? Did he return to third order?" with all Gusta Empire Like the man, Franz, who came from this country, has a thick beard, his face full of mottled traces of the years, only the green eyes, no trace of vicissitudes, deep and holy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "Heart of Time" Ketonia's report, he seized the key to the problem for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia coughed twice: "Well, if you don't have him, whether it's the 'ice of the ice' or the 'curse of the curse', I will not let In my eyes, most of my current injuries are caused by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His body is disconnected from the waist, leaving only half of it, flesh and blood Creeping growth, trying to recover, can continue to rot into yellowish pus, stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
