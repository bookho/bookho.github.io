Walking in the dark, in addition to those who are drunk and whose identity cannot be exposed, belong to the back of the light, and the church The night watchman of the referee, who often wanders in every corner of the night like a greedy vulture, chasing the bloody and carrion, the black gloves worn on their hands, the eyes of every magician and magic apprentice in Aalto. The source of nightmares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, just in this house." Ten minutes later, I saw that I had to walk out of the house where the messy construction, the complex terrain, and the dirty Ade When the district went to the gates leading to the aristocratic district, the sage stopped and pointed to the same ordinary building surrounded by many ordinary ruined houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sage, whether it is white honey or Smyr, they are more trustworthy, each investigating magic, and simply check the house and its surroundings. After confirming the security, I followed the sage and went in. Lucien saw the scouting magic they used, including all the scouting magic that they had except the "bat scream", and gave up the check, just using the mental power. Inductive, after all, the shortcoming of "bat screaming" is that it is impossible to detect the situation inside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilapidated house is covered with spider webs. It seems that no one has lived for a long time. The sage walked to the bedroom and said freely: "Previously There will be beggars staying here, but in recent months, Aalto’s beggars have all disappeared for some reason.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and White Honey Without speaking, Smyr said a bit strangely: "Why are the beggars missing? What can they do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that it is evil creature Related.” The Sage’s tone replied plainly, and seemed to have heard of some insider, while Lucien and White Honey remained silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the bedroom, the sage removes the broken box and uses the corresponding magic to remove the hidden magic trap and open the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold breeze blows out from the inside without a bit of rancid, dull scent. It seems that this secret passage is often used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Don't the sage be a member of the aristocratic area, often use this secret road to go to the Adejan district to attend a secret meeting? This is the idea that Lu Xien, white honey and other people have in mind, but no one will be stupid to ask such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inspection, under the leadership of the sage, several magic apprentices successively entered the secret passage and closed the entrance here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret road is very flat, planting the kind of glowing moss in the sewer, the fluorescent cold is cold, people can't help but fear and chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien et al. have noticed that every ten meters, there is a “micro-effect fossil-forming mud” magic array above the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This simplified magical array can be activated no matter who uses mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the doubts of Mr. Professor, white honey, and owl, and the sage smiles and explains: "This is to destroy the secret passage for an emergency, let it not "Discussed by people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like your caution and care." Lucien used a hoarse voice and a strong attitude to the professor. Praise the Sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey also smiled and said: "I am relieved a lot now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten minutes later, in a dark corner of the aristocratic area, under the cover of many tall shade trees, Lucien and others climbed out one by one. Under the leadership of the sages who are familiar with it, I quickly found the old three-storey villa that Baron Laurent looked desolate and creepy, covered with green vines and resembled a haunted house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smyr looked at the nearby environment and made a suggestion: "It's very remote, there is only one gatekeeper. We might as well go in directly, Professor, do you think it is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not make a big move." Lucien gestured to Smyr to give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage who was covered in a black hood, grabbed it in front of Smyr, stood up, and the old voice said with a smile: " This kind of thing is still given to me as an apprentice of the astrology system. Do you think, Mr. Professor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave a gloomy laugh: Yes, professional things should be handed over to professional people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not very suitable for Mr. Professor’s words and grammar habits, but white honey, sage I heard the meaning and I nodded. I felt that it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Mr. Professor has made a decision, Smyr can only spread his hands: "Then I will cooperate with you, the sage,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke is standing outside the gate of the Baron Laurent Villa, yawning from time to time, silently complaining to Baron Laurent: "A dance is held every few days. It’s really dead to support the aristocratic face. Hey, only one month to give us ten sinners who are loyal to the Laurent family. My father and grandfather, when they were under the old baron, were twenty Yinnar.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complaining and fighting against sleep, Luke suddenly heard the owl calling, was a little chilly and timid by the snoring, could not help but turn his head and look at the past Cursing: "Don't catch your mouse, don't be slow like my 60-year-old grandmother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night, Lu Nothing could be seen, but when he turned around, he found that a dozen steps were standing, a mysterious man who was covered in black robes and horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge fear hit Luke’s heart, he was about to yell, but he saw the black robe mysterious man, looked up slightly and looked at himself. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shadow of the hood, this mysterious black robes, the nose, mouth, cheeks are blurred, only those eyes, just like in front of the eyes, clear visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep and dark pupils, there are countless flaws in the light, so complicated, so dreamy, like the stars in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stars..." Looking at these eyes, Luke’s face was first confused, then quickly relaxed, feeling that the other person was his most trusted and respected person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage saw that Luke had been hypnotized by the "eye of the stars" and walked up to him. The old voice said without hesitation: "We are Come to the Baron Ball, open the door, let us in, the voice is light, don't wake others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect your wishes, this is what I should Do." Luke turned and opened the door slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien, the sage, the white honey and the Smyr, carefully passed the gate and went to the dark villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they entered, Luke did not close the door, but turned around, guarding his head, and never been serious and enthusiastic, it seems to be in my heart. There was a fire burning in the face and I wanted to do more for the gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden doors of the villa are firmly locked and the windows are thickly covered with curtains. Covered, do not let a little light reveal, the hall is filled with a thick (lead) × 靡 feeling, men's wheezing, women's sputum, aroma, body odor and body fluid mixed with people's bloody strange smell, all over the air Every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa, on the carpet, on the coffee table, there are pairs of men, women, men, women and women in the entanglement, movement, and some completely off, falling Out of the white and smooth nude × body, and some just push the skirt to the waist, the upper body is opened, the clothes are eagerly handed over × cohesive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this (quote) chaos, let the people in it can't help but indulge in the degraded environment, but some people are completely different from them, beautiful The flesh and frenzied atmosphere turned a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange smell of (引)×靡 slowly floated to the altar, and with the silver-white corner pattern of the middle-aged man’s feet standing, there was a silvery line shining, and these were The atmosphere is concentrated behind the middle-aged man, and it is getting thicker and thicker. The colorless black gas is condensed by the colorless. This gas is twisted and twisted, and slowly changes into a tall shadow of a double horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you ready? I will give you my strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phantom Suddenly speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man, also the Baron Laurent, replied wildly: "The great silver master, the eternal silence, I have already made my soul." Dedicated to you, let the 'angels' you send into my blood and stimulate my strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow is transparent, can't see the pattern It slowly leans forward and is attached to the back of the Baron Laurent, blending in with a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurent Baron’s face showed a painful expression. Obviously, the fusion of projection power was not a pleasant thing, but the pain was quickly suppressed by fanaticism. It’s just that the corner of the eye seems to have a sparkling glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[There are a lot of magic traps on the outside. No one can stop me from accepting the power of the great Silver Lord and restore the glory of the family. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the villa, as a magic apprentice, Lucien et al. Instead of recklessly slamming in, it is investigating magic traps, secret magic arrays, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Professor, there are a lot of magic traps, and even a magical array. It takes us half an hour to break the big movements." The sage said his judgment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey seems to have a magical item that can sense the evil creature's breath. At this time, it is a bit flustered: "We are late, the devil has already appeared. For up to ten minutes, it will be fully projected, we must break in directly, and we can't slowly crack the magic array and traps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go, break the magic trap, we don’t have much mental power left.” Smyr looked at Lucien. “Mr. Professor, you can only ask for your hands. Only the strongest you can get the fastest and easiest. Get rid of these magic traps and magic arrays."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things due to the cautious delays of the magic apprentices along the way, there has been a huge change, the sage, white honey followed Smyr looked at Lucien. Although they didn't talk, there were countless thoughts in their hearts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[My magic charm can only be destroyed Drop that magical array, and there are so many magic traps, is it really necessary to teach Mr.】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mr. Professor will be a real magician? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[How powerful is the strength of Professor Mr.? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[If Mr. Professor is not a formal magician, will he no longer participate in the party because he is afraid of the teacher of white honey? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of complex emotions such as worry, doubt, expectation, etc., Lucy, who has been standing quietly and seems to be measuring, puts out The cold smile smiles: "No problem, I will solve it quickly, they will soon lose their effect, you are ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Mr. Confidence......]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this strange atmosphere, Lucien approaches the villa, hands out, presses on the wall, then the mouth opens, again Make a silent spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible fluctuations spread out of Lucian’s hands, passed to the wall, and fed back, causing the subsequent fluctuations to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a black robe, his face covered by a hood, Lucien quietly pressed the wall of the villa, nothing happened, sage, white honey When people look at each other, they feel the doubts in the other's eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[What is Mr. Professor doing? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
