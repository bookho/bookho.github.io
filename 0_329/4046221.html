			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing this beautiful and exquisite Holm crown ring on the right middle finger, Lucien immediately felt the spirits condense and the body seemed to be covered by the spring. Washed it over, washed away the hidden scars and dust, full of vitality, which almost made Lucien think that his magician and knight level both improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a seven-level perfect magic ring. The three magic effects are obviously refining for my situation.” Lucien's mouth I did not notice it, and the wealthy and collecting side made him look very happy. "With the 'element' ring, I will raise my soul and spiritual strength to the level of the three rings. It takes only two to three years. Use the Arcane Point to purchase the appropriate magical pharmacy. Maybe I can become a mid-level magician before I reach the age of 20."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you simply study The Book of Astrology and Elements, with the spiritual talent of Lucien higher than the ordinary magic apprentice but far from the standard of strength and genius, may be hoped to be promoted to the middle magician after twenty or thirty years, and has little grasp Unless in these years the body and soul are transformed through dangerous, evil, bloody magical rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the mathematical knowledge from the soul library, Lucien is much simpler when it comes to the analysis of complex curves, surfaces, etc. It is easy to construct, and the requirements for the soul and spiritual power are greatly reduced. It takes only about ten years to hope to hit the third ring. Now there is the "Brooky Thoughts", with the "Elements" ring, with all kinds of magical pharmacy, material resources, and a magical research bridge that links his knowledge to the laws of the world, then become a medium in a year or two. The magician, flying in the blue sky is not a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, any advancement in the relationship has the potential to fail. The more you go, the more you go, the more you fail in the promotion of the ranks, the Master, the legend. There is a danger of death and it may be escalated step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This level of magic ring is worth at least a few hundred thousand Jintal or Arcane points, that is, a bustling city with all the manors, towns around it, The value of the village is equivalent to the wealth of a Viscount or a relatively poor Earl. In comparison, the Magic Council's rewards are really pitiful. It is no wonder that the Holm Crown Award is the highest honor in the field of elements and alchemy. The value of this ring is set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien carefully looked at the ring of his right hand, his thoughts fluttered: "I heard that several others imitate Huo The award set by Erm Crown is also a magical item that rewards the seven-level perfection. The immortal throne is a talisman or a necklace. The Silvermoon Medal and the Ice and Snow Medal are badges. The Wizard's Laurel is a crown, a headgear, a mage cap, glasses, etc. that can be worn on the head. Something, the Arcane Scepter is a magic wand, which is very expensive and very valuable. If you can get it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, road Sean feels that his mouth is flowing out quickly. , And he had cleared his throat, to maintain calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite Morris saw Lucien staring at Holm's crown ring, he could feel his mood, only felt like a knife, refining This ring is not too difficult for him and the alchemist of the two elements, but wants to achieve perfect order, constant three magic effects, the materials used are very precious and rare, often have no price, big In some cases, even if you use a country to change, you can't change it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that I have to go to the patrol every day to appreciate the elemental will and Holm Royal Devil’s Court half-face warehouse has a lot less material, Morris is really vomiting blood In all moods, fortunately, according to the frequency, the Holm Crown Award will be awarded once in ten years, so that he will not go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the award ceremony, most of the arcane masters disappeared without a five-minute disappearance, and they rushed to try Lucien to purify The idea of ​​the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reluctantly put down his right hand and is preparing to go to Lazar and return to Allinge. At this time, the white hair, a pair of quirky deep yellow eyes and eagle hook nose, Gaston and a blonde, mature and beautiful big beauty came together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, don't know how you feel about the will of our elements? Are you interested in joining?" Gaston opened the door, and Morris, who had not left, smiled. Watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien submits the periodic table of elements in order to get the attention of the will of the element, naturally he does not hesitate to answer: "I am very interested in elemental magic, and these The connection between the heavens and the elements will be very pleasant, and I am very happy to join the will of the elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a low-level magician, the element will be the same as the pale hand, giving only things worth fifty to two hundred arcane points, while Lucien has not yet updated the arcane badge, but in the eyes of everyone. He is already a genuine fourth-order arcane master, and has a glory aura bonus to the Holm Crown Award! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what obligations do I have?" After the handshake, Lucien asked seriously, although he liked the rules of giving gifts like this, but eating The mouth of the family is short, and the hand of the family is soft. This reason is that the road is very clear, such as the original Wilfrid led the poor Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris has finished his purple elemental magic robe neckline and smiled and replied: "We give members protection in the organization and let them grow smoothly in the Magic Council." Similarly, we also need members to contribute to the organization. Generally speaking, it is in the form of giving tasks. Of course, if we feel that the task is too dangerous, we can pay the appropriate price. We will not force members to do things that they are not sure. Of course, Evans is just a magician. For a genius who is not strong enough and has great potential, before you become a middle or even high-level, it will only be a research task."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am relieved, thank you, Lord Morris." Lucien thought about it, but did not find the Holm crown ring that Natasha gave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris took a picture of Lucien’s shoulder: “You have a keen mind, a rigorous logic, and a modest character. I am very optimistic about your future. I hope that you can move forward on the road of arcane. Well, you will wait until you get to the Royal Tower of Holm to register and collect things. The rest is explained to you by Florosa, about your mission. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he looked away from the Holm crown ring and walked out of the hall with Gaston, leaving Lucien alone to face maturity Glamorous Florencia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa had a faint smile, and the beautiful green eyes looked at Lucien again and again from top to bottom, and finally satisfied one The roots bend their fingers: "Beautiful, elegant, polite, clever, speakable, sharp-minded, modest and decent, and have a reputation and status. Lucien is really a dream lover of ladies. To be honest, I want to be with you. Dating." She shouted Lu Xien directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t think that the beautiful woman with a hot body and mature temperament was so enthusiastic and direct, and suddenly she was embarrassed. I don’t know how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s cautious look, Florenza grinned and smirked: “It’s a young man, I’m afraid there is no experience. Unfortunately, I am married. Otherwise, you will be able to teach you well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this bold style of married women, Lucian can only be speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa stopped the laughter and said with a flattering manner: "Lu Xien, you are already a fourth-order arcane master, according to the rules of the Magic Council. The ranks, so they automatically leave the Douglas Magic School, unless you want to kick Donald and become the principal. In fact, I would like to see a Holm crown winner in school, it will be a sensation News.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These kingdoms across the sea, thanks to the advancement of papermaking and printing under the influence of magic research, newspapers and journals are more important than mainland China. Rich and active, when Lucien walked to the streets of Rentatt, he often heard newsboys shouting: “Sell newspapers, sell newspapers, and freshly released Holm Weekly.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I really like the quiet environment of the school." Lucien is quite a bit emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa put away his charming expression, it is rare to say seriously: "You are already in the middle class, so you have to accept the task of the parliament, I am afraid that some play with the dead. The guy will take the opportunity to deal with you, so I will arrange a task for you in advance, so that you will not let you run around and delay the golden stage of absorbing and learning the knowledge of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Florencia, what is the mission?" Lucien also became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa looked at Lucien’s tight face and suddenly smiled and gracefully said: “Don’t be so serious, a very simple task. Part of the Druids in the East Stroop Forest followed their great elder legend, Druid Malfurion, to Aringe, preparing to conduct a research project with the Magic Council."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elder has been guarding the forest, guarding the land, and at the same time sympathizing with the bottom farmers, thinking that they have worked hard for a year, and the harvested food is only enough to pay taxes to the lord. And reluctant to starve, often can not live 50 years old, in the face of natural disasters and other agricultural production cuts, there is no hope. And his druids include less than 1,000 apprentices, even the Druids of the whole continent Less than 10,000, and the use of spells also consume mental energy, so want to use the spell to help farmers increase production, only a small number of people benefit, even a country's farmers can not help."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
