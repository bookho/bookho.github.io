			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few Canon songs, Victor has thoroughly explained this basic form of polyphony, including Lucien, Felice, etc. From time to time, people ask questions and get satisfactory answers. Finally, Victor smiles and looks at his students: "I know that you are working hard and are very careful. You have already started to learn from Canon, so you may wish to write a Canon. You understand that polyphonic music, chords, and creating more complex pieces are very helpful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lott, Felice, Herodotus The expression of eagerness to try, and Lucian is contemplative, Victor is slightly puzzled: "Lu Xien, although you have a very good musical talent, but the foundation is not good, you can listen to the symphony of fate played from the beginning. It’s also helpful to write a simple Canon song. Don’t think that the Canon’s melody is simple, you really want to be able to write it, and it’s very beautiful. For example, Mr. Sehr’s classic D major Canon, nearly a hundred years ago. The same is true after listening Wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucien, Victor is not like teaching his first true music disciple, now Marcus, who is touring the courts of all continents. The same, let him play his own genius and rarely interfere. In Victor's opinion, Lucien's musical talent is far more than Marcus, and can be compared with those great musicians. Because of this, as a teacher, he must give appropriate persuasion and protection, lest he be proud of himself. Big, squandering waste your own genius, it will be a major loss in the music industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned to God and explained seriously: "Mr. Victor, I will not forget the importance of the foundation, and will seriously try to compose Cannon, just now When you listen to Mr. Sehr's D major Cannon, I suddenly have some inspiration, I feel that the melody can make small changes, and why not make it into a piano piece, playing with this brand new instrument, maybe Bringing a very different flavor from the original cello and violin ensemble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Khanon's melody is very short, and it is brought to a sense of grace by repeated repetitive repetitions. The same is true of Mr. Seychel’s D major Kannon. There are only a few two-section melody. It is very difficult to make small changes.” Victor first expressed concern and then affirmed the idea of ​​Lucien. Encourage, "Of course, the D major Canon has been adapted into the organ playing, but also adapted to grow the flute, I am looking forward to seeing Lu Xien you adapt it into a piano, it may be a new music enjoyment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs "Phase" smiled: "Mr. Victor, you can rest assured that I just learned to play this style by composing and adapting Canon, and I will not blindly change it. The beauty of music can be distinguished."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are looking forward to hearing the D major Cannon piano." Seeing Victor nod, Felice and Lott smiled at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End of the music class, when practicing the instrument in the piano room, Felice deliberately took a few steps and walked side by side with Lucien, whispered: " Lucien, are you preparing to play the adapted D major Canon piano music at my next birthday party?" Her mouth was slightly hooked, like laughing, and looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the simplicity of Canon, she felt that the adaptation should not take long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was in the heart, and smiled with gratitude: "Fillis, your help to me, I will not forget. Your oyster party I will definitely play a new piece of music, but it is not an adapted D major Canon. I will use this month to try and write a happy serenade for the party style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Felice was pleasantly surprised. She had just wanted Lucine to be proficient in several piano pieces and then to play at the party. He had his musical genius and princess music consultant. The title, even if it is only a performance of past works, will greatly satisfy his vanity, but I did not expect Lucien to prepare a new serenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly replied: "But it should not be a complete movement. There may be only piano pieces composed of melody, texture and harmony." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piano Pieces are short tracks of single movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice’s hands were twisted together: “It’s a great honor, Lucine, you are such a good person.” She was very excited, even the piano pieces, But the time is short, and it is not bad to have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a good man card, Lucien himself ridiculed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not uncommon to write a small piece of serenade piano in a month, but it is a matter of fact, Felice can't help but worry because Lucien is too high now, President Christopher is The admiration of destiny, the evaluation of His Royal Highness Princess, and the praise of the "real, tribute genius" of Othello's governor have filled many people with embarrassment and dissatisfaction, waiting for Lucien to make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are like fierce beasts in the night, as long as Lucien’s newly written music does not reach a certain height, a little embarrassing, it will immediately swarm. Submerging the prey with saliva, with Felice's own oyster banquet and the hope of escorting the road will be greatly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, Felice hopes that Lucien will slowly sculpt, using a year or even two years to write a difference that is not worse than fate. How many works, so his status is completely stable, no longer a new talented musician, but a true musical authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A serenade, there should be no problem." Lucien tried to pretend that all geniuses were casual and confident. And this little nocturnal road, Sean has already thought about it, is the melody that has not appeared in this world, is the most outstanding and classic one in the serenade-like serenade, even if Lu Xien, who didn’t like classical music in his life, also I often hear, of course, for a month, Lucien must not be able to take out the complete format of the four movements, only to replace the piano pieces with the first movement, with such a prelude, not long after It is logical to expand it completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the attitude of Lucien, Felice opened her mouth, but I didn’t know how to persuade, but I was expecting and worried about the tunnel: "I am waiting for one." The first excellent serenade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The next month, Lucien learns magic, parses magic, and tries to reverse the witch's notes. In addition to the ancient Ilvanas magic empire text on the book "The Book of Astrology and Elements", it is devoted to the study of music, because it represents the hope of going to the headquarters of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With super memory and focused learning, Lucien finally learned and mastered the basic music knowledge until this time, Lucien Have the feeling that you are a qualified music student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adapted D major Canon and the serenade under the intentional control of Lucien, nearly completed in a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John continues his training with the Cavaliers, although he wants to motivate his blood as soon as possible, protect his family, and guard his home, but from Vaolirit Dagong knew that Sir Wien, who had passed through the matter, was serious about him. He couldn’t be recklessly stepping into the process of stimulating the blood, so that not only the success may be minimal, but even with the help of auxiliary materials. The land became a formal knight, and there is no hope to break through to the great knights and even the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, John, who is very admired and very fond of Sir Wien, has his own impatience, and under his arrangement, he spends most of his time boring training. A small part of the time to go to the Melzer Black Forest to fight with the goblin, the Kobold, etc. to sharpen the will and skill. At the same time, Sir Wien found an excuse to give John a sum of money to rent a house near the administrative district and take the Joel family to live in order to maximize their safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joel family enjoyed a pleasant stay in the garden villa rented in Lucien, but it is not their own home after all, and there is uncomfortable uncomfortable. So I can see that they have not been forced to stay in the way they are bound, and sometimes they are too passionate and will bring about barriers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Golden Moon (October) Thursday morning of the last week, Lata Summer Palace "War Gallery" in the piano room, road Sean has just finished his music discussion with Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this part of the melody has the excitement I want." Natasha looked at the scribbled music sheet, revealing the heartfelt and beautiful Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a solid understanding and mastery of the music knowledge and fugues, Canon and other forms than Lucien, so I heard the full format of the theme music and got After the inspiration, there will soon be some melody, but she is keen to create music with a sense of sensation, and the melody has been changed and changed. According to this progress, this symphony may not be completed in one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and smiled: "In fact, the last change has been very good, but your Princess’s request is too demanding." Sean, I couldn't keep up with Natasha's thoughts and rhythm during this time. Fortunately, she was also studying and progressing herself, and she was only a consultant rather than a teacher. She finally managed to support it and had a great harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
