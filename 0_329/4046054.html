			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staring at Wolf’s back, the door was slowly closed, and Victor took a long breath and turned his head to Taichung and The members of the Symphony Orchestra said: "You continue to practice, and suddenly there is a nice string in my mind, ready to go to the lounge to write."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone Musicians, in the association have their own lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Victor, I think your current mood and state are very unstable, it is best not to force the music to be written, it has no effect." Rhine put down the violin, Walking to the side of the table, there is always a serious and solemn expression on the face with a charming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is like a water bag that has been pierced by a needle, and it is calmly and quickly broken up, showing the appearance of exhaustion, frustration and anger: "I know, Rhine, I need to be quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine gently nodded and told Lucien and Lott: "Lusien, Lott, you accompany Mr. Victor Go to his lounge, Felice, Herodotus, and go to the piano room to practice the instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Rhein is neither a noble nor a musician, However, his excellent violin and harpsichord playing skills, as well as the unhurried manner, let Lucien and Lott have no objection to his instructions, just like Mr. Victor himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the third floor lounge, Victor did not say a word, immersed in the emotional world of disappointment and anger, and Lucien and Lott I don't know what to say, I can only quietly follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until in the lounge, Victor only said to Lucien and Lott: "You two, practice the instrument well, and bring the door when you go out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he sat down on the couch and quietly looked at the opposite wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went outside and looked at Victor’s gaze. On the wall, there was a painting with a painting on it. A pretty brunette with a black hair and a slender face, a quiet smile on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole painting is very good, this woman is like a living real person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War outside the door, in the process of slowly closing the wooden door, Lucien saw that Victor was just staring at the painting, without any movement, like a statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lott silently returning to the piano room on the fourth floor, road Sean discovered that Felice and Herodotus did not practice the instrument, but sat down in a low mood and didn't know what to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, with the request of Othello's director, Mr. Victor's concert will at least not be messed up." Lott thought he would be very happy. When I was able to say it, I found out that I had a deep bitterness in my tone. I followed Mr. Victor for several years. He was so gentle and kind, and always cared about others. Even though Lott’s heart was hidden, he looked down on him. Thoughts of birth, but accumulated, the feelings are still very deep. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if Victor can take advantage of the great success of this concert, he is among the ranks of famous musicians, and Nalot can ignore McKin if he participates in the evaluation of musicians. The martyrdom and prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice smiled silently, equally bitter: "Even if the problem of the music is solved according to the requirements of the Othello director, Mr. Victor’s state, who To ensure that when a musician is commanding, if there are frequent problems, will the whole concert be effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Relative Lott The age, and also the seemingly brilliant Herodotus could not help but put his forehead on the violin, as if he was talking in a dream, the sound was erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the entire piano room was quiet and could hear the sound of the needle falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Lucien, who is in a daze, is less noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien is analyzing the scores he has included in the soul library and comparing it with the scores on the earth, lest he copy one The symphony came out, and the result was almost the same as the existing music chords in the world, so the reputation of the idiot plagiarist was on the music path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Fortunately, in order to practice reading the spectrum, the music scores on the earth are marked with the music symbols of the world. Otherwise, it will take more than a month. 】 Lu Xien feels lucky when comparing the music scores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same chord in the Soul Library is easier to imagine than Lucien, because it is stored in your own soul, you only need to read it again. Retrieve the score of the same string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this period of study, Lucien learned more about the world's musical trends, and when the church did not suppress, Aalto's music was In the classical music with strict structure and some religious music characteristics, the stage of slow transition and development towards romantic music expressing his inner feelings, therefore, the conservative Lu Xien, the first choice is Bach’s music, which has Typical religious features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[All of Bach's music, there are very similar music, "Average Piano Collection" and "Twelve Equal Piano Collection" The height is the same, but fortunately I did not rush out. Lucien is satisfied with his own prudence, although the things that this kind of caution is facing are not good things to be proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny Bach’s music, Lucien is most familiar with, of course, Beethoven’s nine symphonies, so the most familiar Symphony of Destiny (c Minor Fifth Symphony) found out: [No similar melody? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a symbol of classical music, the Symphony of Destiny is very suitable for Aalto's music trend, and it is shocking, Lucien does not want to waste time, consider After a while, I decided to choose this piece of music. At the same time, the curious Lucian, comparing the other eight symphonies of Beethoven and thirty-two piano sonatas, found that there was basically no similar melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other musicians, based on modern piano, or classical or romantic music, due to the appearance of the piano, limited by the defects of the previous instrument, Lucian After picking a few comparisons, there is definitely no similar music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected the Symphony of Destiny, Lucien began to have a headache, how to "give" Victor's problem, it is impossible to copy it directly to him, or 哼Singing the melody made him hear, and when he asked about the origin, he told him that it was found in the cracks of a certain book, just like the legendary hero who relied on similar adventures to get magical swordsmanship and exercise blood strength. It is impossible to tell him that he has saved a beggar or a sick man who is dying of illness in a certain month of the year. He was given this score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These excuses are getting harder and harder to believe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Lucien suspects that Victor will exceed his ethical standards and will probably not use the music without the consent of the original author. The good way is to pretend to write it yourself, and then leave obvious defects, let Victor modify and perfect, so he gave him the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for hypnosis, with the current mental power of Lucien, it is impossible to instill too much information to Victor, most of which will be forgotten after waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student who can only study music for about two months, even the piano can only barely play simple music, unless there is a similar string before. The law appears in the mind, otherwise it is impossible to write such a symphony that is so shocking, so penetrating, so beautiful, and whether Lucien has had good music teaching before, whether it shows musical talent, it is very easy Isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Well, just try it. 】 Lu Xien thought that after the brain exploded, he finally thought of a way, so he stood up suddenly, went to the piano, put a few white sheets on the music stand, took a quill, and began to write music symbols. After writing a small string of chords, put your hands on the piano keys and press them down heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dangdang Dangdang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lotus, Felice, Herodotus The heated, loud voice was shocked, either lifting his head from his hands or subconsciously turning his face to look at Lucien or almost falling from the bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rhythm, very imposing "when", the next piece of string is simply unbearable and can be called noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lot's eyebrows wrinkled: "Lusien, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
