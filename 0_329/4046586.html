Can you tell me why you are? Can you make such an estimate? Why would you choose us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coughing two times to stop the smile, Oliver on Lucien in most arcane The image in the eyes of the teacher has a deeper experience. Hearing his name is more horrifying than hearing the Hell Lord and the abyss will, especially when his name is associated with the thesis, especially this is contrary to the routine. Review process, just like Brook at the time Kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Choose your review because you can see from the papers in the last three months of "Magic" and "Electromagnetic" that you already have the idea And began to study in depth, so you certainly won't know the world is broken." Oliver said the real reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did presuppose the fate of the two with astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we have a sprout of similar ideas?" Ankhla recalled in confusion, quickly aware of what, "you are talking about your study of transforming equations, And a deeper reflection on the relationship between time and space?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver gently daggers: "Yes, I believe that after reading this paper, you should gain a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was suspicious, and the hands took the paper slightly trembled. Angela and Mariana saw the title of the thesis: "On the electrodynamics and mass equations of moving objects." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the name doesn't look too subversive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the two began to read carefully, with more feather pens and white paper on hand, and from time to time calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it, Angela did not take the pen’s left hand and subconsciously grabbed her hair and made the white hair slanting, which seemed to be full of this direction. Interest is difficult to understand, and the head is swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mariana made a bite-hitting action that she often had when she was young, and muttered in her mouth: "Time? Space? How could this be?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver folded his hands and fingers together, and looked at them calmly, but their eyes were quite dignified by their reaction. After eight months of brewing, it should not Then there is a big headshot event, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the theory of relativity has not been perfect for the time being. They should be able to see some problems. At most, they are confused and not cognizant. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, suddenly, Angela looked up and looked a little fanatical and confused: "I can hardly believe that time is a function of speed. It is so full of magic, and, and there are still many problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lucien himself said, this is only a preliminary, narrow sense The paper has not yet imported the things of the habitual family. There are still many problems that have not been solved, but I think this view of time and space is very interesting.” Oliver smiled and said that for him with a humanistic artistic atmosphere, this view of time and space is more in line with him. Appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This completely refactors the perception of time and space. If it was not the thinking of the previous months, maybe my cognitive world has broken and solidified due to the chaos of time and space. Hey, Lord Oliver, this paper should have been proposed by Mr. Evans a few months ago? The discussion during this time is to give us psychological and intellectual preparations?" Angela suddenly woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver nodded lightly: "Yes, before my transformation equations were published. This paper has a name for our research on macro and high-speed dimensions. The contribution, maybe the planet could not find out the reasons for this. I think you should also be able to see its value, of course, and see where it is not perfect."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I think most of the high-level arcans of the electromagnetic and light-dark factions can barely accept this paper. It has a close relationship with the classical electromagnetic theory, blinding the past to electromagnetic theory. The old ideas have been cleaned up." Angela agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angela frowned, only to find that from this paper, the ether has no effect, so quietly withdrew from the historical stage, the roots of the volatility seems to be revised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Mariana’s words, Oliver smiled bitterly: “Ether, volatility, particles, we’ve been arguing about this issue for years, but So far, they have become increasingly incomprehensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it’s like a knight of war, the two sides are fiercely attacking, but no one can break that gap. Get the final victory.” Mariana also woke up, “Her Oliver, this paper needs to confirm the results and the phenomenon to give the appropriate assessment results.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Oliver took another paper and unfolded in front of them: "This is a paper on the improvement of the electromagnetic cyclotron submitted by Lucien. The relativistic effect is clearly observed. In addition, I have some problems with artificial planets. It involves space and time changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to see them adapt well, Oliver dared to come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this paper, Angela knocked on her head: "If that period of "Arcane" I pay more attention to this issue. The discussion may not take such a long time. In two or three months, I will be able to export Mr. Evans' electrodynamic papers myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shows that Ivan Mr. Si's thoughts and directions are correct, but the paper is not perfect enough.” Mariana also gave her own opinion, and then greatly appreciated the quality formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the introduction of the new alchemy, their name for Lucien changed from Evans to Mr. Evans, but the meaning is very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the office of the Arcane Audit Committee, Angela soon received a paper on the Alchemy Life Transfer, no more reading, directly mentioning the feather pen to write the review Opinion:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the sublimation of the Speaker’s movement system, which fixes the limitations of its accuracy at low speed and extends the concept of movement to macro and high speed. The scale has initially solved many problems of the integration of the two systems since the perfection of electromagnetic theory. Let us see the hope that the arcane will eventually establish a unified theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And starting from the few premise assumptions that Mr. Evans preached, we were surprised to find that our understanding of time and space seems to be in a magical direction, completely different from the time and space we have known in the past. The mysterious mystery is full of magic. It not only subverts the construction of time and space in our cognitive world, but also subverts the concepts that we have established based on absolute time and space in our daily life. It has fascinated me like never before. And even some doubt the value of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's hard to believe that time will slow down as speed increases, and space will shrink as speed increases. All of this goes against our intuitive understanding and imagination based on it, but the equations seem to contain enough persuasiveness, as if they are closer to the origin of the world, and Mr. Evans has observed in electromagnetic cyclotron acceleration. The theoretical effect of speed and quality increase, at this moment, my heart seems to have a sacred door collapsed, and a new door can be re-emerged on its ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the relativistic system established by Mr. Evans is not perfect enough to solve the problem of the habitual family name, its value is undoubted, especially the quality formula that identifies the relationship between quality and energy is full. The beauty of mathematics and arcaneism is simple and powerful, hiding the mystery of deep and unimaginable, just like the goddess's poetry Brooke equations, anyone who sees them without being shocked and attracted, Ken There is no arcane talent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quality and energy, time and space, this is the magic of the world, maybe we can get extremely powerful power from this Based on this, I made the following assessment of Mr. Evans's thesis: This paper will have the magic of changing the times after it is perfected. It is our understanding of time and space and the wisdom of quality, and we can see that It will establish a system of relativity, so it is recommended to reward the Arcane points by three thousand and the Arcane point of 80,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are still many problems, Can establish a system, Angela did not give the evaluation and rewards of the new alchemy, the parliament did not award the title of the Arcane Master, but Mariana who made similar evaluation results, he felt suffocated, which seems to mean Lucy Yep? Whether Evans is starting from a new alchemy or a special theory of relativity, he can become a real Arcanist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
