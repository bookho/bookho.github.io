			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least half an hour after the black shadow left, a residual image was swept from the other end of the ramp, with a faint black light that waved like a wave of water. The calm and deepness contains the violent and destructive taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterimage was stopped in front of the barbed wire, and the expression was dignified to check the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 30-something man in a black shirt, black dress, black trousers, black leather shoes and a black bow tie. The beard is trimmed neatly. The black hair is all combed back and the oil is smooth – this is a new trend that the Aalto upper aristocrats have just learned from other kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is a person who pays attention to dressing and is very identifiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he is not a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is Long Sang? Aaron,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Aaron gang, as long as he often contacts The leaders of Sang Aaron know that Aaron’s boss is trying to chase the elegance of the aristocratic style. In fact, there has always been a group of unexplained anger burning in his heart, exuding endless viciousness, resentment and anger. Deeply afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Sang? Aaron is actually a knight who has inspired the blood, even to break through the limitations of the mortal body and become the strongman of the great knight. But the tragedy is that the blood force he inspires is a dark surname, so he can not only become a true aristocrat, but also be given a gifted manor, enjoy a noble and beautiful life, leave the title of the Lord for future generations, and avoid the church. It is like a mouse that runs through the sewers and does not dare to run in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the ancient magical empire, ruled the sky, the earth, the ocean, conquered many different spaces, when knights, pastors, etc. mastered the extraordinary strength of the profession, in the division of strength I did not consciously refer to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-ring spell "flying", the six-ring spell "spell trigger", and the powerful nine-ring magic have caused the magician's essential surname to leap. In addition, just in these three levels, the magician's soul and mental strength will be mutated, and the life expectancy will be improved. Therefore, in the ancient magical empire, a ring mage and a second ring mage will be called the first-level magician, the second ring. To the five-ring Master, called the middle magician, the six-ring to eight-ring is called the high-level magician, and the nine-ring is called the Grand Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to this division, the Cavaliers linked their four levels of blood power to the three, six, nine, and legendary four magician levels. Then compare the strength of the division to improve the level of not so horrible, so stimulate the blood power, become the knight, the first level, the second level is the knight often said, the third to fifth is the big knight, the sixth to eighth is the knight, nine The level is the golden knight, and the top is the epic knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the division of the pastor level. After becoming a middle-level priest, most of them become bishops, so the third to fifth grades are called bishops. High-ranking priests often serve as cardinals. As for the priests of the ninth grade, there is no special title. If they can enter the cardinal, they will work as a cardinal with the "priests of the Holy Spirit". If not, Still a cardinal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Vaurit Principality is not a hidden, secret powerhouse. The Cavaliers are more than 400, and the Cavaliers are only fifty. Many, the Knights rank is less than ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these knights, more than half of them are members of the Violet Knights, each stationed in a key place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a second-level knight, as a strongman who is about to break through to the Grand Cavaliers, how can Long Sang? Aaron be angry with his situation? , no resentment, so he willingly became a black glove of a big man, specifically for him to deal with some things that can't be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A touch of sulphur, bloody smell, and other flavors." Aaron's nose fretting, smelling the smell of the breath, even mixed with countless sewers The smell of the dirty, stench, distinguishes the most obvious sulphur taste, bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by the power of the blood, not only the "God", but also the ability of various parts of the body, in the absence of conflict with the blood force, is very large Improvement. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Aaron was seeing that Jackson and others had not returned for a long time, and after smelling the wrong taste, they went to the sewer to explore. It was already a long time. Whether it is a corpse, ice slag caused by frost rays, or most of the taste, it is destroyed by the dark river, garbage smell, etc., and only find some less important clues, such as sulfur taste, bloody smell, and his eyes The traces of blood, brain marks, and corrosion that were deliberately cleaned were traced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a formal magician, Aaron believes that Jackson and others who add "the silver horn" of those general communicators, there is no strength to let the other side leave traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that this is more than half an hour, enough for the other party to do a lot of things, and the other is a magic apprentice, will not be to the "Silver Point" church The things I did didn't care, and Aaron's thoughts became simple: "Although you can look for the priests of the 'white horn' to cast spells to track, after a long time, the success may not be high, and the most important thing is If he has already alerted the church, the next time will be the key to whether we can escape. Is it a waste of tracking him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no difficulty in choosing this kind of thing. Longsang? Aaron can't take risks with his own life, and he is not worth the risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and wore the shoes of black leather shoes, and the whole person rushed to somewhere in the sewer like a black afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien lies in bed, pretending to sleep, high alert, listening Whether there was any inexplicable noise in the quiet night outside, until two or three hours later, I felt that the cult and the gang would not catch up, and I slept for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before asleep, Lucien has been trying to resolve the magic ring so that even if the enemy finds himself, he can have some strength to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure inside the magic ring is a three-dimensional model, but there are no complicated surfaces, curves, etc., plus the built-in construction principle is also understood by Lucien. Among them, Lucien’s time to review high school mathematics and physics appeared in this time. It took only one hour to cooperate with the calculations in the soul library, and then it was initially analyzed and tried to bring the spirit. The imprint is imprinted on the core of its magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul was created by the road, and when he was just spreading out the mental power that had already recovered, he felt that the headache was splitting, it was difficult to concentrate, and he almost failed to mark it. Fortunately, he left The spiritual imprint is much simpler than the magic of the exhibition, which is barely finished, but Lucien himself judges: "I am afraid that within two days, the magic will become very difficult, and the soul will be troubled by the creation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the spiritual mark, the information left by the manufacturer of the seal in the magic ring was obtained by Lucien:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Snow and the Avenger" ring, a magic apprentice betrayed by a friend, uses all the wealth he has acquired to revenge the revenge of a powerful alchemist. The cold touch can make people like most formal knights. Keeping awake and cold at the same time, once a day, the second ring magic 'Palmera's Ice Blade' can make the betrayers feel the pain of blood flowing and enjoy the cold of snow and ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemist did not stay His name, but provides a reason for casting and "Snow Avengers' ability rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's magical effect should be to raise the will to the level of the first-level knight, and once every second ring magic 'Palmela's ice flying Blade', according to the classification of magic items, should belong to the second-level middle. The water ghost will mutate, it seems to be mainly the role of the first magic effect." Lucien put the "ice and avenger" ring in his pocket , to ensure that you can touch at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of Lucien’s status and the fact that he can’t afford such a valuable item, it will be suspicious, and Lucien is still suffering from the soul. The state in which the mental power is difficult to spread can only be stimulated by the friction, and the magical effect of the will is to directly contact the skin to function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Lucien forced himself to wake up in a burst of headache The head is still a little dizzy, and the amount of hair is hot, it seems to be a fever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul will also cause the body to be weak and cold." Lucien sighed, strong spirits, changed another linen blouse, even If I didn't eat breakfast, I went outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is near the horizon, the sky is still dark, the cool fresh air makes Lu Xi’s spirit shocked, slightly getting rid of the uncomfortable state, and walked for about forty Minutes later, I finally saw Sir Wien’s manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Wien is a member of the Violet Knights, a second-level knight who left the Knights because of his age and is no longer stationed in the fortress near the Dark Mountains, but in Vaou When Grand Duke was the head of the Violet and the head of the Violet Knights, Sir Wien had a friendship with him, so he was often recruited into the court, and he was advised by the Dagong to consult the military situation near the Dark Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
