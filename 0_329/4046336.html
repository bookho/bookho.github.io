			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly encountering such a thing, Lucy’s hidden evil factor almost slammed and almost shouted out to serve the people as an answer, but fortunately restrained himself in time. Slightly bending over will help Polk, and the mouth is gentle: "This is what every conscience person should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage of the Holm Kingdom The fact that the husband actually does such a dramatic thing is the reason for the popular opera here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polk has no poet's cells, and it is the words "thank you", "thank you", "hope", "survival", "farmer", "bumper" and so on. After waiting for him to repeat it several times, he finally came back and hurriedly said: "Mr. Evans, please take the carriage, I am sorry to delay your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It doesn't matter, you see we are not in a hurry." Lucien looked around at random and found that many passengers getting on and off the train were watching this curiously. I don't understand why Polk made church-like worship, repentance or official glimpse of the pope. The king's etiquette, is it that the king of the country secretly visited the magic steam train? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Polk’s leadership, Lucien and Arthur boarded the carriage with the royal red badge, and Arthur’s guards followed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This country’s muddy legs have never seen the world. For a good harvest, this kind of courtesy is not given to unqualified people. Face!" Arthur thought a little annoyed, and then piled up a smile. By this, he whispered a compliment to Lucien. "Fortunately, in the platform of the Six-Star, there are fewer ordinary people who dare to approach, otherwise they will be seen." When he goes to Evans, he will be put in prison. The harvest is really the biggest hope of the farmer. Evans brings you a bumper harvest, which means becoming a harvesting angel in their minds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is like a wooden board that can look at the position of the carriage and the coachman in a perspective, and smiles: "According to some historical documents, after the creation of the Truth, The gods that follow in the human world have death, the sun, the moon, the life and the harvest (hunting), and then gradually evolve more and more different gods, and now only the dark mountains are left. More than a dozen countries in the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human worship of the gods originated in the obscurant period, and before the magicians occupied the dominant position, they died out because of the terrible environment full of horror creatures, except for legends. Only a small number of murals have been handed down, and at the same time, human beings are also in the middle and lower layers of the food chain, until some of the natural and powerful people slowly explored the ability to imitate the magical creature's pattern structure and other spells, and gradually emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years, there are no traces of gods and churches in the magical empire. To do similar research, you have to attack other intelligent races or explore different spaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the truth of the gods came to the surface, accompanied by churches that believed in other gods, they joined forces to kill the magical empire, but the truth was strengthened. The gods’ backhands were wiped out, and only some of the countries in the northwest of the Dark Mountains escaped the blow and coexisted with subtle relationships with other ethnic countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard about Lucien talking about this and using "rich" to describe the gods, Arthur did not dare to interject. Although he communicated with the magician in a bright and honest manner, and after the revision of the life god theory, he had great doubts about the church, and the faith was shaken again. But the education of the god of truth, from small to large, still left him with a lot of respect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien noticed his expression and casually transferred the topic to the mineral and harvest company, and the two sides were in a good atmosphere and talked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The place for the gala dinner was a private villa on the banks of the Velosa River in Rentart City, which was painted with fine gold, like a piece. The light-banded river, backed by the flowery natural gardens, is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa, Lucien once again saw Natasha’s prince Patrick, who was a little thinner than a year ago, not like a young man. The middle-aged man seems to be drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome back, Evans, you are much earlier than I expected." Patrick held a glass of red wine and slid on the balcony under the protection of several attendants. The cool breeze coming from the river, "I always wanted to travel around the mainland like you, go to different places, and appreciate different customs. Unfortunately, the body does not allow me to do this. Right, how is my dear niece now? Still happy? Is it a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quiet chat about Natasha, about Aalto, about travel, Patrick patted Lucien’s shoulder: “Evans, come, before the dinner, I introduce you to a few friends. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in a good state of mind today, not as coughing as he used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien moving through the banquet hall, Prince Patrick nodded to several nobles and then entered a lounge, followed by It is three well-dressed aristocrats and a middle-aged man in a black magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the king of the kingdom's finance minister, Earl of Pine." Patrick did not condescendly pointed to an old man wearing a white wig, he had a sharp Blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Duke of Wolfsburg, Russell, this is the Duke of Pefus, James, they are all members of the aristocratic parliament." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfburgshire and Pefors are the more prosperous counties of the Holm Kingdom, and the two dukes on the side of the town look like a strong man, one stays With the golden half-length hair, handsome and handsome, one looks shameful while shaving himself a shame, but according to Lu Xien, in fact, they are not young, still maintain their youthful appearance because of the strength of the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Patrick pointed a faint smile at the dark-skinned magician: "He is the Viscount Harrison of the Holm Royal Court, while It is also a member of the House of the Wizards. A member of the Aristocratic Parliament is a famous illusionist and alchemist. Should you hear about Lucien?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En gently jaw, indicating that he really heard. According to the private agreement of the church and the nobility, in the case of another heir, the magician can not inherit the title, at most become a member of the parliament at all levels, and because the "other heirs" cover a very wide range, many members of the distant family with thin blood relationship All are qualified, so basically no magician can inherit his own title, at most, he will learn magic after becoming a nobleman. Only a few lucky ones can inherit the title as a magician by chance, such as the Harry in front. Sen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even more envied by the magicians, when they inherit the title, they are only the magicians of the five rings. As a result, thanks to the wealthy property of the Viscount and their own abilities, In the fifteen years, he was promoted to a higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne heard that he was because of another thing, he actually refused to join the will of the element, but became the top of the wizard house, this pair The people of Holm Royal Devils Court are incredible things. It seems that he likes illusion over alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction of several nobles, Prince Patrick coughed a few times and smiled at them: "I think you should guess who he is, let us welcome The youngest winner of the Holm Crown Award, the genius of the Arcanist and the magician Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James is interested in the bald head The ground showed a kind smile on Lucien, and the other three nobles maintained a special restraint, just gently jaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, I admire Arthur, he actually won the cooperation with you, it is a pity that Kim Min-la is like a bag of Jintal "The Duke of James bluntly said, "I don't know what research you have recently? I think we can cooperate well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Duke of James I just finished my mission and returned to Allinge. I haven’t done any new research.” The first time I met, Lucien naturally wouldn’t be too shallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James doesn't mind, hehe smiled: "I hope there is a chance to cooperate. Yes, I recently tried a new product with Harrison. No interest in joining?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Before the call of Lucien, the Chancellor of the Treasury, the Earl of Pine, smelled a bloody shark and spoke with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison smiled with a red wine glass: "The storm dominates your electromagnetic communication is a very good thing, allowing two people to talk directly at a distant distance." Although it is very easy to be disturbed, there will be noise when it is far away, but it is enough for normal use and much cheaper than the transmission array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about it, When you are hunting in the forest, you can share the joy with friends in the city for the first time. What a wonderful thing, not to mention the application of contact and negotiation. Shorter time, faster response, Means a greater advantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
