			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five vigils stood in front of the body of the fire wolf as a statue, and the quiet atmosphere around the war was suppressed, low, and hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times and seconds pass, when the silence of the darkness seems to be unable to withstand this pressure and the explosion is about to break, the "clown" standing at the forefront does not look back. A word was squeezed out from the teeth: "Professor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language is cold and sorrowful, full of gnashing teeth and deep hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another night watchman captain "held" Salvador seems to be awakened by the clown, taking off his black gloves, his right hand draws a cross on his chest, his voice is low Grief: "Get rewards when giving, and obtain eternal life when you die. The gates of heaven will be opened for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After mourning, El Salvador will bring his own white handkerchief Take it out, attach it to the wrist, and form a sharp and heart-rending contrast with the black gloves that are re-emerged: "I will keep the tomb for you until you grasp the professor and tie him to the firearm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Knight Lund also painted the cross on the chest, then learned El Salvador, tied a white handkerchief on his wrist: "In purifying this sly, vicious evil Before the magician, I will also 'keep the tomb' for you unless I die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second vigil of the Vaurit referee team except the captain "El Salvador, the deputy captain "Hunter Knight" Lund, two strong five, There are players all off, so the two of them had planned for this event is a professor hated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana now remembers the previous battle, and her heart is full of fear. One of her companions is either silently silent in the dark, or The destruction of the powerful sorcerer can not resist, if not by luck, the two Cardinals and Ms. Camille, Princess Natasha will investigate another thing nearby, and they must also "wrap the shroud" So she hated the mysterious professor, and she had subconscious fear and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, under the stimulation of the four blood words, Juliana was infected by the atmosphere, hatred overwhelmed all other emotions, followed by the wrist system. White Handkerchief: "Professor will be the first sequence I followed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mixed... Egg!" Seeing this scene, hearing other people, clown First, I was low, then screamed. "I will never let you go. I want your soul to be bitten by the devil. I want you to fall into hell and suffer forever. The damn professor, no matter where you flee, I have to grab it by myself, tear off your mask and turn you into my beggar! I must grab you by myself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since being inspired Since the night watchman team, this time is an unprecedented failure of the clown. Although he is not so religious to the church, although he has always hated the dead vice captain and some players, the rest of the players have companions that the clown can trust. There is a "shield" that once guards his back, plus a five-level big ride. Self-confidence, face this failure have been completely destroyed, the clown could not restrain their emotions, frantically cursed "Professor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His uncontrollable performance, against the face of the always smiling clown mask, looks very strange and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other vigils understand the mood of the clown and did not interrupt his venting. Minsk also tied the white handkerchief: "I used to be close to the professor, but let He escaped and will meet again in the future. He will not be so lucky!" Although he is comparable to the second-class knight by Red Dragon scales, Longwei, Breath and black gloves, he can only rely on it. Professors who have caught at least three rings have no confidence, but this time is not a good opportunity to show fear and timidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown roared and vented, the whole person became calm and deep, and the funny smiling clown face looked at other night watchmen: "I propose to add the professor to the 'purification sequence' After all the wanted and cleansing throughout the continent, I suspect that after planning such a big conspiracy, he will soon leave Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purification sequence" is a church heresy The list of enemies listed by the referee that need to be cleaned up, the clerics and night watchmen of each parish will get a copy. Even if the person who has entered the list leaves the original place, it will be rigorously pursued and cleaned up by the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the clown’s proposal, Lund said hesitantly: “The evil people on the purification sequence are strong people who have the power to influence a country, and even have many The position is a legend that can change the situation of the mainland and the world. The professor is just a three-ring or four-ring mid-level magician. What qualifications does he have to enter the sequence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with the clown. Although the professor is not strong enough, even the high-level has not been reached, but the shackles and cruelty exceed most of the enemies, and the damage caused can be added to the 'purification sequence'. We propose to the Amorton bishop together. "The singer" Salvador nodded solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minsk and Juliana followed: "I also agree that destructive power is not just about strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The twenty-five vigils are one-third of the strength of the Alto referee, equivalent to one-twentieth of the Cavaliers of the Vaurit, and such losses can be described as disastrous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect the companions that can be found, and the five night watchers mourn again, and swear in their hearts:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must sure to catch the professor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After all the traces have been processed, Lucien will moonlight the body and wrap it around On the other side of the manor, on the edge of the Black Forest, turned into a faint afterimage, and quietly turned over the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently, without any sound, Lucien used the cover of the manor plant to quickly reach the shadow on the back of the three-story main house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was ready to climb, suddenly the heart was tight and keenly aware of a slight anomaly, so he turned without hesitation and looked nervously. The shadow next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, good evening, Lucien." In the shadow, there was no sign of a handsome man with silver and silver eyes. He didn't wear a jacket, only one. A dark red loose shirt, the buttons on the neckline are not buckled, revealing white skin, as if you are preparing to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ready to go is seeing Rhine, a little relieved, at least he is also full of secrets, if it is other people, he can only Sneak into the Black Forest and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne is still vigilantly smiling: "Hey, good evening, Mr. Rhein, haven’t you slept so late?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't slept, Lucien." Rhein looked at Lucien with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled stiffly twice: "If I said that I was awakened and saw the dreamy beauty of Silver Moon tonight, I got up for a walk and enjoy the moon. , would you believe it, Mr. Rhein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When talking, Lucien couldn’t help but look at his clothes and where he was:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close-up clothes, no jackets; standing in the shadows on the back of the manor, the silver moon is blocked; the ground is covered with moss and weeds, with several sewage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a place to enjoy the moon in such a dress, it is really a "good" excuse, Lucien himself feels too insulting other people's IQ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly believe what you said, because," Rhein spread his hands and smiled meaningfully:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said: "Where are you coming out to enjoy the moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the silver moon tonight is beautiful, the moonlight is more chaste." Rhein looked up and looked at the stone wall on the back of the main house and exclaimed, "You don't feel like walking down." ", Lucien?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the appearance of Rhein, and his expression was solemn: "Mr. Rhein, can you tell me your true Identity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have already met, it is better to take the opportunity to ask directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shook his head: "I am really a bard, it has nothing to do with the place you are looking for, and even if you tell you, you are now There is no way to break through the blockade of the church, or to improve the strength, and then open the door and try to contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Rhein, can tell Where am I? So I have the goal of struggle." Lucien asked sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
