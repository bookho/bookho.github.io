			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spells and metal collisions are gradually falling, and the four "brave" adventurers defeated the evil skeleton, unlocked the gate seal, and rushed into the magic. Inside the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, the dark magic tower is like a monster hiding quietly, waiting for the prey, and the door is its open mouth, waiting for it to "swallow After the adventurers, everything was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the terrace, with the release of the "seal", Lucien breathed the fragrant earthy fragrance of the mixed leaves and rotted, and shook his head sympathetically: "In this closed and dangerous environment, it is rare for someone to stimulate the blood or become a formal magician. Unfortunately, they are all confused by the treasures and powers in the magic tower. After secretly investigating the trap, they did not choose to retreat, but they stormed. According to the normal magician code, even if the magic tower cannot enter the inspection because of the seal, it should be thoroughly clarified by magical means such as magic pet or invisibility to initiate the attack of the surname."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lucien has no intention of escaping with the adventurer. In the case of a high-level magician watching this thing, it is best not to do anything. Trying hard does not mean Need to be reckless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Desire has both a powerful motivation and a blindness to the mind and eyes." Adam said a philosophical statement with seriousness, then laughed: "The road Sean, you are the magical powerhouse. Guess who can attack the first few layers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked back at the patio door The two young servants who did not worry at all: "We should see them soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there seems to be no fear that the two young servants will hear the truth: "If they rush to this level, then we can use their power to untie the bracelet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two young servants are fierce He glanced at Lucien, and he dared to say something to escape in front of him. However, if a prisoner did not have the idea of ​​lifting the imprisonment, it would be normal, and he would feel awkward in the case of hope. Rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least the increase in experimental materials can make us a lot easier. Materials like ours will be used more cautiously and safely. The resources of this place are Quite a lot, but most of them are in dangerous dark forests, which are not available to ordinary knights and magicians. Coupled with the witches deliberately concealing some knowledge, no one can raise the ranks, and the middle ranks are rarely. Adam smiled self-consciously and seemed to be resolving his inner pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the signs of their in-depth talk, the red-faced servant sternly said: "Shut up! Your walk tonight is over, go back to my cell with me!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Adam smiled and glanced at each other, then returned to the cell with two young servants without saying anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When they arrived at the cell, Lucien saw the four adventurers slightly sullen or fearful of being hidden in the dark by several faces. The guard in the helmet pressed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few minutes, they were caught? The old witch really does not give face! Lucien thought about it and told Adam that he had guessed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four adventurers look good, the two yellow-haired men are dressed in silver full-length armor, a middle-aged mature, a young and energetic, walking room The sound of a smashing metal crash, the two blond girls are very youthful, a dark-colored scale wearing a close-fitting body, revealing a good figure, a large red magic robe wrapped, delicate face is beautiful and moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina’s heart is walking in fear, and can’t keep the caster’s focus anymore, I thought the adventurer’s squad that brought together all the strong in the “predecessor’s notes” Under the guidance, even if he could not successfully defeat the evil witch, he also had the strength to escape from the magic tower. Even the witch had not seen it. Under the influence of the magic array, he was easily defeated by several suspected flesh-and-blood knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives her a feeling that is very different from the strength of the witch, there is no way to compete, and then think of the experience of leaving the nearby dark forest adventure several times. Carrina thought of those horrible monsters who just felt like they were pressing hard. Karena couldn’t help but raise a strong suspicion: "Are we really not strong, is it possible to defeat the witch?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, she heard a slightly sigh of laughter from the opposite side: "Man, you know better about the magician than I do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Rena looked up in the past and saw four men coming from the other side of the corridor. Two of them wore servant costumes that were seen along the way, and the remaining two were simple linens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is a tall and tough blond man, the pace is firm and steady, at first glance, it seems that there is a knight style than Alva and Brad, and he communicates. The object is a handsome young black man, the simple clothes can not cover his grace, gentle smile, deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the male pet of the witch in the magic tower?" The legend of the evil witch has been passed down from generation to generation, and has been added to all kinds of strange, horrible and The fragrant color, Carina naturally thought of a certain aspect, suddenly a little envious of the witch's life, but also more hate for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she suddenly woke up, if it was a male pet, why would she wear clothes like prisoners, and still wear a strange black bracelet that would limit their action? Especially the black-haired handsome man has a collar on his neck that makes him feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did they be former adventurers?" The eyes turned, and Karina saw the companions Ophelia, Alva and Brad around her all wondering. The expressions, from each other's tacit understanding, they think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who have just been caught are still in a state of uneasiness and ignorance. Adam, who is not used to, is so comfortable, he does not dare to be a servant and flesh. The knight's face talked with the two "predecessors", just as Lucien and Adam met for the first time. After the eyes were handed over, they were sent to the cell by flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherein Carina was on the right hand side of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the cell, Lucien found that the flesh-and-blood knights took out the black imprisoned bracelet and the banned collar for the four adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the move, Lucien’s footsteps slowed down, his eyes squinted and he watched the shackles and the forbidden collars being buckled together and began to bloom. The light works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a confirmation of the structure of the imprisoned bracelet that he has analyzed, and a preliminary peek into the forbidden collar that is temporarily inaccessible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banned magic collar was buckled around his neck, Karena suddenly felt that the mental energy of the dryness stopped recovering and could no longer perform a magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This collar has the effect of banned magic? Is that gentleman also a magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of this, she looked up and looked out the door, just colliding with Lucien's gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to feel the doubts in her heart, Lucian gently nodded and stepped up to follow the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which magician predecessor would you be?" Carina began to recall that the magicians who had disappeared in this area and were mysteriously missing were hard. Corresponding to this handsome man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this narrow, sparsely populated area, every official knight or magician is a big man, a ruler of the ruling city. Members are strong players who can be recorded in the annals of history, but they often disappear at a certain stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to this magic tower adventure, in addition to the greed inside the treasures and power, Karina and others are also to break away from the fate of destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thinking, Carina suddenly felt that flesh and blood were pulling my magic robe, so all kinds of bad associations were born, and there was nothing to do with magic. I can hurriedly punch and punch, but unfortunately, I don’t care, I just took Karina’s magic robe off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invaded by a dead body is a thing that Carina never thought of. She couldn’t help but hold her chest and curled into the corner and screamed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what made her stunned was that the flesh and blood did not continue to move, threw her a linen dress, and then picked up her magic wand, magic robe and before The removed necklace turned away and locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
