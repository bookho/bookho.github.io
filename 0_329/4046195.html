			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar originally felt that he was surprised and hit many times today, and should be numb no longer affected by similar emotions, you can hear Eric After that, he couldn't help but watch Lu Xien: "Lu Xien, you are a monster. Most of the arcane masters below the middle level have not received the manuscript of the journal. Our arcane points They all come from the audit committee's rewards, and then they are promoted by occasionally being posted several times and then slowly getting points rewards, and often they can't get seven arcane points in a few years."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have graduated from Magic School for four years, and have written more than a dozen orthopedic research papers, only through reviewing three articles, being included in an article, or in the "Arcane Discussion" Above, and the penultimate piece of that period. I only remember those talented geniuses who received invitations before the third-level Arcanists, such as Mr. Ulysses, such as Mr. Felipe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s sorrow and self-deprecation Points, similar to the half-joking manner. At least in the world of enthusiasm and kindness, Lucien felt that he was much better than Felipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s mouth moved, and he said that he had never seen the manuscript and could not say it, and he’s been alone for twenty years. One hundred arcane points become a third-level arcane master. Finally, he sighed: "'Create a surname', you can have the word 'create a surname' in the evaluation. It is no wonder that there will be a direct draft of the journal. Although Ivan Your new magic principle seems to be narrow in scope, but there are no more than ten articles in this evaluation, except for the articles of the Arcanists and high-level Arcanists."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create a surname? I understand." Lucien probably knew the important surname of the word in the paper and the new magic evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar took up the battered expression, smiled and excitedly tapped his fingers and said: "Create a surname, break the surname, extremely important surname, popular surname, Very much to discuss the surname, these five are the adjectives of the committee's highest evaluation of the paper. Of course, if your paper is evaluated as having the ability to change the times, then congratulations, Evans Arcane Master!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road to pick up the document from Eric, the jingle bell in the office rang again, and the milky white light re-covered the iron cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s face was serious and he thought to himself: “Is there something important in the parliament?” It’s less than a minute from six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is slowly calming, a document appears in the iron cage, Eric picks it up steadily and quickly, and then the expression is full of helplessness:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, the letter of the "Sonic" journal, they promised the position of the first 15 articles in the journal and can be recommended to three abstract indexed journals."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Lazar have both been numb, as long as they are not a manuscript of "Arcane" and "Magic", then "nothing". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two good journals that will also issue a manuscript at the same time." Lazar sighed with a chuckle. "Which are you going to choose? I think the "Sonic" journals are more professional in this field, and they will get more citations, and they will have better conditions than the "Organic Arcanist Monthly". Of course, there are 'creating the surname', the three Abstract indexed journals are included even if they are not recommended."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly forty journals per month, and a large part of them are repeated studies, so no one The Arcanists have a mood to read them one by one. At this time, the important surnames of the abstract indexed journals are reflected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or choose the "Organic Arcanist Monthly", at least they sent a letter of the first time, and the emphasis on me is obvious. Since the conditions are Almost, then come first and then." Lu Xiping and laughed, making decisions with the simplest reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar doesn't quite agree with: "I think..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮叮叮, The sharp voice sounded three times, Eric's face changed slightly, looking at the inactive badge that was not activated in his hand: "Evans, by six o'clock, you may have to activate tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, Mr. Eric, is there any other way? I want to go to the 'Ordinary Arcane Library' and the 'Magic Exchange Room' to see." Lucien took A little eagerly to Eric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you activate the Arcane Badge, when you reply to the manuscript, it is best to add a letter after your name according to the opinions of the gentlemen of the committee. Otherwise, it is easy to confuse the reference points. As usual, there is no need to bother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar also echoed: "The alchemy life at the parliament headquarters is very lazy." He said that while he looked at the wall, he was worried about revenge by Prosppel. "Of course, they are very hard when they are busy. Evans, let's go out for dinner. If you can't leave the parliament headquarters before half past six, you can only go to the second and nine floors to rent a meditation room to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay. Mr. Eric, let's leave." Lucien took the unactivated Arcane Badge and put it on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the "Magician Management Department" lobby, Cindy and Donna are packing up their magic notebooks and other items to leave, seeing both of them come out simultaneously Smiled: "Congratulations to Evans... Hey, Mr. Evans, your arcane badge is not excited..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hurriedly covered their mouths with their little hands, How can I ask anything if something is not good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Cindy Little Sweetheart, Donna Little Sweetheart, things are not what you think." Lazar, who felt that he occupied a unique 'news', could not bear Live to show off to the two girls, "Our dear Mr. Evans is the first person to pass the Arcane research paper review on the day of joining the Magic Council. It is the first time to publish a paper and get a 'creating a surname' rating. The person who is the first person to be contested by the two journals in the first paper..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow." "Wow." "Wow." Every time he said, Cindy and Donna felt a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-level magic apprentice, Cindy and Donna are deeply aware of how rare Lazar’s description is, until he finishes the numerous firsts, they The beautiful eyes looked at Lucien: "Mr. Evans, congratulations to the book "The History of Cindy" ('Dona's Annals'), I hope to see you earlier in the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" Article."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Cindy laughed and said: "Mr. Evans, wait for you to become a mid-level magician, don't forget us, we are still waiting to be yours. Apprentice." At this time, she said that she was a little joke, but Lucien has not passed the assessment of the basics of the Arcane. It is difficult to say the development of the arcane and magical roads in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, don't you please celebrate?" Dona took the opportunity to become familiar with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looks good, is very young, the official magician status, the evaluation of the arcane research paper is very high, gentle, calm and mysterious, such a man even Dona does not admire the mind It can be used as a magic apprentice. It is a normal idea to be familiar with getting acquainted. It may be an important personal relationship in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "If the two ladies don't mind, I want to invite you to have dinner with me and Lazar." At Ariel It is always good to have more familiar people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we are welcome. Yes, Mr. Evans, since your paper and new magic have been approved, a total of seven Arcane points have been awarded. So why didn't the Arcane badge be activated?" Cindy did not reject Lucine's invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Razard spread his hand and smiled brightly: "Because Mr. Eric was so shocked that he forgot to activate, hey, wait until he remembers, already "It’s six o'clock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha. Mr. Eric? It’s hard to imagine Mr. Eric’s stunned expression...” The girl smiled whisperingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the two ladies to pack the goods, Lazar turned his head and stared at Lucien, looking thoughtfully: "Lu Xien, you know that you got In the evaluation, what is the most embarrassing thing about me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create a surname?" Lucien asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar shakes his head and looks a bit stunned: "No, it's the 'real arcist thinking mode'. In those papers I can't pass the review. The most common ones are 'there is a problem with the way of thinking', 'strictly bad name', 'not a qualified arcane paper', etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing can change the way of thinking. If I have time, I can help Lazar to pre-examine the paper." Lucien comforted Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
