			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the stars, surrounded by countless stars, Lucien stood on the star of destiny and quietly looked at the squats that seemed to contain endless mystery. With the inexplicable winds that are rolling in, the usual quietness and calmness are a bit smug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the starry sky in front of Lucien became a scarlet, and a bright and silvery moon rose from it, piercing the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Silver Moon became a Rhine in a red shirt and black jacket, and his huge bat wings re-enclose the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your dream is exactly the same as last time, how much do you like the stars? Is this why you choose the magic of the stars?" Rhein smiled casually A few words, "Of course, I know that you actually intend to hypnotize your soul and brain before going to sleep, so that you can see what secrets are exposed in the dream. The magician is really boring, or the musicians are fun. Unfortunately, unfortunately... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his own dreams, Lucien maintains a calm and unyielding attitude: "Mr. Rhein, what did you find in the clown's dream?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhehe smiled: "Of course, I successfully completed your request. Sure enough, there were big people coming before the clown dying and wooing the remaining night watchmen. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before planning this action, Lucien had already summoned the projection of the Rhine by imprint, and let him prepare to project to the dying clown dream tonight. See everything he saw before he died. This is the real reason why Lucien repeated Natasha to let the clown dying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are really big people coming... Is it Sarder himself, or is Cardinal Amorton?" Lucien asked calmly, not inferring from himself. Correct and complacent. Of course, the main reason is that this is the dream of Lucien himself who is half-sleeping and half-hypnotic. He thinks how calm he is and how calm he is. It is the de facto dream master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine smile slowly disappeared, and the tone calmly said: "How do you guess it might be Amorton?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a faint question in his calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is no cooperation between Cardinal Serge and my 'psychology' in this incident, Natasha is difficult to put the church and the referee It is hard to push the clown to the edge of execution. Without his connivance, my strategy can't be carried out so smoothly. In this smooth, I found the cardinal Vera Amo. Always keep silent, just to convey the meaning of Thrad, it is not like a real referee giant. According to this, I judge that she also has a problem." Lucien will figure out another layer behind the suspended animation. The situation of testing Thrad is said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, the conspiracy does not necessarily need to be so complicated and sophisticated, what is needed is to grasp the opponent's thoughts and desires! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown rushed to test himself, he changed his mind, and then weaved a layer of "secret net" with the help of suspended animation, and then stepped from the church step by step. I read what I wanted to see, and tonight the Rhine projection of the clown dream is the last and necessary confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter, even if Natasha is only aware of some of the purposes of Lucien, how can the clown guess? Therefore, under the active induction of one side and the cooperation of one side, he inevitably stepped into the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein Junmei’s face reveals a faint smile: “He can’t wait to differentiate himself from the church and develop his own power with every opportunity that others can’t detect. Just like the past saints did. In the realm of the dead, obviously he knows more than me. No wonder I am trapped and he does not. However, perhaps he has another chance in it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this is a good thing for your magical assembly. If you let Sarde develop smoothly, maybe the Southern Church will split again after a few hundred years. You can use this opportunity to affirm this in advance, which is of great benefit to your choice and development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think it will Split. Sarde is not an idiot or a madman, he must understand that if it is split again, the Southern Church will no longer be able to maintain the current oppressive situation, and the places that can be controlled will be greatly reduced. Whatever the purpose of Sarde , controlling the sharp decline in the number of wealth and believers, He is definitely not a good thing. His choice should be like a parasite to smash the essence of the tree in the church, and gradually grow up until there is a glimpse, for example, when the pope is replaced, the epidermis is replaced. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein stunned: "As the level of magic grows, Lucien is getting smarter, more mature, and more and more aware of the big picture. Oh, but I still think that the young boy is more interesting. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he talked about what the clown dreams saw, and finally confirmed that the clown had died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was relieved at this time, because it was risky to let the clown dying away, and if Sarde personally shot it, it is not a small possibility. Saved back, and when you become more and more famous in the Magic Council, when you board the purification sequence in the original identity, it is difficult to ensure that the crazy clown will not do anything to his friends and relatives. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although if the clown survives and is discovered by other night keeper or aristocrats, it is easy to reveal the strangeness of the Vaolirit diocese Will not save the clown, whether he himself or the spokesperson, will deliberately be late for a while, but things are not absolute, and Sarde’s mind is not completely speculative, in case he thinks the clown is a personal talent, Can you send someone else to do secret things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after hearing the death of the Clown confirming the clown, Lucien finally let go of his heart, and then the funeral ceremony of the big musicians that he did not have to attend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Awakened from the dream, the moonlight outside the window is still cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening his eyes, Lucien thought of the grief and reaction of his relatives and friends after his death, and he was very embarrassed and painful - in order to ensure the funeral Feelings and their own safety, we must wait until everything is over and we are about to leave Aalto before we can tell Uncle Joel what they are still alive and why they made this choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make them suffer for a few days of suffering, so that Lucien is now a little bit sympathetic, so the low mood completely offsets the joy of planning success, and it is difficult to calm down on the reverse side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the War Gallery is a private palace of Natasha and has the protection of Camille, Lucien is not worried about getting out of bed and going to the window, quiet Jingyue looked at the ancient silver moon, trying to calm down the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't sleep?" On such a quiet night, Natasha's voice was soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head and saw her strolling in the garden under the moonlight. The pieces of violets and lilies are irritated at the same time under the effect of the magical array. They are beautiful and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, when I think of Uncle Joel and Teacher Victor, they know the reaction after my 'death', my mood is very messy, very painful, I want tonight. Just tell them the truth." Lucien said without concealing, the heart has a desire to confide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha waved out that Lucien came out, and he took a picture of the railing in the corridor next to the garden, and there was no princess sitting on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not clean, so he did not mind sitting on the railings around Natasha, smelling a quiet and refreshing taste. She doesn't like to paint a lot of cosmetics like most aristocratic ladies, and the body of the Knights has lost a lot of impurities, and the body is clean and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I understand your pain, just like when I was sadly worried about him in front of my father. No, not the same, he just Worried, my mood is very bad, and until dawn, your uncle Joel will have more pain than worry, your mood is definitely much worse than before." Natasha comforted the surname and took the road Sean’s shoulder, “But we can’t let emotions affect our judgment. If we make a decision, we must implement it firmly. This may be very cold, but the result is the best.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weakness, feelings, hesitation, etc. can neither save ourselves nor save the people we want to guard. As I said before, cruelty is also gentle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently: "I understand that I have always understood and firmly done it, but the pain and sentiment in my heart will not be reduced by half. I feel the bites of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, out with it, that would feel better. As good as this, lest you embarrassment and fairness, we exchange sad thing. "Said Natasha very generous attempts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
