			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the "ice of the ice", "the eye of the curse" and the "death lord" Tananos stand in a triangle, their The Central is the "heart of time" Ketonia, which is no longer so arrogant, and the mature man Hoffenberg with a pair of cold silver eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two epic knights did not hold their own swords, empty their hands and float there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time is almost up, I will lie to the defense." Hoffenberg looked up and saw the clear and clear stars, not humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of the Curse" Atlante closed his eyes and smiled: "Thank you for your cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hofenberg is different from Ketonia, and is not controlled by the curse of the "death lord", and the strength is almost peak, belonging to the collaborators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hofenberg’s body sank and turned into a silver-gray sword light, and the sound remained at high altitude: “Action begins!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice just fell, Ketonia’s body suddenly smashed into a wavy light, revealing a silver-gray sword in the inside, violently attacking, screaming “ice witch "! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hofenberg's "Sword of Truth" is actually in his hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ice Witch" is too late to defend, only to have a trigger-type, passive defense and flash effect, but the silver-gray swordsmanship is like a skeleton. The lingering, the layer of spell defenses opened, the effect of the space transfer was shattered, and the "ice witch" was directly hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do everything, the sword of truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia is completely disregarding, without leaving a little defense to protect itself, it seems that the "death lord" and "curse of the eye" next to it do not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, there are only "ice witches" in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Death Lord" watched this scene. It didn't work because he seemed to have been moved to another world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver gray sword light passed by, "ice witch" ice crystal carved body was broken and broken by countless illusory cracks, turned into countless pieces flying. Snow fell leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ice Witch" is dying and can't believe that "The Heart of Time" Ketonia will attack himself because he was captured before and was "dead lord" Planted a terrible curse, and once there was a behavior that harmed himself and others, he immediately died of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of this curse comes from the legendary peak nature of the "Death Lord" and belongs to the most mysterious kind of magic. Therefore, even the gods such as "Lord of Hell" and "God of the Silver Moon" can hardly unravel without causing the attention of the "death lord" unless there is a magical class of the god level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is impossible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a magician has not yet been born! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowflake dissipates, "ice witch" 陨. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hofenberg's silver ash flies halfway, a leisurely fold, through the heavy time and space, flashing in front of the "curse of the eye". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Eye of the Curse" Atlante had already reacted when the "Ice of the Ice" was attacked, but he did not rescue. Instead, he directly casts a spell to escape. Therefore, when Hoffenberg's own silver-gray glows in him, only one scream is transmitted through layers of time and space, and the best results are not achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Escape very fast..." Hoffenberg said coldly, not immediately chasing him. Instead, he turned his attention to the "death lord" Tananos, and said in his heart: "Don't blame me, blame only Alto's defeat, you have no hope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is more than half an hour ago, the intelligence determines his choice, and the legendary magicians, although often maintaining communication, do not have the ability to build sound transmission arrays everywhere, can only pass half a time at a fixed time Face exchange messages, and in the fierce battle, Alto's legendary magicians have free to give this information! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the height of Cux, a man wearing a sacred crown. The middle-aged man holding the Platinum Scepter came out and said calmly: "You should be honored. The Lord asked me to give up chasing dark creatures and make a special trip to execute you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A legendary magician, a necromancer who has had thousands of years of legendary experience, is absolutely horrible, even if Dracula and Danisos dare not say that they must be more than "death lords" Strong, even if the means are different, mysterious and changeable, survivability, and many means of resurrection, "death lords" can marry them a few streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death lord" Tananos looked at Pope Gregory in front of him and suddenly asked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse planted in Ketonia was strangely cracked, making him aware of something wrong, and thus discovering the Pope’s My own weak familiarity, that is the similar feeling that he once felt in a legendary magician many years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s power range, the sound can not be leaked, he slightly raised his head, slightly arrogant: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not worth knowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Platinum scepter lifted, Heaven Mountain projection emerged, "You are one, also 10,000" voice echoes In the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow that suddenly fell in the air made the old fox Anord feel tight. A bad foreboding is reflected in the heart through the "Fate of Death". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flee!" he snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the swamp, a golden knight, a knight rides in a elemental, actinic manner, in the direction of Cux, one by one cardinal The protection of the Holy Light is coming, and in the darkness, the vigils are ecstatic, and they are constantly harvesting their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returning Congers, Nelson, Plyhill, Fernando, and other great mages, high-level magicians, although they don’t understand what happened, but Still began to desperately, all kinds of spells broke out, and also strangled the enemy. At the same time, they did not have the entanglement of thoughts. Once they saw the opportunity, they immediately started life-saving magic. Even if they committed suicide, they must flee here for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation was very tragic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old fox Annor searched for the whereabouts of Plyhill and Fernando, and tried to help them before they escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Ketonia in the sky saw him, his eyes slammed, his right hand slammed, and the "sword of truth" turned into streamer. Breaking through the layers of time and space, I fell on Arnold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The strength is too low to dare to mix this kind of thing? Empty is smart equal to zero." He faintly sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the spell on Anord is also smashed by layers in the future, and the sword light flies through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The icy tingling numbs the soul of Anord, letting him subconsciously turn to look at Rentat. Confusedly thought: "Is I finally dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Old fox!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the injury, it was difficult to fight to the edge of the encirclement, and Fernando, who was about to use the "chaotic transmission", could not believe the old fox was stunned by the silver ash sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his mind, the old fox is an extremely elder old man, no matter what he says, he may hide his conspiracy. Never panic, everything is under control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouldn’t there be more means and more reinforcements? How could it die like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dagger quietly stabbed out of the darkness and tied to Fernando's vest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sat in the middle of the square in a dull, thinking about the crucial issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a busy day, he looked up tiredly and looked at the magicians who stayed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, several children ran and played, and accidentally took the apple out of their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple draws a parabola. Unstoppable to the square ground<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arc is like a flash of lightning across Douglas’s mind, illuminating the entire darkness, the points accumulated in the past The moment I dripped out an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The law of celestial bodies works like this!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is madly picking up the quill in his hand and writing on the parchment next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical flame of the whole Aringe was suddenly extinguished, and the roar of the roaring sound came from the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left-behind magicians face each other and are completely unclear about what has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near Lentart. It was at night that the darkness was shrouded, and an incandescent sun could hang high in the air, emitting light and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind it, a vast expanse of the universe, the stars are moving in accordance with the obvious and mysterious rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The defending knights who had not slept were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dying Anord suddenly sees the direction of Renthal Raising a round of the sun, in stark contrast to the darkness here, so the corner of the mouth is difficult to pull a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it illusory?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or is he really successful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a touch of relief, being swayed by the sword of truth Jianguang tore into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando also saw this scene and tried to control the effects of the coma that was not attached to the beheading. Then disappear through the "chaotic transmission" in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lentart is bright? Douglas's cognitive world is semi-cured? 'Real World' feedback?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is his last thought before waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the "Critical Wind" of the Epic of Kukes joined the battlefield and intercepted others who tried to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light of the ocean engulfed the sky, and the "death lord" Tananos body was a little transparent and difficult to reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sensed the changes in Rentat. Slightly smiled and said: "The inheritance of magic, forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Gregory seems to be twenty years old and his hair is grayed out. He looked at Rentatt's "Sun" and coughed a sigh: "It's just a semi-solidification of the cognitive world, at best a new legend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After "God Drop", he was quiet and didn't want to do it any more, so he told Hoffenberg to say, "You go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One familiar person fell, the old fox's blood splashed on his face, the darkness was full of enemies, and could not escape.... Fernando had a nightmare I woke up and felt pain in my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Someone around me snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at it and found himself in a spacious carriage, the car was running smoothly, I couldn’t feel a little bump, and in the carriage, one The beautiful girl looked at herself with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
