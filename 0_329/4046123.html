			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy sweet and sweet flowers, slightly muddy earthy, slightly cold night breeze seems to be quickly removed from Lucien’s side, surrounded by All that is left is the brightly flashing starry sky, and the beautiful silver moon that did not cover up the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reflection in the soul and the connection of the main star of destiny once again emerged, hunger and thirst to take the power of the main star of fate and integrate into itself, blooming a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fusion of star power, Lucien’s soul seems to have changed, and then slowly began to condense into “substance”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when Lucien opened his eyes, the pupil was like a dream full of countless stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close and open again, the eyes return to normal, Lucian feels the spirit is unprecedented, the soul has a clear improvement, as if condensed some tiny Things are like the dust of grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the composition of the soul? Is it a special element or a uniquely composed wave field? What is the enhancement of meditation?" Lucien is very changing about the soul. Interested, but limited by the insufficiency of its own knowledge and materials, can only guess out of thin air, "but only the soul has undergone such a change, in order to construct a spell model in it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a high-level magic apprentice, Lucien turned all his attention and goals to the official magician. In this world, only when this level is reached is the level of power that is beyond the ordinary people. A good strength, like a knight who inspires blood power, can also gain the status and identity corresponding to strength. This is not like the existence of musicians, but more because of the preferences of clergy and aristocrats. If one day they abandon music, the status of musicians will be greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Because Natasha had told the officials of the City Hall before leaving Aalto, and because of the identity of the famous musician of Lucien, When the documents such as "documents" and "certificate documents" were legally far-reaching, Lucien only spent half a day, and normally it took seven miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many adventurers can travel around without such an instrument, they will be compared when checking for strict border fortresses, cities, or when someone is looking for trouble. Danger, it may be used as a heresy by the church, and it is used as a spy by the intelligence department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Lucien continued to stay in Aalto, planning the route and accompanying Joel on the one hand, and waiting for the April 10th approach on the other. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of April 9th, bid farewell to Joel, John, Elena and others who were off the road. Lucien sat on a long-distance carriage hired by the association. Alto was heading northwest, using the excuse to go to the province of Tilan in the north of the Principality and then to the ancient kingdom of Syria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The magnificent Aalto City is gradually disappearing behind, Lucien will take his head back into the window and pick up his identity documents, etc. Look through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of these documents, there are magical marks to ensure that they are not forged by people outside the church, so it is a very powerful proof, don’t worry about going to the east of the mainland. It is impossible to pass the border and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning over, Lucien suddenly found several newspapers in the carriage, so he curiously picked it up and took a closer look. It was only after the festival. Published "Music Review" and "Symbol Guide". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Elena thinking that I didn't see it, so I bought it in the car and let me pass the time?" Lucien decided to put the newspaper a little back. People, this time, in addition to the documents required to prove the documents, the basics have not been to the association, naturally have not seen these newspapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first edition of "Music Review" is divided into two halves. The left side is painted in black and white with Christopher’s curtain call, and the right side is colored oil painting. I painted Lu Xien playing the side of the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two lines of words are very large and very symmetrical:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End, the beginning of an era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the second edition is the full text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The past seventy years have been an era in which symphony development has begun to improve and its structure has become rigorous. It is an era in which the symphony is rapidly brilliant and dominates the stage of elegance. Mr. Christopher is the epitome of this era and is the true master of music. Let us thank the masters and the tribute to this era with the most solemn etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to go through the honors Mr. Christopher received, This article will become very lengthy. I just want to emphasize that the final "Twilight Wars" symphony is an unprecedented attempt by the masters. It has broken through the limitations of the past, has won great success, and shows us the future. It belongs to the trend of the theme music. And when Mr. Christopher wrote this piece of music, it was already 70 years old, which made me think of a sentence, the heart of music will never stop beating."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to the Lord for our gifts, miraculous artifacts will preserve these classics for us, we will be able to enjoy in the music library They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."This is also the beginning of an era, although the conductor and performance of Mr. Lucian Evans is still very young, there are still many The problem, but he showed us the new development of music, whether it is his symphony, sonata, or command, piano playing, etc. are full of revolutionary taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of change may not be accepted and liked by many gentlemen, but I think it would be too appropriate to start a new era in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The new symphony connotation, the new sonata structure, the new command style, the new playing fingering, the new form of concert, I can already imagine the gorgeous and colorful future, this will be an era of change." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Thanks to Mr. Lucian Evans, thanking this unconstrained musical genius, he is the beginning of this era, and I wish him all the best The epitome of this era has become the legend of music and ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Christopher has closed the curtain, Mr. Lucian Evans has begun, and music never ends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is not signed, representing a joint article by the Aalto Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the first and second editions of the Symphony Herald are similar to the Music Review, which is a review and evaluation of the two-day concert. The aspect is the beauty of Christopher, on the other hand is the praise of Lucien, such as: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a new concert Mr. Lucian Evans showed us a completely different form of sonata, conductor style and performance, let us know for the first time that piano solo has such charm. I think no one should mind that I call piano "The king of musical instruments?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... "We want to thank ourselves for living in this era, this genius will not wait until death is discovered and accepted, Thanks to the Lord, thank you to Mr. Lucian Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the beginning, freely flipped through the back article, except for Christopher Most of the praises are consistent with the connotation and structural form of the Sonata of "Sorrow". Affirmation of the style of innovation, the affirmation of the piano fingering and performance charm, only a small part of the evaluation of Lucien's command is like a madman, a patient, Lucian's playing is like a piano without elegant temperament . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this few articles, Lucien saw Wolfe’s name, and it seems that he can only be a critic and he still remembers himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the newspaper, Lucien looked at the title of the music comment in a daze:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An era The end of an era, the beginning of an era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The life of the musician Lutheran is over, can the life of the magician Lucien really start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the car window, a country house quickly flies backwards and disappears, the road is gradually deserted, and the trees are getting denser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At 6 pm on April 9th, the long-distance carriage arrived at the town of Massawa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is the road to the north, to the north is the province of Tilan, one of the direct areas of the Violet family, and two hours west is the shore of Lake Elsinore. "Bonn" town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
