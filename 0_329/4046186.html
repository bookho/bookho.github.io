			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, Jacques seems to hear someone breathing heavily in his ear, so it’s so close to one’s own heartbeat: “This is me. Is the breathing sound? Is it that I can't resist the devil's temptation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heavy breathing, after a few seconds, Jacques exhausted his whole body With a hoarse voice that seems to come from another world: "I, what do I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he has split into two parts, some of which are full Desire, completely overwhelmed by the tide of love, part of watching, blaming but unable to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Jacques, you only need to sign a magic contract with me, not revealing my identity, turning a blind eye to the abnormalities found during the inspection, on the vessel After sailing and returning to Sturk, I don’t try to sell us...” Lucien still maintains an elegant smile and absolute alert. The knight attendant with faith often swears at the critical moment of the matter, “and I promise you when you are three. When you can't rely on your own strength to become a knight, you can provide medicines that stimulate your blood. Even if you can't find me, the Magic Council will help you to do so. This can be done by Mr. Tom on behalf of the Parliament."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucien added: "We can also add to the magic contract: as long as it does not endanger our lives, we will not hurt this sailboat. You and your companions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques gasped for a few times, looked up and looked at Lucien’s eyes: "Okay, you win Cheryl is my biggest weakness."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words are spoken, he feels that there is something in his heart that is broken, but after making a decision, the contradiction is hesitant, embarrassed, hopeful and unwilling to accept. Complex emotions are completely gone, and the whole person is in a strange state of relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Mr. Jacques, you made the right choice, I think your future is definitely bright." Lucien smiled while Use your right hand to take out the prepared parchment from your arms, then hand it to Jacques, and take out the quill and "magic ink" from your pocket, write it on the fly, and write it in the mysterious magic contract format. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When writing, Lucien did not look at the parchment, but kept staring at Jacques, and his left hand did not relax at all, and continued to hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques did not care, looked down at the parchment in his hand, slightly bitterly said: "I have seen my future, it is a dark future. Violation With the belief and the knight spirit, it is difficult for me to stimulate the blood power by myself, and it is difficult to improve with the pharmacy, let alone the difficulty of crossing the big knight. But as long as there is Cherie, even the abyss, I will not hesitate. Jumping down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Jacques, you are a good lover, I am sincerely admired." Lucien said while writing, laughing. "And as far as I know, obeying the knightly spirit is to find your own path, to unite the will, and then to stimulate the blood through the will. What is your path? Is it guarding Miss Cherie, guarding her own love? Are you willing to abandon everything and accept the temptation of the devil? If you can, then I think you can also stimulate your blood by your own will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack surprised Look at Lucien: "Mystery Magician, you and my knight teacher very different opinions stimulate blood of power, but it seems some truth. "Tom the same strange and surprised, I did not expect to Lucien Knight also has an unusual way of understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know a few high-ranking knights..." Lucien vaguely replied that it is impossible to say that he is from the words that Natasha occasionally mentioned. To sum it up, "And in today's mainland, science, sorrow, and magic research are advancing by leaps and bounds. Even if Mr. Jacques is motivated by drugs, it is not a dead end. Maybe after a few years or more, after a few years, Have a magician develop a better formula that will help you make up the foundation and continue to advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucien feather pen waved a few times At the end of the contract, sign your name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, Jacques certainly wants to hear words that enhance his confidence, so for the first time, he smiled: "I heard that the holy water of the church matches the secrets of the noble family. Pharmacy, the highest can be promoted to the second-level knight, such as the Grand Duke of Vaolirit. After the pharmaceutical formula, maybe there is hope that the magician Mr. you mentioned the breakthrough. Hey, Lucien Evans, hehe Are you the same name as Chery's favorite genius musician? But he is a warrior who never compromises for the dark, and you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Lu Xien laughed twice, the magic contract does not have a real name. At the same time, he turned his head and looked at Tom a little. Didn't he know that he had guessed his identity? The name of Evans that I used to use only before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Granny is here, think of Grace to help people hand in the paper, think of the guy who found out that he was secretly called Lucien? Evans, thinking of Grace as a student of a talented musician, I am sure that the guy in front of him is the famous musician, but he doesn't know if he has mentioned the paper that Grant has helped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom stuck in the doorway still staring at Lucien’s left hand and Jacques, ready to burst blood, for the same name and the same name seems to see too much So there is no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques looked at the contract several times and confirmed that there was no problem, then took Lucien’s feather pen and signed his name “Jacques? Wichi” in the lower right corner. "Mr. Evans, is that okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, let Tom also name the name, and then took the magic contract in hand. In the spirit, the spirit spreads to completely wrap it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of magical fluctuations appear in the text on the parchment, turning into a light blue flame that slowly burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are not casting their own spells, Lucien can use mental power to suppress the magical fluctuations, watching the parchment turn into ashes in the light blue flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was completely burned, Lucien suddenly felt that there was something invisible in the soul, and Jacques’s expression became slightly awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sign of the establishment of the magic contract! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract is established. If there is a violation, it will be destroyed by the magical flame to destroy the soul." Lucian smiled and extended his right hand and shook it with Jacques, as if Celebrate the success of the cooperation. "Then we will not bother Mr. Jacques to check the magical array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques looked at Lucien deeply: "Evans Sir, I have to say that you are a real devil, a devil who is good at deceiving people. When I was trained by the Cavaliers, I always thought that I could face the devil without being tempted, but now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish over and went to check the deck next to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Tom watched him at the door and did his work seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the magic contract really violates, there is no possibility of being suppressed by the magic, Evans, you are not afraid?" Tom whispered. He understands that the magic contract is not stable. For example, Lu Xien, as long as he is promoted to the middle level, he can rely on the strength of the soul to resist the soul fire damage brought by the magic contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice replied insignificantly: “The magic contract is just a form. When he decides to sign, I have a great grasp that he will not violate it. As long as the people's heart is 'fallen', it will be difficult to face the 'brightness', and it will only get deeper and deeper. Of course, there are certainly risks, but it is much less risky than risk-taking magic, so in terms of probability, I can only choose the former. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good thoughts. I heard that there is a half-elf pastor who believes in the goddess of fortune. Every time I make a decision, I will throw coins and throw what is What.” Tom nodded and smiled. “The magic potion is coming out of the parliament. After all, you have protected so many apprentices.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in Lucien and Tom Under the "accompaniment", Jacques checked the cabins here and turned a blind eye to the apprentices trying to hide in the narrow rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jacques left, after a whole hour, nothing happened. Lucien had a long sigh of relief, and it seems that he will not take the risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The cabin of Viscount Wright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expensive Caullet Kingdom porcelain cup was heavily thrown onto the carpet and dull into countless pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste, you are all waste, even let the fishermen take away so many sea stones, and almost let people find those guys." Viscount Wright Roaring angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
