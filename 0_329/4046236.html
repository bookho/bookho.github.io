			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay and Walter are both devout monks, and then joined the night watchman for other reasons. Currently one is the Holm Diocese The captain of the fifth night watchman squad, one is the member of the "Magician's Hammer" night watchman squad of the Holy City Lance referee. They are all five-level bishops, and their beliefs are particularly fanatical and determined. They left a deep impression on the leader of the monk monk in Warren Hill, so they were asked to perform this almost mortal task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walun Hill, I am always ready for the Lord's dedication. Death is not over, the parade of Heaven Hill will be an eternal paradise." Gula squatted on one knee and painted a cross on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a tough, cold middle-aged man, dressed in a simple white robe, without a wife, without children, without family, without pleasure, everything Dedicated to the God of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter is a young, dark-haired man with a blue eyes full of vicissitudes: "Wallen Hill, death is not terrible, terrible It is the loss of the whole body of the Lord, which will live in the hell that will never be released. The Lord is omnipotent, the Lord creates everything, and death is nothing but His embrace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very good, your devotion to the Lord is your noblest character. I can feel the joy of the Lord. The gates of Heaven Mountain will always be open to you. If you can return this mission, I will take you there. The holy city of Lance accepts the blessing of the pope, allowing you to ascend to the higher order and become the cardinal who presides over a small parish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valen Hill is two The steadfast belief of the night watchman was touched by his own praise. "Your goal is to rise to the 91st in the purification sequence, Felipe Carneiro. In addition, you have a secondary. Goal, he is Lucien Evans? X, but important to the former The surname cannot be compared. If there is no chance, don't destroy the action of purifying the gods. If you have the possibility of fleeing, don't give up because of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp That is to say, in the occasion of the Archmage and high-level magicians, the possible surname of the assassination of Lucien is almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods must clear!" Nikolay and Valent answered loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Baha'u'llah solemnly took out a silver-gray sword, which looks ordinary at first glance, but when you look closely, you will find that it seems to absorb all the light. It is possible to open everything: "This is a replica of the power separated by the artifact of the Holm parish's "Sword of Truth", which can break through all the constraints and connections below the legend. Felipe is the Necromancer He may have his own life, soul, etc. Only use this kind of item to thoroughly purify him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hoffenberg family's blood is named The "sword of truth" is because their power is similar to this artifact. It’s just that this legendary item can’t be brought to the two night watchers, or it’s not clear whether it’s going to kill Felipe or send legendary equipment, so the church’s three cardinal members of the Holy Order (legendary) spend In a few days, the power of the separation of the "Sword of Truth" combined with his own strength, the divine array, the high-order materials, etc., condensed the copy and was able to be used once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Nicholas’s takeover of the “Sword of Truth”, Warren Hill said: “The old Master Fern will arrange for you to enter Sariva. Manor as a waiter, you wait patiently, can't be eager, and must remove Felipe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Master Fern is a 4th-level Arcanist, 5 The magician of the ring, there have been many influential arcane research results, and the fighting power in youth is amazing, killing many night watchers, but with the increase of age and the slowdown of strength growth and even stagnation, He began to be confused in arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where does life come from?", "What is the source of magical power", and "how the original soul is produced" is deeply troubled by him. It is impossible to get an answer from the existing arcane research, so I gradually believe in the existence of God. I believe that God is the first, that is, one is the master, and the faith is abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the arranger directly sneaked into the manor where the high-ranking magicians gathered, assassinating the magical parliament’s most highly regarded genius action, only he promised it, those who are due to money, Materials, beauty, and other guilts who cooperate with the church are totally unwilling to cooperate. If they are urgent, they will be honest with the "discipline department" affiliated with the "committee". After all, accepting the corresponding punishment is better than losing their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay and Valent stood up and sang the cross while painting the cross: "On the truth forever!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bahá'u'lláh sighed and said, "Would you sacrifice the two devouts to such a level of the night watchman? And the magician of the old Master Fern wants to develop very difficult. After this incident, our loss will be It’s a shame, it’s a pity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But everything is worth it. Can’t describe it with sacrifice, it’s dedication, the most pious to them. Good expression." Valent Hill, the leader of the monk, closed his eyes and his face was firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Good afternoon, Mr. Felipe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Felipe Mr...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the Sariva Manor, a nephew middle-level arcane master saw his hands in a black windbreaker and walked alone. After Lipe, they all subconsciously nodded and said, there seems to be a kind of admiration from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to win another prize after winning the Immortal Throne Award, may even win the Holm Crown Award, in addition to the Arcane Master, Legendary Magic Teachers, only Felipe. In addition, although his research on cell memory surnames has opened a new chapter in the treatment of injuries by Necromancer, which has benefited many magicians, this is only a complementary and breakthrough arcane achievement. Did not overthrow the human life mechanics, saying that one of the cornerstones of this necromantic magic is so shocking, so look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the eyes are full of grievances, and there are many necromancers who want to refine Felipe into their own bodies. Basically, I admire deeply regretted. Why isn’t the magician of the elemental system getting the research results of subversion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with all sorts of eyes, Felipe was calm and self-satisfied, without a little bit of modesty and without fear, all received, and the slight jaws responded to the big step into the manor. Go to the main house hall. In front of him is a high-level arcane master such as Rogerio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the door of the main house, Felipe paused for a moment and looked at Lucien, who came out of another house. , showing a gloomy smile, as if to say "the beauty of the cooperation, Professor Mr.."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no Necromancer can meditate because he cannot accept the new theory. The headshot died, but due to the confusion of the cognitive world, there are not a few mentally uncontrollable injuries, and the old guys who are stubborn conservatives are the main ones, so Felipe is very satisfied with the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he didn’t wait for Lucien’s reaction, went straight into the main house hall, and accidentally saw a half-height platform in front of it, with many dangerous magic The experimental package made of alchemy platform and glass is placed in the array package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crystal clear tube allows two glass bottles to form a closed loop system with other devices in between, giving a strange and mysterious aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this experiment?" Felipe said with a slight astonishment, thinking that it was to discuss the study of alchemicals to promote food production. It doesn't look like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do people with the will of the element want to do?" It is the core of the pale hands, and Felipe, who believes that they will not take advantage of this kind of thing, will soon The arcane master who associates with the elemental will, with deep suspicion, sits in the middle of the row of seats behind Rogerio, Pesor and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Pesoul, what is this?" Rogerio thought about it, no clue, so he asked sideways as a member of the Arcane Board. Pesor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesol shook his head: "I don't know. The discussion at the end of this project was proposed by Gaston, and they completed any meaningful experiments. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't pay much attention to it, anyway, the theory of human life mechanics has been overthrown by the pale hand, and there is enough time to buffer, what is there? Determining the results of the surnames will not make the pale hands suffer more serious losses. At the most, the die-hards who are confused and the progress may slow down a lot will be hit harder, and the strength will become slower and even stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other basic theories of the Necromancer, there is currently no indication that they are wrong. If they can be overthrown, they can almost be considered to have entered the realm of God, such as "The essence of the soul", "soul - consciousness - the theory of the self" and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien and the Arvinist of Lavendi, Gaston, Locklini and other elements of the will also came in and sat on the other side. The location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
