			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Narrow, crowded, only with wooden tables and wooden chairs, it is difficult to get in and out of the home of Eliza, and Lucien and John sit tight On the two chairs next to each other, whispered a conversation about the annihilation of the cult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Joel also played on the streets of the administrative district, and Ai Wen played nearby with friends of the same age, while Alice Da was preparing dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Wien told me that there may be a knight whose identity is not low, so we went to the sewer and found only one of the devil's believers. In the Great Chamber, they actually built a devil's hall there!" John said solemnly. "And the devil believers are all missing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi I don’t have much surprise about this result. After killing the old man of the cult, I went to tell John all night. For such a long time, if the cult seniors have not found the disappearance of the subordinates, this poor vigilance And IQ, they still don’t want to do the dangerous work of cults. It’s better for them to go home to grow oats: “What about the Aaron gang?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gangs including Longsang Aaron, the main leader also disappeared, and the ordinary gangsters who caught them did not know the things of the devil believers. The judges of the heresy referee mixed the interrogation skills of the gods, and rarely made mistakes." John's golden eyebrows wrinkled Come, "But these ordinary guys, I am afraid I have been secretly executed now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has always been so tough and involved in matters involving cults and devils. ruthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the magician, Lucien felt that the attitude of the church seemed to be softer, such as when the "self" was not secretly executed, of course, it may be with the witch. Magic apprentices are not concerned about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the religious book in the music library in the past two days, there is a book called "The Sorcerer's Skull" written in the sacred In 392, 423 years ago, it was the work of a famous referee of the heresy, mainly teaching the wizard hunters, the night watchers how to identify the magician, tracking the magician, and how to torture the magician. There are a few interesting and cruel words: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to identify a magician in the case where the use of divine secret detection is undetermined?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the suspected person lives a hidden and lonely life, then this of course proves that he is a magician; if the suspected person often attends the banquet, warm and cheerful, then he is obviously camouflaged In order to transfer the suspicions of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is afraid of knowing your hunter or night watchman identity, then it must be a magician if he remains calm , then he is undoubtedly a magician, because the magicians Yu Yu lays lie and hides shamelessly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When catching doubters, and When you interrogate him, if you find that your magic can't see through his true face, you can try the following method: If he turns his eyes when he is punished, it means that he is using his eyes to find the source of his power, that is, the devil. And if his eyes are sluggish and not moving, it means that he has seen the devil. If he has the strength to stand the torture, it means that the devil can support him, so he must be tortured more severely; if he endures If you don't live, you will be mad at the penalty, which means that the devil will let him die, so that he will not confess and not reveal the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When all cannot be confirmed Give the final judgment to our strict, fair, truth-monitoring God, and tie the suspected magician to the firearm. If the Lord thinks he is not an evil magician, then he will Will be safe in the flames if he is burned to ashes There is no doubt that he is an evil magician, this is the will of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing this religious classic more than four hundred years ago, Lucien found It’s such a lucky thing to be alive. “Maybe the church has been so powerful for so many years, now that the wizards have been relaxed. It seems that they have focused their attention on the heresy of the North.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find in the temple? Lucien asked John with some curiosity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John seems to recall something unpleasant, his expression becomes very serious and hateful: "We knights The attendants were only kept outside the main hall. The deep things were represented by Sir Wien, the Earl of Verdi, and the Cardinal of Salvator, who led the knights and pastors. Later, Sir Wien also Didn't tell us what he saw in it, but his expression has been very dignified since it started. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, I only knew the story of the bard, the description of Sir Wien, the cruelty and horror of the devil and the evil spirits. There was no such thing as hatred from them. But the first time I saw them directly on the day. After the scene, I realized that they are so evil, bloody, cruel, and tyrannical, that I hate from the heart, want to kill them, and want to completely remove them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing John's serious but powerful tone of strength, Lucien smiled: "John, have you found your own justice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp John nodded and shook his head: "It is a matter of years or even decades to measure whether it is your own justice. It is just more than the belief of protecting the homeland and guarding friends. It is a very strong idea to get rid of the evil creatures, demons and other evil creatures and their followers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that there is a special profession in the knight, called For the 'Devil Hunter', they walked in the dark all year round. In order to get rid of evil creatures and risk your life, isn't John wanting to develop in this area?" Lucien opened John's joke. "Right, Sir Wien is ready to reward you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John eased his expression and smiled: "It is so easy to stimulate blood power. Look at the number of knights in the entire Principality. As for the future, join the Knights or become ' The Devil Hunter' is still too far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said: "Sir Wien intends to reward us with a few knights who are obliged to wear a steel forged sword. A long sword that can be taken home by yourself, hehe, the one who is going to give it to me, Sir Wien said, will have some magical power, will be sharper, only a little worse than the official knight sword." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When mentioning the long-awaited sword, John actually smirked a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked for a while. When Joel returned, John cleverly stopped the topic, but in the end reminded Lucien: "I am from Sir Wien heard that the entire Aalto will be relaxed on the surface, and secretly strengthen investigation and alert. Lucien you have had contact with the witch, you must not run around during this time, lest you be defamed to become a music student of Mr. Victor. "The people are falling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, John." Lucien knows that this is a very valuable message, and John is willing to disclose it to himself, and he has already violated him. The suspicion of the knight's way, although this means that the study of his own magic will become very troublesome, some of the magic that relies on the casting material or caused by the movement of the larger, must pause the practice, but also means that the cult, Aaron gang The action will calm down for a long time, your own security will be guaranteed, and the suspected may be getting lower and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another week, Lucien rests in the morning, at home Organizing the experience of recent study, although only practicing the magic of "out of control", "hand of the wizard", "saving the organ" and other materials, but for other apprentice-level magic, the analysis and construction of several magic arrays have always been It is going on, and the trauma of the soul is completely restored a few days ago. The spiritual power and soul are again significantly stronger with the help of meditation. At least, Lucien is now able to continuously cast six informal elements of magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Soul Library, the knowledge that I have learned before, as long as I can find related books, Lucien is also reviewing it in depth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The variegated water brain tissue is preserved under the influence of the "storing organ" magic, as long as the spell is applied once a day, at least three can be saved. In the year, Lucien had enough time to find other materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By benefiting from the reading of religious books and travel notes, Lucien probably knows the countries under the glory of the "God of Truth" as far as the heretics of the North The pagan countries, the dark creatures of the dark mountains, and so on, are still in vain. Of course, the vast majority of Aalto people are the same as Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Lucien’s study is very busy, there is no time to think about extra things, at most occasionally with Uncle Joel, Eliza, Piero, Elena and others talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, your hard work in learning makes me very Satisfied. Since the preliminary knowledge of musical symbols, scales, etc., you have already remembered, then the next step is to combine the knowledge and performance to master and master them, and gradually extend to deeper knowledge of music."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
