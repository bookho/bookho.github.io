			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the "Night Shuttle" scroll, Lucien wants to keep smiling, but finds how he can’t laugh: "Teacher, the situation is not bad." To the extent that even if Thrad is betrayed, the pope will appear, and the gods will be killed. At most, they can directly kill a legendary peak. They must also guard against the northern church and the dark parliament. It is not bad to be able to draw seventeen or eight legends. The members of the parliament will not be less than them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the situation turns sharply, you have to put the five priests of the Holy Spirit, such as Sald, the Kingdom of Holm. The seven epic knights of the Kingdom of Camelot, the Kingdom of Burrian, the Principality of Calais, and the Coastal Corridor of the North are counted together. That is nearly 30 legends, plus the pope in the field of gods, confronting each other. It’s hard to estimate how many legendary magicians can escape.” Fernando would rather prepare for the worst of the situation at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he looked at Lucien with a bright red eye and smiled: "Don’t think of the Pope too weak, no gods, he is also One of the gods, except Douglas, Dracula, Brooke, who has been fighting for many years in the legendary peak, can fight him for a while, and other legendary powerhouses may not be able to take his blow."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, either the wretched or serious and violent Fernando sighed in a rare way: "And the power of God's descending is too horrible, the strongman who locked the legendary peak is the spike. Whether you are a person or a few together, Douglas wants to make the 'eternal blaze' reach an approximate level, at least to promote the gods, so the parliament only ventures to cooperate with Thrall before the restoration of the Pope. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise, ten years later, who is going to consume God? I think that no matter whether it is me, Hathaway, Douglas, Brooke, I have not sacrificed myself." To fulfill everyone’s noble character, and if they join hands, then It is dead together. In addition, the most important thing is that for the seven epic knights, the pope with no gods has a strong influence on their final decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Once they have completely fallen to us, it is the turn of the Pope to weigh the pros and cons. After all, the greatest power that the Southern Church can extract is only equal to us. It no longer has the advantage of overwhelming the surname. After that, the remaining Holy Spirit priests and holy knights have lost more than half of the tragic endings, which will be of great benefit to the Dark Council and the Northern Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien I nodded and understood the strategy of the parliament. That is to use this plan to create a favorable situation and let the seven epic knights turn over. At that time, even if the real general trend has been achieved, the pope will face even if he resumes the gods. For a full-scale war, it is very likely that both sides will suffer and be profited by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha, we have planned some things, plus the stimulation of Thrad, there should be no small grasp for the nobility to completely fall to us, and The overall aristocratic tendency will definitely affect the decision of the epic knight, the teacher, not as good as us..." Lucian made a small suggestion, and also prepared the advice early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face is dignified slightly: “No matter what the effect, you can increase the weight. Five of the seven epic knights are secretly drawn by us. One point, before the situation is favorable, even if they choose to wait and see, they should not refuse to listen, I will communicate with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two push It has made a lot of actions, arrangements, and corresponding countermeasures that Sarder will have under different purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Sarde’s purpose is really like this, I will inform you as soon as possible, oh, I hope that your response will work well, and you Near Nexus Palace, try to help Natasha master the control of the whole city's defensive array in the Nexus Palace. This is a crucial step to prevent change. Morris and other members of the Holm royal family will Work with you." The storm master commanded, and arranged for Lucien to go there, not only to facilitate his escape, but also his special relationship with Natasha, which allowed Natasha to cooperate with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall demon defensive array of Rentart City is not as good as the Glorious Cathedral and Nexel Palace, but it is also stronger than Aalto. Gaining a small advantage, and its control is divided into two parts of relative reading, one in the Glorious Cathedral, one in Necker Palace, the former only waits for Sald to withdraw from the church, the parliament can take over control, after Those rely on Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not say much, solemnly nodded, and then asked curiously: "Teacher, why don't we find other forces to work together." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of plan must be strictly confidential. If you are looking for cooperation between the Northern Church and the Dark Council, it is very likely that you will miss the news in advance, be aware of the church, and they will have There are not many choices, either waiting for us to lose both sides after winning, or taking the opportunity to attack the empty interior of the church. It is impossible to join the battlefield. We must seize this time difference and use the general trend to force the church not to go all out." Fernando Slightly explained, "As for other allies, if you are willing to come, you will definitely come after the change. If you don't want to come, you will not come to seek cooperation in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14th month of the fire, noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirty-fifth floor of the Allinge Magic Tower continues to sound:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Confirm that Pope Benedict II has not left in the holy city of Llanes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirm Saint Melmos, Anasta, Ma Leah and others were near the pope and had not left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirming that the monk leader Saint Odin was in a new space, never left."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Confirm that the monk leader Valen Hill entered the holy city of Lans Confession and prayed, never left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Confirm that the judge Bahá'u'lláh has not left at the headquarters of the Tribunal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Confirm that the light of God is in the fortress of the north, and has not left." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of confirmed information came to the highest scrutiny and the Lucy En and other magicians grasp the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unable to confirm the referee giant, the night watcher St. Anthony, the referee Brentes, the watchman's first place in the 'source of the flame'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unable to confirm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of information is not only about the Southern Church, but also The northern church and the strong mountains of the dark mountains, the Magic Council has been put into use for many years at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated information, after confirming the situation, Douglas got up from his seat and walked to the forefront of the highest panel meeting room, solemnly and solemnly proclaiming:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning the action, everyone is careful about their safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery is on!" Lucien and others right hand Helping the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital of the Principality of Calais. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "distortion master" of the short-haired linen, Elika came out from the black magic tower like astrology, with a strong sense of history, she It is a rare ancient inheritance magician in the highest jury, and sometimes he is also a historian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calculated the time and walked slowly to the Cox Cathedral with several Masters and high-level magicians. At this time, there were two The dragon scales flew past and deliberately shouted: "His Yousnar asked for an emergency aristocratic meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yousnar is the Principality of Calais The epic knight "The Song of Dusk". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erica understands that this is part of the plan, and Yousnar will not make more moves until the situation changes completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the slow-looking Elika and others actually went outside the Cox Cathedral on the other side of the city, one wearing white soft The middle-aged clergyman in the cap looked at her in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turence, are you ready to hand over?" Elika asked the cardinal "Wisdom Angel" Terence of the Calais parish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terence smiled and replied: "The Cardinal has been sent out to inspect the counties. There are only a few bishops and pastors, and the gods are closed. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erica did not rush into, but used his eyes to indicate a summoning mages next to him, and he summoned two high-level devils into it. Control the core of the divine array and the transmission array separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After no problem, several Archmage and magicians entered and controlled different areas, while Elika confronted Terence in the square. Waiting for the progress of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
