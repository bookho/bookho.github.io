			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, Rhine shook his head in a smile: "When Maskillin wrote here, it should be remembered what is vital. So that the mood is turbulent, destroying the secret room, failing to finish the speculative results and rushing away, let us those who take notes are extremely depressed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so, there is no legendary war here, and there is no deliberate damage. It is not difficult to judge that Mr. Muskilllin’s departure is voluntarily voluntary, but he is in a hurry." Lucien regained his calmness and recovered from the clues. The scene at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein looked around and said: "This shows that Maskilin is eager to accomplish something more important than leaving a clue, perhaps the key to destroying monsters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can be rushed, not too late to finish the result... How long does it take for a name? In the case of magic assistance?" Lucien asks himself Self-answer, "less than a second."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein like a historian to identify the long trace of ink that Maskillin finally dragged out I just took a magnifying glass and came out to look at it: "From this scratch, you can clearly feel the shock of Maskillin. According to the truth, he has speculated that this is not the case when he writes his name. I can't write it, unless something happens outside the closet, or if there is any clue that suddenly appears in front of his eyes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart, even I can’t believe it myself: “Maybe when Mr. Muskilllin wrote this, he suddenly remembered The missing key details completely subverted the previous speculation and had a new direction of guessing, so I hurried away and went to other places to seek confirmation of the items or traces. The scratches left by him were so shocking. Because the new guess is that he didn't expect it, and didn't finish the speculative monster identity before, because it was wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very bold The assumption is very reasonable." Rhein admired, "No matter what, I suspect that the monster is related to Tanos, because this guy is a monster himself, huh, like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite familiar with Tanos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also suspected that when I was in the underground palace of the Sun King, I got the torn notes of Tanos and saw the glory of his surname, the ball of light. Or it is a negative emotional light ball, coupled with the performance and rhetoric of Rudolph II, who has been harvested from it, I guess Sun King has found a way to devote himself to the seven ancient devils, and to condense the surname of God from the false gods. Starting, eliminating the negative effects of such **, and such products, in addition to being able to project into others, should also be able to change directly into anyone based on memory or negative emotions."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said that the more smooth, as if Tanos is the murderer, but the thought of being close to the existence of the gods more than a thousand years ago is the murderer, Lucien is shuddering, now " He is afraid that there is a real kind of god power, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein asked in confusion: "He knows the ancient devil. I know some of the information I provided to him. What is the name of the light ball? Negative What is the emotional ball?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the inner hall you didn't find out of Mr. Rhein..." Lucien explained slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein snorted: "He has concealed a lot of research results. From the situation of Rudolf II's several projections, he may have found more A further approach, using ** for the seven ancient devils to get rid of the original restrictions, hey, think about it, do you think that the monster knows that our memory is in line with the characteristics of 'Tanos demon'? Understand all current conditions, I can completely grasp the past and the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In theory, I don’t think I can have something like 'Tanos demon', it’s just An abstract concept used to express a certain truth. If it exists, the required computing power and corresponding energy will be terrible and unimaginable. Even if the whole world is destroyed, all the different space can not be destroyed. Sean started from the rigorous arcane attitude and answered the question of Rhein. At the same time, he silently groaned. If it was "Tanos", I would put "Schrodinger's cat"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein snorted: "Perhaps just a simplified version, well, what do we do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Mr. Muskilllin’s notes were broken in key places, so that we could not know how the monsters were produced, what weaknesses were there, how to use them, and all this, in the Taros they mentioned Legacy labs should have corresponding information, at least the experimental records of how to make monsters must be, if not destroyed by monsters..." Lucien thought about it, overcame the frustration and renewed his fighting spirit, "Mas These ancient magicians of Mr. Killin may not be able to see the problem from the experimental records, but our contemporary arcian may not be aware of the problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien took out the "mirror of fate": "This is what has happened in the past. It should be able to predict accurately, at least more clearly than the weakness of the prophecy monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Maskillin only got the ambiguous hints to let Lucian dispel the idea of ​​predicting monsters with the "mirror of fate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds the magic crystal ball in his left hand, and when it lights up, his right hand is smeared on the "mirror of fate" covered with mysterious patterns. An eccentric curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray mirror of the "mirror of destiny" surface swayed with a layer of water, and a pair of numbers emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coordinates of the Tanos Lab have it." Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the crisp sound of the cockroach, the "mirror of destiny" was completely cracked, but no fragments landed, and it became a piece of light and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go now?" asked Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "The flow rate here is the same as the outside world, much faster than the world of the door. You must take this opportunity to restore the legendary items." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, while picking up the puppet torso, inserting both arms and one leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also took the opportunity to rule out weakness." Rhein nodded and leaned back on a bookshelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, in the secret room, Lucien’s golden crown in his right hand exudes a hint of blackness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crown of the ancient mummies? What effect?" Rhein opened his eyes and the silver eyes returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien licked his lips: "The ancient mummies did not leave a message for the item. Now it can only be judged roughly. It can be changed into gloves, armor, boots. Items such as ** provide the defensive ability close to the legendary peak, immunize a large number of negative legendary magic, and emit horrible decay, but when worn, the brain will be slightly confused, effectively reducing the ability to think..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving information in magical items is a habit that arises in the era of the magical empire, making it easier for each taker to grasp the items. For example, Lucien used "identification" to get it smoothly. The mirror of destiny, at the same time, it also makes the name of the refiner widely circulated and becomes a beautiful talk. Later, this custom was inherited by the church intact, and the collected lost civilization items were treated the same, while the ancient mummies and the Lich King were undead, and apparently no such habits were developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sword of the truth is very good. Anyway, when the knight is fighting, normal thinking is enough. In fact, the standard barbarian epic warrior is also very strong." Rhein joked, "Wait for the shield of truth to be repaired and then set off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, since there is a super defense, there is no need to Waiting for the shield of truth, time is tight." Lu Xien made a decision, and the moon chronograph, the robe of the Arcan sorcerer will be close to half a day to return to a good state, can no longer sit and wait for the monster to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he turned into an epic knight, he turned the "mummy crown" into a "mummy glove". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine leaning against the ground stood still: "Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The serious injury he caused by the monster has not been restored, but it has eliminated the weakness caused by the eternal blaze. It is estimated that it can only play the level close to the legendary third-order level, and it is impossible to use the summoning silver moonfall ability with a buffer time of up to ten hours. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the secret lab of Muskilllin, Lucien and Rhein quickly passed through the grey hall and black gates, to the occasional world of ecstasy Ignore it completely, ignore it with the fastest speed, and don't alarm the monster inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hall in the past, when pushing a black door, Lussien’s fate of the main star projection suddenly jumped, and the great danger rose, so He did not hesitate to raise the "mummy gloves." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the gate, at the same time, sounded a solemn and solemn voice: "Light of judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;They didn't have any scruples, and they found the black door with signs of opening and launched an attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vast expanse of light descended from inexplicable heights, ruling all "sin"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time Lucien met the "light of judgment", the last time was the incarnation of the Lord of Hell, "Gonno", only close to the legendary peak And now, it is the Pope of the Northern Church, and the legendary peak is also ranked first in the existence of the show! The gap between the two powers is separated by a lot of roads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the mighty sacredness, Lucien’s silver-gray metal gloves filled the black gas and melted quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light shines on the glove, like a fireworks bloom, beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sound, there were many cracks in the glove, and the opposite "Angel of Light" followed the use of the magic:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Purifying Spear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The icy light of the spear of the light toward the road to the "light of judgment" Sean cast, at this time, ten **** fingers appeared in front of Lucien, directly grab the spear of light and extinguish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland rescued Lucien in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time that the "light of judgment" disappeared, Lucien felt that his hands were light and that the "mummy gloves" were seriously damaged, and that they could not be used for a short time. After all, the "light of judgment" is very restraining the things of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't delay, you must find a chance to escape, or you will die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Countless thoughts flashed through my mind, but it did not affect his judgment. The right hand had a silver-gray pocket watch, and the ticking of the tick was clearly echoed in the gray hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurzie, Lucien’s middle finger pressed, Ivan’s side suddenly had a hemispherical black void, and his subsequent magical attack was slowed down. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Lucien showed "precise transmission", a space door opening and closing, he appeared directly in front of another black gate The Rhine is close behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien pushed the black door open, the wings of the glory of the gods behind Ivan broke away from the shackles of gravitation and collapse, and fanned out the "light" Ya" shot to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is the door that has not been opened, behind it is a burning horror, Lucien bites his teeth, does not evade, directly hit the black door and rushed in <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep, "Elemental Skin" is broken, "Spell Absorber" quickly reaches the limit, "False Sequence", "Spell Sequencer" brings magic collapse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Lucien relied on the "short-range teleportation" of "spell triggering" to get rid of the remnant power of "light vector", not to distinguish it with Rhein. Open the black door in the direction to escape, continually flee, frantically escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chasing!" "Ivan" did not kill a legendary first-level magician under the raid, and there was some anger in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mad escape, Lucien opened up another black door, and gradually got rid of "Ivan" and "by the rapid change of the gray hall." Angel of Light." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This door seems a little weird, with a hint of white pattern in the black." After a little calm down, Rhine found a rather strange black door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calculated the coordinates and found that it was not a laboratory location, so he guessed: "Perhaps there is a special world behind. We will escape a few gray halls. The distance is not far enough, 'Ivan' is likely to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a lifeline, and the people who are so calm in Lucien can’t help but fear . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein smiled and pushed the weird black door: "Just enter the world behind it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
