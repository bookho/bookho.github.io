Turning to one of the pages, thinking about it, while lifting the feather pen, draws seven lines under the word "consciousness", pointing to the emotions represented by the seven ancient devils such as "greed", "arrogance" and "pain". vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he put a big question mark behind these seven words, and then wrote: "The quantum state transition of the soul requires more possible superpositions? The superposition of the power of many emotions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the pure belief aggregation will be offset by its own consciousness, so that it will not collapse and maintain the quantum superposition state? But this way Will it also affect one's own consciousness, and there is a great hidden danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to solve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Writing here, Lucien’s mouth showed a smile, his fingers tapping on it, seemingly trying to figure out what was being guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shakes his head like a smile, and Lu Xien puts the paper off and retakes the new paper and writes:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Single-Electronic Relativistic Surname Wave Equation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired Natasha is recovering from sleep Suddenly, I felt the power of horror to destroy and destroy, and suddenly opened my eyes with vigilance. I found that the magnetic field around Lusien wearing a nightgown was distorted, the spectrum of dreams was like a picture, and the mighty power came from infinity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearby colors are half black and half white. After colliding together, they are destroyed in an unimaginable state, and then born again from the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real World Feedback..." Natasha looked at the dark and half-white changing scene and understood what it was all about, and it seemed to have It is realized that this is the cycle of material creation and destruction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience accumulated in the impact of the epic knights in the past two years, the problems of the blood of the purely ruined sword of truth, at this moment, like answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled her pajamas down and walked quietly to Lucien, watching what he wrote:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I used to want to avoid the negative energy results derived by Dieppe, Larry, and Ulysian, but constructed this equation, the theory explained all the current experimental results, I It is inevitable to find the derivation of negative energy. If this is the case, even if it is unreasonable, it can only be incorporated into our arcane theory and construct a new system that can contain it. I predict that there is a counter-electron with positive charge. When it meets with electrons, it will immediately disappear and disappear, generating huge energy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promotion, there may be other anti-particles, and these anti-particles constitute The substance can be called antimatter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While writing here, Lucien’s mind also associates some of his verified quantum field theory. The concept, so the vacuum rises and falls, the positive and negative electrons are born from it, and they annihilate each other and release Energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, the background of the universe has become awkward, as if the material is constantly being produced and destroyed, and the vast starry sky is once again reduced from inexplicable distance. Great real-world feedback, letting electronics and vacuum change, and building a new legendary magic that is not complete! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Lucien’s cognition of the “eternal blaze” in the world is naturally engraved in his soul, directly into the legendary third-order, Even if there are only ten legendary magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yang electronic gun?" Lu Xien ended the paper, closed his eyes and felt the broken new legendary magic, understand that to make it complete Must be truly looking for "anti-electronics." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand the mysteries of the world, simply relying on tempering blood, and feeling the power of the blood, it is really difficult to improve..." Natasha sighed aside, this That is why the epic knight goes to the upper level, the number is lower than the magician's sake, but her surname is cheerful, and soon she is revived, full of morality, "good, although I don't understand the specific arcane theory, but I have explained and demonstrated to you, I think I will be promoted to epic soon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth of the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the public class of Lucien, the Magic Council has fallen into the whole A strange "quiet" state, everyone is discussing the electronic double-slit interference experiment, discussing Oliver's cat, Douglas's entangled particles, Lucien's delayed selection experiment, etc., but no one has parliamentary awareness, thinking, and wisdom. The observer's influence on the microcosm, subconsciously escaping this horror to the extreme interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they don’t think about it, it doesn’t mean that the great Arcanists and the great arcans in the microscopic field don’t think about it. The papers on this subject have been submitted to the Arcane. Audit Committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry sat in the dark study, as if he had been sitting here for thousands of years without moving, Oliver’s cat made him fear, Lucian’s observer The theory makes him afraid, and it is difficult to calm down his own research and adventure, and this is all the problem in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he sighed and picked up a stack of papers in front of him for review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "What is consciousness?"...His Vicente..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Limits of Spirit and Meat"...Lord of the Speaker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Difference Between Soul and Consciousness - The Problem of the Observer Effect... Lord Fernando... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""What is observation?"...Heather Heather..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Larry read these papers and only felt that his mind was bloated. After Evans introduced consciousness into the microscopic field, the objective and objective elements of the field were full of colorful fantasy, and all kinds of incredible conjectures seemed to destroy their own three views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed the forehead to put aside the papers on consciousness, soul, and observation, and decided not to think about them for a while. Suddenly, he saw a copy. A relatively thick paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Single-Electronic Relativistic Surname Wave Equation, Lucien Evans..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper has been written before, so I looked up and read it with all my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading, his expression became very excited, his left hand constantly pulling his bow tie, seems to want to diverge the heart of the burning: "I actually guessed one directly The equation form, and then explain it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this equation is full of the beauty of mathematics and arcane, succinct and beautiful as if it contains the most profound and essential The laws and mysteries!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his eyes are wide, because all the problems that have occurred in the microscopic field in the past few years have been used by Lucien The equation is strictly explained. The Brooke scattering experiment, the anomalous magnetic field experiment, and the spectral fine structure are perfectly governed by this equation. Even the electron spin model hypothesis proposed by Annick and Sprint is also used by Lucy. The equation is strictly derived, indicating that it is a relativistic effect of electrons following the law of conservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading such a paper seems to have one after another, and Larry’s eyes are stunned. He said to himself: “This is a long time in the past. The perfect summarization and refinement of the development of time micro-field, the brilliant golden era is concentrated into a paper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Previously we studied the micro-field, just like Ordinary people pick apples, it is very difficult to get one, and Evans's equation and this paper show the scene that Apple has matured and rained down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After shocking and sighing, he reviewed the following content and saw Lu Xien’s speculation on anti-particle and anti-matter. He was silent for a while: “... Why didn’t I dare to predict this boldly?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also knows that his previous equations have many problems, not just negative energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really a positron?" Larry said to himself, writing a review:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
