			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Atomic Universe" projection is vast and profound, with constant elemental fission, constant fusion reaction, destruction and creation superimposed state, even in the face of "Thunder Hell" The impact, no distortion and disintegration, together with it in the small study room to create a strange scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stunned: "You are approaching the legendary third-order... Real-world feedback on the probabilistic interpretation of wave functions?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his mind, there is still a remnant of Lucien’s confrontation with himself, saying that determinism must die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Lucien nodded lightly and took out two papers. "They interpret everything with the probability of a wave function, which constitutes quantum mechanics." , that is, the three basic principles of the microscopic field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Inspiring Names of Uncertain Principles" "Complementary Principles of Waves and Particles"..." Fernando When I read the word "uncertain", there was a blue vein on the forehead, which reminded him of the "probability" and the probability that he must be sent to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...A set of incorrect amounts is an amount that cannot be determined at the same time. Knowing one of them accurately will inevitably lead to uncertainty in another, such as when After fully understanding the speed and quality of an electron, you will find that it has disappeared and has no position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first paper is a matrix familiar to Fernando. Mechanics, the familiar momentum multiplication position is not equal to the position multiplication amount, but this time, in addition to the mathematical expression, Lucien gives the specific arcane meaning, responding to the arcane divisions who have been criticized for the real meaning of matrix mechanics. We. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fernando would rather not have this arcane meaning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this again denies the effort to explore the world, in the end, no matter how hard we try, it is difficult to accurately know the specific information of the electronic? The precise mastery of a surname will inevitably lead to the uncertainty of another surname? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undetermined, probabilistic microscopic particles are the cornerstone of the material of the whole world, so the material is also uncertain and probabilistic? And the composition of us is equally uncertain and probabilistic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply the most ridiculous and funny theory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Fernando suppressed the low ground: "This is caused by observation? Because the microscopic particles are too small, too easy to be disturbed, so all our observations It will cause it to change, so it is impossible to determine the amount of one of the arcane changes while grasping another amount of this change?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the interpretation He is also relatively easy to accept, which means that two measurements can be done in a roundabout way. This is still observable, researchable, and can sum up the world of essential laws, not the one in Lucien’s mouth. Space, the world of ubiquitous probabilities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment and sighed: "This is strictly derived from the premise of mathematical assumptions, that is, no other impurities Inside, so I would like to elaborate that the principle of uncertainty is that the essence of microscopic particles is the surname, the surname of the guilty, has nothing to do with the means of observation. As for why it shows this surname, it needs to be studied, just like why it It has the same name as the wave granules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face has long been red, the forehead is blue, the drums are more powerful, and a book is blown. The torrential rain fell in the thunder of lightning and the black and white atmosphere completely blocked the bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He managed to control himself and looked at Lucien’s last paper. This paper made him feel better because it was Lucien. The theory that has been expressed long ago, blind people touch the dragon! In the absence of a true understanding of microscopic particles, it can only be described in terms of rigorous experimental results, even if these results contradict each other, because this is the contradiction of the state we are currently in, and they are unified at a higher level. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use this concept to describe the uncertainty principle as caused by the wave-particle two-image surname, when the particle name is more significant, the wave name It disappears naturally, and vice versa, so it presents a similar relationship between momentum, position, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three papers construct a logically self-consistent theoretical explanation, which shows the profound laws of matrix mechanics and microscopic fields. But this law is that Fernando definitely does not want to need! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a few times more than just a few thunderous sounds, Fernando eyes fixed on the road to Xi'an, the arc jumped in the pupil, the left eye is a terrible scene of chaos, a lightning bolt in the study, destroyed Dropped a shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the initial state cannot strictly determine the subsequent development of things, if the microscopic particle field is full of uncertain relationships, then our world should be like this, than The endless abyss still has chaos, but also disorder, there is no possibility of our survival and thinking!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is blowing in the face, the rain falls like a note, can be like this The power is hard to compare with the vast universe, and it seems very small after entering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to be standing in the center of this innocent atomic universe, low in the earth: "The generalized determinism has long encountered difficulties in the N-body problem, and micro The field is a place where the original concept needs to be abandoned. The uncertainty in the microscopic field does not represent the uncertainty of the macro world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N body problem is the concept of celestial mechanics The more simplified is the three-body problem, that is, the celestial body running system composed of three planets, because they interact with each other, it is very complicated, so the actual trajectory can not be solved strictly, and only the method of determining the surname can be used to discuss the global or local The solution of these moments has a great contradiction with determinism, but the star system generally believes that this is the reason why the current mathematical theory is still not developed enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is there such a big difference between the microscopic field and the macroscopic field?" Fernando’s roar is more terrifying than thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless elements around Lucien: "This is what we want to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing understands, everything needs to be studied again, would you dare to propose such a theory?" Fernando's more angry, has caused changes in the surrounding sky, the rising sun is covered by dark clouds, and lightning flashes through the sky. It also made Helen, who was on the Ariel's Magic Tower, discover and informed the big arcans such as Douglas that she was worried that she could not control the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a step forward in the vast universe of projections: "This is derived from the current large number of experimental results, which is the most consistent with the current microscopic field. Theory and phenomena!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mistake of it should not be refuted by the theory, but by a definite experiment!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Lucien pushed his monocle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, calm down first, design Experiment to ** it, refute me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando understands that this is just an interpretation by Lucien - only the uncertainty principle is strictly derived, but it In the end, what is the meaning of the Arcane remains to be discussed, so after taking a deep breath, he reluctantly suppresses his emotions, and then the voice is loud and clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also impossible to accept your theory. I can't agree that our world is built on a scorpion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thunder and lightning disappeared, the rain stopped, and the screams still whispered, as if to show Fernando’s mental state, and this scene made Lucine feel more depressed than the previous scene: “On this road, I have always supported myself to protect myself. Did the teacher stand on the other side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Helen came in and said with a little doubt: "What happened?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, Oliver, Vicente and other six arcane masters have arrived in almost a few tens of seconds, if Fernando and Lucien outbreak or Exploding his head, the entire Aringe will be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and pointed at the paper on the table: "Look at your own rubbing, remember, this is just a nightmare of Lucien, can't be taken seriously. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the papers on the table, even Douglas, I was subconsciously afraid, I heard Fernando’s explanation, and saw him standing here, they They have each printed a copy and roughly browsed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the light in the study was dark again, the universe was smashing and destroying the universe, and Oliver whispered: "The ridiculous, completely nonsense." Whispering! This is fundamentally different from our real world, only in dreams!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
