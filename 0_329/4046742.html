			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the pale blue ray, Mason and Frederick flew out of the hotel and rushed to the edge of the town where the Elf guards were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the ground spurted a dark red flame and plunged into the air, as ferocious as a volcanic eruption, just in front of Mason and Fred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Matvey, what do you want to do?" Mason stopped his flight in time, did not hit the flames and smoke, his eyes filled with anger The tall and thin man who blocks himself - "The Wrath of the Earth" Matvey, the seven-day Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matvey keeps a short inch, the dark green hair is like the sea of ​​seaweed, he looks up at Mason and Fred, not panic Not busy: "Have you forgotten the flight in the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prohibition is not achieved by magical arrays, but depends on several powerful days. The "small town defender" composed by the knight - after the initial chaos and bloody development of the unnamed town, under the eagerness of calling for order and the dark support of the elves, several knights who have been here for a long time have begun to form. The alliance, to establish order for the town, to restrain the killing between each other, to maintain the peace of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mattvi is one of the "town maintainers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, what is the meaning of prohibiting flying?" The same as the Knights of the day, Fred and Mason are not afraid of Matvey, but they are worried about attracting The attack of the elf, "We just want to accept the investigation of the elf? Do you want to stop this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the earth" Matvey, Mason and Fred is faintly alert, because the strangeness they feel comes from him and his companions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matvey and others did not do anything bizarre, just after the devil’s first attack, often surnamed desperate, painful and anxious Emotions, that the legend of Elf Wang Ting and Druid Presbyterian Church can't hold the gap in the abyss, because with the gradual expansion of the gap, perhaps the "Abyss Will" will come directly, so staying in the town of the unknown is just waiting for death. There is absolutely no possibility of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of impetuous anxiety, this desperate frustration, this tyrannical pain, under their influence, spreads quickly into the crowd, because such emotions belong to Normal reaction, Mason and Ferred did not doubt anything, but instinctively did not want to contact Mattwe and others, as if the more people contacted, the whole person is lower, the more painful, the more struggling, the more unable to control their emotions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We also accept the joint inquiry of the elves and the magicians, but we are not in a hurry, and do not violate the rules of the town." Matvimo's green eyes are not. There is nothing wrong with it, "Mason, Ferred, you should be very clear. The more you are worried about the impetuous, the more you need order. Only by establishing a firm and strict order can you ensure that the situation will not become chaotic and guarantee ourselves. The safety, therefore, I will not give you privileges because you are a Knight, please go to the 'maintainer's cabin' to accept the punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason had to Admitted that Matvey said it makes sense, but the feeling of suppressing eccentricity is always on his mind, so that he did not move one step, and Fred is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattvi raised his right hand: "Mason, Fred, do you want to resist? Rebel against the seven-day knight, against the high elves and the legendary strong?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurers on the street all slowed down and became cautious, seemingly aware of the danger of being on the verge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east of the "natural residence" is a dense forest that appears dark green . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Martha lives in it. She is one of the representatives of the natural abomination. Don't anger her. If she has anything to offend, I First apologize on her behalf." Elstin, a green leaf skirt, said to the next Ulysian, Felipe, Heidi and Annick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are still several directions to be investigated, the magicians are still splitting their actions, but Heidi thinks that Sprint’s transformation of Annick has little effect yesterday. So I re-divided the team arrangement, decided to shoot myself, and planned to meet some of the elf friends with Annicko. She and Katrina and Elano Daniel have become good friends, and the relationship with many elves has become good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses smiled politely: "It doesn't matter, every life has its own philosophy, as long as it does not harm us, it is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Even the princess of the Elf family apologized in advance, what else can he say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe hands in his black long trench coat pocket, slightly decapitated, his eyes crossed the trees, looking far away, not knowing what to think, It seems that yesterday's exchanges with the elves and the investigation of the natural residence made him gain a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two members in front of him, Heidi is inevitably distracted, using the mind to connect to Annick: "When the investigation is completed, Ms. Martha, I bring Go to the Elf's 'natural dance'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dance, dance...I, I won't dance." Annick was shocked and talked It’s a bit stuttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi gave him a glance: "Whoever is born will dance? Hey, the elf seems to be...not letting you date with the elves, know more Friends, seeing more things helps you to be cheerful. I don't want my good friends to suffer serious mental illness because of studying arcane and magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She is also very familiar with Rachel, who is next door, and knows a lot about psychological problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick wants to say "I am very happy and happy to study arcane and magic. Every time I solve a problem, I can get a lot of satisfaction than dancing and knowing friends." "But he is also a person who attaches great importance to his friends. See Heidi, Lei Yiya, Sprint, Katrina has been worried about his introverted shyness, and there has been a little change of thought - anyway, after going back, still Arcane and magic are the mainstays, and Heidi is the same for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin is like a deer in the forest, agile and agile in the forest, soon, under her leadership, Yuris Ann, Heidi and others saw a dark green undecorated tree house, and more than a dozen elves were accepting the dance instructions on the open space below the tree house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha is a famous musician and dancer of the elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen elves standing in front of a hair-raising night elf. Her dark blue skin has a strange beauty, temperament and looks. For maturity, such as the same fruit that has reached the sweetest season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The body bends back a little further... What is this pain? Is there a forest that is being painfully cut by human beings? Is green a desert pain?" Martha The teaching was very strict and fully demonstrated the true nature of her natural hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This dance is called the dance of revenge. Every movement has a unique meaning, expressing the anger of nature. You must deeply understand this feeling. You can dance this dance well. For example, this action, you have to think of the extinct animals, they have completely disappeared into the world, and the reason is only human greed, their fur, flesh and bone pairs. Humans are useful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of selfishness, humans are unscrupulously hurting nature. One day, naturally, it will erupt its anger and cleanse all evil... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the words taught by Martha, Ulysian frowned slightly and thought: "This kind of speech, such a dance, and a special summoning ceremony are really It’s very similar, as long as they finally believe that they really have 'natural revenge' to achieve the desired effect... But why are the natural balances of the elves falling more? Why does Martha know that the parliament has sent people to assist in the investigation? Continue to teach the dance of revenge? She thinks this method is very hidden, we can't find it, or is it really not her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayerstin Trail: "Ms. Martha, bothering you, there are a few guests who want to ask you some questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha has long noticed Felipe and others The closeness, deliberately did not ask, until Ellerdett opened, she only ugly and politely said: "His Royal Highness, I don't want the dirty human beings to set foot on my place, I don't know what problems I have. Answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., we just want to know where you learned the revenge dance?" Yurisian asked without anger, very calmly. Martha snorted: "I was inspired by the destruction of nature by mankind Your own creation. Are you satisfied with this answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
