			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small living room of "The Reality", Douglas saw Franks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He failed to promote the legend, many magical rituals that can last more than five hundred years of life can not be used, the whole person is quite old, the hair is sparse and pale, the skin is full It is folds, and the patches of old people are very eye-catching, but his blue eyes are as deep as the sea, as if carrying the wisdom of countless hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Franks, how come over? Is it going to hold a lich conversion ceremony?" Douglas asked casually as a member of the Panel, just after the war, When he was in a hurry, he really should be too busy to see the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks shook his head and smiled: "Becoming a lich will abandon the many enjoyments and desires as human beings, and may even be radically and mad by negative energy attacks. It's really not a good choice. I still have no idea. I plan to wait a second time and see if there is any chance to recognize the world's semi-cured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your idea Very good, the development of arcane and magic in the last ten years is so fast that I feel terrible. Maybe it will take a long time to have a new theory or new achievement for you, so that you can turn years of accumulation into cognition. The world's semi-cured foundation." Douglas nodded lightly, agreeing with Franks' choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his heart, this stage of crazy development of arcane is based on Felipe's study of cell memory surnames, with Lucien submitting the periodic table as the official start. He seems to have seen the birth of two new legendary magicians, so when Vicente tried to break Felipe out of the demigod lich, he agreed and let the proposal pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks laughed and said: "His Lord, it is very likely that there will be a long time to have new theory or new results for my current bottleneck, but they also More likely to explode my head, especially Lucien Evans, the headshot, the head demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and shook his head, knowing Lucien is "notorious" in the hearts of the magicians: "The progress he has brought has not yet fully demonstrated. Maybe three years, maybe five years, ten years, you can see the new theory he proposed. The value of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks smiled: "Like "On the electrodynamics and mass equations of moving objects"?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiles fade away, slightly stunned: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks continued: "I saw this at the time." At the time of the thesis, there is a feeling that confidence is completely destroyed, as if the cognitive world will collapse at any time, not because of the shock En? Evans's genius, but suspicion of self-recognition, doubts about the arcane system of the past few hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Douglas, I am from After the Twilight War, you will follow you step by step, from the oppression of the church and the sway of the nobles. Your theory of gravity, your system of movement, is the beacon that guides me to turn my thoughts into the spirit of the Arcane. Now, one of the two lighthouses was suddenly declared a mistake and collapsed. I really don't know what the letter is. I feel like the ship in the storm, it is dark and I can't find the direction again."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sounds low: "Not a mistake, but a low-speed approximation of the relativistic system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aura It became very weird and seemed to have unspeakable silence and depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks looks at Douglas sincerely: "His Speaker, the low-speed approximation is actually to show that your sports system ignores too many things and has too much error. It can only be applied in such a macro state, and when is time, space is time, time depends on matter, and it is a function of speed. Don't you feel that it completely subverts our cognition?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really different from intuitive understanding. It is hard to imagine that when I first saw it, there was a feeling that life was completely negated in the past thousand years." Douglas admitted quite honestly to the arcane. On the question, he has always been this attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks is very heavy: "Probably our past research is still superficial, still on the surface of the world, not close to reality, so this appeared Kind of situation, maybe we are far away from the reality of the world. Maybe when we are really close to 'real', we will find that it is completely different from what we think and insist on. It may even be our objection."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks sighed softly: "The real world begins to exceed our imagination. More and more questions we can't answer. More and more things are pointing at the same thing. What is the nature of gravity? It was originally How did it happen? If your celestial movement system is established, what is the initial power to make the planet spin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also my doubt What is the source of gravity, and how it is transmitted. In the beginning, how did it occur, how to make the system of celestial movements established, and sometimes, have to admit that the more you know, the more confused, the more fearful, Maybe, I was wrong from start to finish." Douglas's voice seemed a little ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks blue eyes are getting deeper and deeper, the right hand spread out, and the gesture is used to strengthen the tone: "Maybe we should look for an explanation from the philosophy, maybe There is the first driving force, there is the root of everything, in which case, the gravitational system, the celestial operating system, can be perfectly constructed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the face For old friends, it is also discussing the arcane problem. Douglas did not hide it. The voice was a bit stunned: "Sometimes, I can’t help but think about it. Maybe there is a supreme being, and there is a first impetus. Otherwise, the entire arcane system cannot be explained from the source, just like a villa without a foundation. When the wind blows, it will collapse and destroy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is getting more and more Weird and peaceful, Franks eyes seem to have a flash of light: "In other words, without the first driving force, your gravitational system and movement system will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Douglas added another sentence, " Less is the case, but maybe some other arcane explanations can be found in the future.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks’ voice is low: “What is the origin of the whole world? I am Who? Who is me? Where are we from? Where will we go? Can these questions be explained from the Arcane study?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Temporarily not, still in The category of philosophy." Douglas shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks also shook his head: "No, it is the scope of theology. As long as you admit that there is a supreme being and a first impetus, these problems can be explained. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas opened his mouth, what he wanted to say, suddenly his pupil contracted: "Who are you? You are not Franks!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franks seems to have something in it, and the atmosphere becomes sacred and tranquil: "You can call me Benedict III."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope... What are you doing? Franks?" Douglas was not too alarmed. In his own half-face, in his own magic tower, even the pope, the silver moon, the Lord of Hell, came true. There is also the confidence to fight a battle - the premise is that there is no god drop, so the pope who projected to Franks in a strange way, he is not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic tower energy flow, a mysterious magical array opened, the outside "real secret" directly into the night, dark and starry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict III just smiles at this change: "Franks is willing to let me project, otherwise I will project to an unwilling Archmage. "In the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that he is already a church person. No wonder so many things have been leaked before. I have always suspected that the committee has spies, but I didn't expect him to be Douglas faced this as the highest level of spy, only a moment of inexplicable sadness, and worked hard with himself to establish an old friend of the Magic Council. In his later years, he even went to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, he is also very fortunate that this "Mushroom Cloud" plan only selected a few trust-tested committees to know the general situation, there is no Franks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benius III is very peaceful and authentic: "Franks recognizes the problem of the origin of the Arcane, so return to the Lord's embrace, Douglas, don't deny, your The heart has begun to believe in the first driving force, and believes that there is a supreme being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can’t deny that I believe in the first impetus, I believe in supremacy. Exist." Douglas replied blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III reveals a glimmer of joy: "Well, if you are willing to accept baptism, you will be the first saint of the church, and will be given the holy name by the Lord. Become a pope in the future, explore the secrets of the gods, and truly get eternal life and happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
