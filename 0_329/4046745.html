			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the natural residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha saw Ulysian, Felipe and other magicians returning under the leadership of Ellerstin, so I was cold and sharp: "I don't I know what else I can say. If you suspect that I have a problem, please report to Her Majesty and the elders, and let them decide whether to arrest and interrogate me. But before that, please leave me far away. The stench of your heart makes me sick!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe and Yurisian seem to have not heard such excessive words from Martha, calmly turning their attention to Ellerstin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylestin took two deep breaths, courage, and his face was not very good-looking: "Ms. Martha, the magicians think you have some suspicions, So I hope to be able to search your cabin and the tree bag on your body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? They think I am suspect, so I have to search?" Martha interrupted Ellestin’s words were incredibly sharp and reciprocal. This is exactly the opposite of what she had previously expressed. There was a volcanic eruption in the horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who accepted her teaching were equally difficult to restrain their own surprises. At the same time, the accumulated resentment and disgust made them feel the same, as if they had similar anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellsting quickly added: "Mother has agreed to their request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What?" Martha stepped back, and the elves next to them solidified their expressions. Her Majesty agreed to the unreasonable demands of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying this, Ellerd finally put down the package in his heart and the expression became smooth: "Mrs. Martha, I hope you can understand, the elf The tree is the foundation of our survival. Every elf wants to find the cause of its pollution as soon as possible and let it return to normal. In the process, there will definitely be wrong judgments and directions. This is inevitable. The elf was aggrieved. I first apologize, but I will not stop the investigation. If I can't search it, I can't ask, it's hard to go deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She took the responsibility of the matter completely on the body of the Elf King, and took it on himself. There is no mention of a magician and a human being. Although the tone is gentle, but it is powerful, the superiors are full of demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period of experience has given her the most honed training since birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who learn to dance next all nodded slightly. In any case, the elf tree is the first priority. Although there is resentment and resentment in the hearts of others, this can be prevented. The investigation is tantamount to jokes about the survival of one's life and death, just to pay attention to which elf is not allowed by the damn human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the magicians who looked to Heidi, Annick, and Aphrodite became more resentful and hateful, and seemed to blame them for all their dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue skin on Martha’s face makes it difficult to see her face change. After nearly a minute, when everyone thinks she is searching by default, She suddenly said: "I don't accept such filth, Her Majesty is definitely blinded by these dirty human magicians!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is for my character And the attack of the soul, I swear to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her resolutely opposed attitude makes other elves quite surprised, if I really believe that I am innocent, etc. It is not too late to protest to Her Majesty the Queen, the Grand Elder, and the Princess, even when there is nothing to search. Now it is so fierce to express that it is doubtful that she does have problems. This is not a good time to make emotions and tempers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ms. Martha, if you are worried that the magicians are falsifying evidence to smear you, we can supervise the whole process, I believe that the natural gift of our magic is definitely no worse than magic. A female surnamed elf persuaded her. She thought that Martha refused to search because of such fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other male surnames also comfortably agree: "Even if they falsify evidence, we can easily prove that your character is innocent, because it matters. The pollution of the elf tree is very clear to see if the black spot has been eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi saw Annick and looked at Ulysses again. Nodded and confirmed the opinion, Martha did have problems, but she was too obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe put his hands in his pockets, and his tall and thin figure didn't shake a little. He walked into the tree house on a walk. Step by step, the air in front of him seemed to be a ladder, let him go directly to the tree, and the elves also followed. In the past, I was afraid that he would concoct evidence against Martha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian, Heidi, Annick did not provoke the idea of ​​the elf, and with Ellestin, Martha, flew in the middle of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree house is small, but it is neat and clean, and there is a fragrance of trees and flowers everywhere. In addition to books, music, and albums, Martha’s room is only A simple leaf hammock and some small ornaments withered petals, odd stones, and falling leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick and other magicians assigned to Urisian, cast magic to search every corner of the two tree houses, among which Crystal Dragon Avery Positive, the puppies shuttle between the elves, and look at the surroundings with gaze, as if to keep the items such as the sparkling stones in their minds, and occasionally put their claws up and "check", and for a long time they are not willing to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Felipe found a note from the book and looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a note on music and dance. Can you understand it?" Martha was not in a good mood, and said in a thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe heard the elf word of music, the right hand shook a little, then indifference: "Reassured, my art cells are not as you think Less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Are you taking the keel's thigh bone as a clarinet or a rib for a lyre?" Martha sneered sarcastically. In yesterday's exchanges with some elves, Felipe did not hide his identity as a Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sarcasm of Martha, Felipe turned a deaf ear, continued reading, and after a long time, Yurisian, Annick, Heidi, Aphrodite After the search for other places ended, they shook their heads and said that they had no gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s head was raised, and there was no expression on the face of the sick face: “Mrs. Martha, I just want to ask a little, why are you recording 'revenge’? In the dance, there will be a paragraph next to each movement that promotes natural hatred and human hatred, as if it were a necessary specific step and ritual language?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hearing Felipe's words, Yurisian, Heidi and others all had their eyes bright, and they noticed something, but they quickly frowned slightly. It seemed to be too easy and too easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha’s expression is poorly explained: “This is to explain the essentials of each movement, and what does this have to do with the ceremony?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is the essentials, at the level of your dancers, you only need to write down the corresponding emotions, there is no need to make a speech and an oath." Felipe was not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to the elf just wants to defend Martha, Felipe suddenly took out a book: "This is a special ceremony to summon the devil, you can see one Look and see if it is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellesting looked over and saw the above obvious words: "Vicken's special summoning ceremony" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, it’s really ready." Martha looked out of the house and sneered at the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other elves have taken this book in confusion and began to circulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they read a few pages, Martha suddenly took a step back and went to the edge of the tree house, then thrown in the stick, quickly grew up, changed It became a two-meter-high dark green monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, her surrounding black and white cockroaches suddenly appeared, each with a mysterious extraordinary light, the clouds covered the top to Felipe, Yurisian , Ellerstin, Aphrodite, etc. flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heavenly worm", the druid's seven-level magic, consists of a number of magical creatures that cause itching, paralysis, and mental distraction, once magic The division is riddled with these insects, and the spellcasting will be interrupted frequently. Even the spells that have been engraved in the soul will be reduced to a terrible degree. It is a weapon for the Druid to deal with the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other elves were stunned and felt that the attack was sudden, but Ulysian and others were prepared, and Aphrodite muttered "I am not a frog, I Don't eat bugs, while raising your head and screaming, the pressure from the top creatures is released, and the insects in the sky are slightly solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the action of this powerful magnetic field, the magical insects still composed of matter have been sucked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martha flew backwards, and the surrounding trees all came to life. The trees of several meters high waved the branches of pale green light and surrounded the tree house from all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are filthy, I am going to ask Lord Ferragand for help!" she said deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s hands are still in his pockets, and the deep black air is coming, and the waves are flowing all around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark green monster that the cane turns into is just touching the water wave, it loses the luster of the surface, it seems to be a lot of faint, and the tree people who come in All fell to the ground, as if there was no strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-ring range of magic in the Necromancer, the depleted wave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s Ulysian, Heidi, Annick, etc. were not affected because of the black gas initiative, which shows that he is interested in this seven-ring magic. Control has reached an alarming level. For the average high-level magician, the depletion wave is not against me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi connected through the mind: "Get ready to use the ritual, don't let Martha escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't have the financial resources to pay for such a ritual, but Annick was a rich guy, so she helped him make one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a powerful power source in the shadows, and the electric light that is visible to the naked eye is constantly moving around, and the sound of Zizz is scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dragon of the Greens" Mason found that his vision began to blur, knowing that he had reached the limit and could only rely on the will to force support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the soft sunshine of the sun shines on him, let him relax, the electric light disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Mason asked in a hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cordial and awkward voice sounded: "I am Atlante of the Magic Council, rest assured, there is me, no one can hurt you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason really relaxed, and the body was weakly restored to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, in the town of the unknown, Atlante said to Lanhill, Celine, and Lodell: "Can confirm, horse Teve and others and several high elves participated in this matter, trying to use the situation of the unnamed town to summon the real devils with the number of high-ranking powers comparable to the heavenly rituals. Unfortunately, they were all inspired by the devil projection. Under the blast, let us not know who the black hand behind the scenes is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blocking the unnamed town is Ferragad's proposal." Lanhill face Said darkly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selene also nodded slightly: "These elves are naturally hateful, and have a lot to do with Mattaway."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lordel is stunned: "Is it really Ferragad, but what is he for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He is the leader of the natural hate faction. This may be the reason! No, no matter whether he is suspect or not, I have to return to the natural residence immediately, so as not to have problems!” Lan Hill said in a hurry. “Here, please.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante also closed his eyes: "I also return to the natural home, can not let Ulysses fall into danger."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Queen is trying to suppress the pollution of the Elf Tree, and it is no problem to deal with ordinary elves, but in the face of the "natural Avengers" Ferragad, it may not be able to restore one-tenth of the strength. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, we guard the gap, waiting for the return of the elders and Mr. Evans." Rodel agreed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
