			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lance, in the book of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope, here is the secret information from the North." A cardinal is sincerely willing to submit the confidential documents sent through the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the information, Pope Gregory directly disassembled and read it carefully. The Cardinal waited for his instructions and was ready to do so. The command of His Majesty the Pope is passed on to the preparations of the various parishes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mardi Moss secretly controlled the city of the Shahran Empire near the northwest corner of the Dark Mountain Range, preparing for a blood sacrifice." The Pope's expression was slightly shocked. Obviously, I didn't think that "The Lord of Hell" Maldi Moss could do this kind of thing under his own eyes. It seems that the vicissitudes of victory over the years and the chaos on the edge of the dark mountains have blinded the clergy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this time, Adrien’s misunderstanding found that the hidden magician colluded with the devil and was killed, so that more than a dozen parishes in the north were fully engaged in the investigation. Maybe you will not notice until the "Lord of Hell" comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him a little annoyed, picked up the Platinum Scepter, and suddenly got up and said in a dignified manner: "Summon Ivan, Quent to the northwest of the Dark Mountains." Defuli's city, I want to personally purify this polluted land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care to go alone, after all, the opposite is a god, if you hurt a lot Defeating Maldimos, perhaps the sneaky "Silver Moon" will fall from the sky, so he transferred the two saints to Gedford City, a legendary peak, one close to the legendary peak, so basically no any problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, His Majesty the Pope." The Cardinal began drafting the decree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory thought about it. First of all, "At the same time, he praised Felix. This time his investigation was fruitful and he can offset the punishment of Adrien's murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." Red The bishop answered with respect and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the seal was left, Pope Gregory stepped into the transmission array, intending to rob his "Hell Lord" before he completely destroyed him. hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the height of the city of Gedford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory looked grimly at the bottom and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s still a little late." The bright-eyed Ivan touched the nose that he had slightly swelled, and his tone was very dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city below has been completely wrapped in blood, and there is a scream of screams that are extremely painful and contain other charms. And in the blood flowing. A corpse carries a heavy load and is extremely sultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the city, a door that engraves innumerable devils and human heads is slowly disappearing, and the strong smell of sulfur permeates into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory snorted softly: "It’s not too late. At least Mardi Moss has not had time to leave this place."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is most worried that Mardi Moss will not fight with himself after his arrival. Directly far away. Everywhere, the wind and the rain, with the power of the gods and his shackles, the "land of faith" of the god of truth will fall into the turmoil of continuous violence. The magicians, dark creatures, and different gods that have not yet been completely extinct will have a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a class god escapes with a heart, he will run away if he feels wrong. Even if he has "God Drop", things will be very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he did not hesitate to raise his right hand, holding up the Platinum Scepter, solemn and solemn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great God of Truth, you are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacred light bursts from His body, flowing on his body, holy and unparalleled, and makes people dare not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the vastness, sacred and solemn, and the feeling of transcendentality descended from the inexplicable heights, completely covering the entire city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city, the vague shadow of a first-born goat's horn suddenly emerges, exuding the horror of evil and degenerate, shaking the lock of "God Dropping". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind him, nine layers of hell emerge in sequence, bronze castles, burning cities, silent plains, etc. as essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the cities nearby, believers have prayed, and their hearts are inexplicably moved, with an indescribable gentleness and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prayer sounded over the city of Gedford, empty and vast Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, the seven-story heavenly mountain projection gradually emerged. One angel, one by one, prayed with enthusiasm, and the voice of the holy voice was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Gregory narrowed his eyes and solemnly waved the Platinum Scepter in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the seventh floor of the Heavenly Mountain, the boundless light erupted, merged into the ocean of light, and drowned the city of Gedford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of screams came from the city, that huge The evil figure quickly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is over, the whole city has disappeared into the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s face was white, and the right hand holding the Platinum Scepter was slightly trembling, but his voice was still steady: “Rewarding Felix again The value of his intelligence is immeasurable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little later, things are in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Following, His Majesty the Pope." Ivan and Kwant replied together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory nodded: "Okay, return to the Holy City with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Now it seems that "Silver Moon" should not be shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Ivan asked with concern: "His Majesty, next month's 'Supreme Religious Conference' need not be postponed until next year?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, hold on time." Gregory looked at himself and saw that the situation was fine, so he did not want to show weakness. After all, the "rest period" was enough. Did not use "God Drop" twice in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, His Majesty the Pope." Ivan painted a cross on his chest and whispered, "Only the truth will last forever."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oliver redefines the four elements of geothermal feng shui, incorporating gravity into it, that really What is the element? This requires us to give a strict definition. I believe that there are many kinds of elements in this world. For example, gold, silver, sulfur, etc. cannot be the same element. There are not many similarities in the experiment." Heather In the discussion of Arcane, Wei has always been exposed to the side of his language organization, and the silver-gray eyes are fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers: "You have a good idea, I feel a little inspired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice did not fall, Fernando came in with a calm face: "'The Lord of Hell' was swept back to hell by the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "Douglas asked with a slight frown." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
