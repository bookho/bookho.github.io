			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the VIP restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grunny let the escort ignite a black, thick cigarette, take a deep breath, and then rudely sigh: "The music literate chick is really good. It’s much better than the few people who sent the gift before, but I can’t wait to get into my arms immediately.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Granius, I think Miss Reese doesn't seem to like you very much." His close guards whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granius laughed: "It’s just that you have a sense of accomplishment. You don’t feel that it’s great to conquer a reserved girl by your own charm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charm..." The close guard is speechless, but he is very clear, rude, uncultivated, nouveau riche, lust is just Granny’s boss. The protective color, otherwise he is one of the defenders of the underground order of Sterk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Grace came in from the door opened by the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grunny was busy pressing the cigarette in the ashtray, and then slightly confused: "Gress, how is your eyes a little red and swollen, who bullies "You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s just that during this time, in order to prepare for the concert, I often practice late at night, so I was just a little bit dry and painful by the cold wind." Grace After temporarily surpassing the most feared nightmare, facing Granny’s lies is easy and comfortable, without any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenyu’s puffy face showed a look of concern: “I will let my family doctor give me some medicine tonight to help you eliminate your eyes. Fatigue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Granny." Grace thanked him, reaching out with a smile and folding it tightly. The note was handed to Granny and the red wine was on his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grunny also thought that his efforts had achieved results. Although the reserved beauty did not dare to express his affection in person, he wrote a note to himself: "Hey, it’s romance to learn music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace gently took a sip of wine and watched Grinoff open the note, waiting for the opportunity When he is about to see the content but it has not yet fully expanded, he will slowly drop the glass of wine: "Mr. Grinoff, this is a gentleman who met in the bathroom and let me bring it to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Grannyf sees the contents of the note not being explained by himself, then the act of handing over the note just seems to be Mr. and Mr. Evans. There is a shallow relationship, not a strange mysterious person, but if you explain in advance, Granny Fough may not open it personally, and it is likely to be handed over to the guard. This violates Mr. Evans’s account. Therefore, the timing is the most important thing to grasp. And in similar things, Grace feels that women have a natural instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not for you to write..." Granny asked in amazement, while subconsciously folding the last layer and seeing a line of text on the note. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly his voice stopped abruptly, his face changed again and again, but he quickly returned to normal, smiling: "Oh, one always remembers hanging things." Guy. He really tried his best to find you. Right, Grace, what does he look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he It seems that it is not worth mentioning when burning a match to burn a note in an ashtray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past? Grace thought inexplicably, and then sorryly said: "Sorry, Mr. Granny, I don't know if my good heart will bring you trouble. Well, he is a black hair black..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very vague to describe the appearance itself in language, only to focus on a few features, and Grace has never thought about the true appearance of Mr. Evans. Come out, so when she finished describing, Granny only knows that it is a black-haired, dark-skinned, elegant and handsome young man, and the guy who fits this description can meet two or three in ten minutes in various high-end situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grunny didn’t care too much: “It’s okay, a little thing, don’t need to pay attention to him. Grace, we continue the romantic dinner. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the dark corner of the "Shark" restaurant, Lucien, who has changed part of his appearance with a magical "masking technique", quietly looks at Granny’s satin, golden color and gorgeous decoration. The boat sent Grace to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends, come out, don't be sneaky." Lucien suddenly regained his gaze and whispered to the empty alley of the narrow alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sneer inexplicably sounded, a black figure emerged from the wall: "The sneaky tracking and voyeur seems to be you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a middle-aged man with no cover, his face is thin and gloomy, his linen hair is draped over his shoulders, his brown eyes are icy and ruthless, not one of Granny’s side. A guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully at the handsome appearance of Lucien’s black hair, and nodded and said, “Are you a magician?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not change the color and color when using "masking", and guaranteed the main features, making himself as close as possible to another person. The possible description of the silk, let people look at this secret voyeur guy thinks that he should be the mysterious person who just handed the note: "Of course, if I am not a magician, how can I find Mr. Granny to arrange to go to Holm Kingdom? Aringe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When speaking, Lucien did not cover up the supernatural power fluctuations that are ready to go, so that experienced people can understand this as soon as they feel it. It is magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this gentleman, I think you made a mistake, Granny is not the liaison of the Magic Council." The man smiled. "I don't know where you heard this information. But in fact, I am one of the liaisons of the Magic Council in Stuart. Please call me 'the ferryman'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he added: "Because there are too many magicians like you to get the wrong information, we also keep track of Granny and monitor him around. It's easy to find and contact you. You see, I won't find you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face with a cover-up technique is slightly stiff, as if it’s been hanging With a faint smile, the explanation for this "ferryman" is a little bit unbelief. There is nothing too mysterious about Gilenov's note, just a note that ordinary magicians seek to contact and leave a meeting place. The only special thing is that Granny is called the Magic Council Liaison directly on the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the caution shown by Granny, Lucien estimates that he is not trustworthy, no one guarantees the way will not wait for any response, because He will worry that this is a temptation for the night watchman, so he will definitely not send people to meet. Otherwise, once someone went there to meet, according to the fact that the note was seen by him, Granny had a great suspicion. For the church, with this degree of suspicion, Granny's identity, status and the big nobility behind it can be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucian’s purpose was simply to alarm Granny and let him send people to secretly look around for the voyeur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow you to "find" yourself to the deliberately exposed person and determine the surveillance of no night watchers nearby, and even if you are a church person, as long as the "ferry" is not After being caught and tortured, Granny did not have a big suspicion. After all, if it wasn’t for Lucien that Felipe would face the “professor” of the same parliamentary headquarters, he would never lie on this kind of thing, maybe I really believe in the explanation of the "ferry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do I believe that you are the liaison of the Magic Council in Stourke?" Lucien used a slightly "excited, excited and doubtful" tone. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ferryman" smiled and said: "If you don't believe me, I will leave. Anyway, it is not me. You think, if I am the vigil of the church." People, you can do it now, why bother to deceive you a magician to go to other places? You know that once you get your hands on it, the night watchman can be unscrupulous, and you are different, you have to be distracted and worry about the time delay. Going down, so many priests, bishops, and night watchmen from Stourke will come one after another!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the magical fluctuations that Lucine deliberately revealed, he judged The approximate strength of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I believe in you." Lucian pretended to helplessly answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ferryman" shook his head: "You believe that I am useless. The question now is whether I should believe in you? There are many church night watchers." The rebellious magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
