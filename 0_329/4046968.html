			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "roasted fish hotel" in the night is as old as ever, and it looks like nothing has changed, but Fernando has not dared to approach, leaving a secret in the agreed position. After that, he turned into a nearby slum, hiding in a densely planted tree, quietly overlooking the broken house below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the silver moon rose to the top, a figure stepped on the clearing of the ground and quickly closed the broken house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando carefully checked the unmanned track and floated down from the tree, pressing the voice: "Old man, you are not dead yet!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am still alive when you are dead!" This figure is like Old Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the order of President Annoud, he continued to stay at the "Grilled Fish Hostel" and was responsible for contacting Sharp "Big Blue", but no longer participated in the union magician. Transit contact matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and turned to the topic: "Old man, telling Sharp, we decided to take over the task, assassinate Alfonso, I hope he can provide information about Alfonso Everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You really decided to assassinate Alfonso? Did you spread the madness to the president?" Old Green was surprised at him. It seems that this kind of thing is completely irritating the church, and there is no possibility of success, but it is easy to get on the whole union! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando glanced at Old Green with a sneer: "The coward is unable to understand the meaning of the adventure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It seems a bit of a grasp." Old Green lived two hundred years old, his vision and insights were extraordinary. He only noticed the change of the problem from a sneer of Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coward is very sensitive." Fernando has no noble character of respecting the old and loving the young. The owe is his main feature, but he is also from death and The magician who came out of the blood experienced not knowing how many times he was dangerous, so he would not forget to remind Old Green. "Don't let Sharp know that we are a bit sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a tone on "a bit", even if he faced Old Green, he did not say all the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green gave a smile: "Is this kind of rash person? But why would you look for Sharp to provide information, not afraid that he deliberately framed you or secretly notified? To the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we seduce Alfonso out, Sharp will surely realize that we have accepted the 'mission' and started to act if he will Notifying the church, it was the same at that time, so it is better to give him a little trust now, which is the basis of cooperation. It also saves time in collecting intelligence.” Initially, Fernando himself has been entangled in this, because of the president of Anord and Douglas said that he had no problem before he decided to come, but after careful consideration, he vaguely grasped the key points. It's just not as sturdy as the old fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the old fox also concealed something else, so I believe in the sincerity of Sharp cooperation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green nodded: "Sharp has been staying at the grilled fish hotel for two days, as if waiting for your reply, I will pass on your words to him now. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, there are these mathematical books and notes, which I and Douglas gave to Hathaway." Fernando will be a black cover. The book was handed to Old Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really want Hathaway to take the dangerous road of magic?" Because of the relationship between Hathaway's father, Old Green has never been this Agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled and said: "Hey. Can we force this kind of thing? Old man, let go of your worry, look at you still not dead, look for one Ms., give birth to a child of my own, don’t put extra love on the unneeded person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hides a faint concern in taunting in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green first said nothing, then sighed long: "I remember how cute a child when you first arrived at the Magic Tower. Energetic, stubborn and refined. You will be secretly crying when you are taught by your teacher. When is your mouth so stinky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn old guy!" In the end, Fernando could only curse a very quiet voice, fearing to alarm the people nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, Old Green returned, seriously speaking to Fernando: "Sharp promised to provide Alfonso's information, and I will hand it to you at this time tomorrow." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows what happens after we take over the task? What is the change in expression and breath?" Fernando asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green would not pay attention to these details, no need to think about it, and replied directly: "A little bit wrong, then keep a relaxed smile, um, still 骂One sentence, 'The arrogant, do not know how weak the mouse is, how do you die!'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando outlined the scenes at the time I didn't find Sharp's abnormality, so I nodded lightly: "I will hide in the hotel tomorrow, and secretly observe the process of giving him information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, The more careful the better, Fernando is not an inexperienced young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, here is the letter from Hathaway to you and Douglas. It should have been written in the last two days, and Sharp has been with him." Green pulled out a thick letter from his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us a letter? What will she write?" Fernando did not believe that he had been with him twice, and he and Douglas had a deep relationship with Hathaway. The friendship is therefore quite awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked it out with magic and carefully unfolded, only to see the words on the letter are beautiful and clear, except for the numeracy of the transcripts, the extra One word is not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Fernando can only laugh at this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, the sunset has not yet fallen, Fernando sneaked into The Grilled Fish Inn" hid in the kitchen behind the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour after dinner time, the nose of the nose seemed to have a tumor, and Sharp came alone and threw it to Old Green’s stack of crumpled paper: All the details I can understand are above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no stranger to the assassination, knowing which information works, after all, when the Church of Truth first rises, the Cavaliers cooperate It is common for clergy to assassinate a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Old Green looked at himself without saying a word, he snorted heavily: "If you suspect the authenticity of the information, go and verify it yourself, I am just Customer. Not a servant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he spread his hand: "Do you believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What letter?" Old Green stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reply to Hathaway, their actions may be very high. I haven’t responded in the past few days, I’m afraid I will never reply." Sharp is still the same. I can't look down on the strength of Fernando and others. Fernando, who was tempted by the kitchen, secretly clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green took out a letter full of answers and handed it to Sharp: "Do you really want to assassinate Alfonso?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly aware of the eagerness of Sharp’s attitude and the carelessness of deliberately pretending that it was a tacit understanding of many years, like Fernando could not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say?" Sharp did not respond positively, smiled and asked a question easily, and then took another letter from his arms. "This is the doubt after Hathaway learned yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando guess what type of content is inside without looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sharp drank a glass of spirits and ate a grilled fish, ready to leave, he suddenly smiled at the kitchen wall and squeezed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He found me..." After a while, Fernando walked out of the kitchen. Looking at the darkness where Sharp's back disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
