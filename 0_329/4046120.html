			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien bowed to the front of the stage and bowed to the box, but the thunderous applause was like the tide of water, not weakened, so that Lu Xien had to go again and again. Paying homage over and over again, saluting over and over again, exactly the same as Christopher’s curtain call yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary people in the municipal square without blood power and without the grace of the gods found that the applause was not enough to express their inner madness, the sadness under long-term depression. In order to cheer, I turned to scream and thoroughly vented. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the high society people who have status in the Hall of St., although not so mad, but the applause is also enduring, and the same unprecedented loudness. Because even the Cavaliers, even if they inspire their blood and have a strong will in the face of enemies, they are human beings, not gods, still have their own stories, with their own sorrow, joy, love, affection, pain and hatred. Music touches the softest part of the heart, and it will produce emotional resonance, and will express your emotions madly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The really beautiful, heart-felt music is never divided into high and low, regardless of ethnic beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the most devout devotees who have dedicated everything to the Lord are calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lucien after leaving the stage after countless number of curtain calls, the audience on the Municipal Square slowly calmed down, exhausted after the vent The peace of mind emerges at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this piano sonata is a little worse than the steadfastness of fate, it is the best piano sonata I have ever heard, no matter Is it a structure or a melody.” Piola saw the crystal wall slowly disappearing, while admiring it, while feeling inexplicably lost, it seems that I still want to hear it again. “The two works are always through the difficulties faced by Mr. Evans. Danger, face repression and grief never give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon smiles and sorrows before the break: "The past piano sonatas are their own connotations, Or the expressive power of music is very different from that of Mr. Evans. It is conceivable that the future sonatas will be modeled after "Sorrow". If you don't go to Aalto, how can we accept it so quickly? What's new in music concept?” The seven-month long trek seems to have yielded an unimaginable return at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder every Aalto Festival is a festival of music! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace looked intently at the disappearing crystal wall direction: "And Mr. Evans made the piano play itself become art, I have decided to learn Piano."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave a study in Aalto?" Piola hesitatedly asked Grace, "The Music Review" Symphony Herald Turck can only afford the upper aristocrats and musicians. Now we just have to go back to our hometown. With the ideas, structure and skills we learned from Mr. Evans concert today, we can definitely become a popular band and join the real The symphony orchestra, embark on the music path that belongs to us.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you stay in Aalto, how much money can you spend to find a teacher? And Aalto's outstanding musicians and musicians are too many. We are not Mr. Evans. There is no famous opportunity here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent Green said ahead of Grice's answer: "Follow us, Goris." Our Fantasia was guided by Mr. Evans. After the revision was completed according to his opinions, and the matter was announced, we could immediately become famous in Stourke. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although silence, it does not mean that Green does not have his own thoughts, and he can not let go of the things that musicians can quickly become famous.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it feels a little bad, Piola, Sharon, etc. have not refuted Green’s words, and even stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The expression on Grace’s face changed again and again, and finally thought of the relatives in his hometown, thinking of the bright future of Green’s depiction, and finally sighed and replied: “Then we bought the latest issue of Music Review and other newspapers. There must be a discussion about piano fingering skills and sonata genre. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others solemnly nodded. These newspapers not only represent the future of music, but also bring back a lot of money." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we become official... Traveling around the mainland, we will be able to find a place to study with peace of mind, no longer so depressed and painful." Sarah patted her sister's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith seriously nodded: "I didn't expect Mr. Evans to have so much pain. I seem to be able to feel his heart, but he is so determined and persistent. , will never give up in the face of difficulties, we must be like him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backs of the two brothers and sisters slowly disappeared into the crowd, while the other side of the wheat Both Kanz and Piero walked back like a lost soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Backstage of the St. John's Hall, Lucien untied the top button on the shirt and hugged the Rhine: "Thank you for your help, Otherwise, my concert could not have been so successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then slammed the whisper: "Mr. Rhein, can you tell me where I am now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine took a picture of Lucien’s shoulder and smiled and replied with a voice that no one could hear. “Do you think this place and atmosphere is suitable for discussing this issue? I will look for it tomorrow night. You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his voice went high: "Congratulations to Lucien, this concert shows everyone the direction of change and has gained a huge Success, you will become a true, authoritative and famous musician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cello Thomas and other Rhine and Lucien separate, also gave Lucien a hug: "Mr. Evans, last time I said that you will be the most famous musician in the whole continent, but I did not expect you to Fast success, congratulations, you will be the music legend of the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the band, the door is waiting for a knight attendant, he is coming to invite Lucy I went to the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s heart is a bit embarrassing. Can he be able to keep the identity of a magician in front of a pastor of the Holy Spirit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, you have moonlight and blood, you can cover up the magician's soul." Rhine pretends to pack up the instrument, passing behind Lucien, the sound is small It’s insignificant, “unless he already doubts you, check it directly with the gods.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the Rhine’s affirmation, Lucian regained calm, followed the knight The attendants came to the box of the big men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Even if you are just standing in front of the box, there are still a few steps away from Sarde, and Lucien can clearly feel the warmth. The light of the Holy Light, because sitting in front of him is a true Holy Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I am not the blood of the dark surname, nor the essence of the necromantic magic, otherwise I will be seriously injured if the soul of Sald shines. "The current strength of Lucien is more than the last time, and it is more able to speculate on the unfathomable strength of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien asked the big men to say hello, Grand Duke Ou Oli came over and took a shot with Lucien’s hands: "Your Music, your performance have a powerful force, I like it very much. Oh, if you are not my daughter's music consultant, I will definitely invite you to be the chief consultant of the court. I hope that you can continue to write such a beautiful music. As long as you can maintain this level, the future must be a master in the field of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha gave a ride to Lucien directly. Then he whispered in his ear: "What good ideas are you hiding in Lucien? Good things should be shared with good friends!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She obviously I was not able to show my charm in front of Silvia with such a performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be gone." Lucian answered a little slyly. I can't say that I am still a magic apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Natasha let go of Lucien, a smile that is rare and rare: "Your performance has reminded me of a lot of things that I thought I could forget, thank you. Lucien, even if they are sad, can be valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher smiled and walked to Lucien and looked good For a few tens of seconds, I finally embraced it with awkwardness: "My time is over, but you have let me see a new era coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
