			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---The happiest thing today is to push the list last week, although it is the last one, but in my mind, the top ten of the top page of the home page Five is almost equivalent to the top fifteen of the monthly ticket list. Only the great god can get it. Today, I can really go up. I am really very happy. I am very grateful to everyone. Please continue to recommend the ticket support~ Well, there is also the first book in the new book list. The first in Sanjiang, although it is because the big book of dancing is full of the list for a month, and it has not been forceful, but it can be ranked first, always satisfied and happy, and seek Sanjiang votes, at least in the dance seriously Before you get up, keep the first ~..........................................................................................<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucian, who wants to be a musician or musician to cover up his magician, there is nothing to hide in Pieru’s question. He smiles and replies: “I am currently Followed Mr. Victor to learn his modified harpsichord, well, Mr. Victor thinks The modified harpsichord is already a brand new, revolutionary surnamed instrument, named it as a piano, and will soon be registered with the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although he has been exposed to the magic apprentice circle, many of the items Lu Xien needs can be obtained from them with "knowledge", but Lucien's own knowledge is very problematic, and he can't go deep into his current identity. Always use knowledge to exchange items, or be as dangerous as running on the edge of a cliff, or you will soon be able to open up the knowledge you can speak, and use knowledge to exchange money, to become ordinary clothes, food, Houses, carriages, etc., also need a face-to-face, earningly rich career to cover up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the study of music, Lucien has always worked hard, even if there is enough time, such as the location of the mainland Magic Council headquarters after a few years. Wait, it becomes more useful to become a musician than to become a bard. After all, few people will doubt that a handsome musician who is graceful, talented, and able to write beautiful and intoxicating will be dark and evil. Ugly magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The harpsichord? Piano?" The expression on Pieru's face became vivid and excited, standing up, walking inside the bookshelf, turning circles Like looking for something, he finally knocked on his head, dragged a book from a shelf, and got it in front of Lucien. "Whether it is a harpsichord or a piano, you need In this book, I just watched this book to learn the harpsichord. After four months, I will participate in the assessment of the association's musicians and become a qualified musician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a guild, the Musicians Association, like other guilds, has controlled many things within the guild and monopolized it, such as the recognition of musicians. And the musicians who are subjective and idealistic, all look at the elegance of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Art of Harpsichord Performance." Lucien took over and looked at it politely thanking Piedru, anyway, staying up late last night, The spirit is very poor, can not resolve the magic in my mind, it is better to look at this book to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piero has not let go of Lucien’s meaning, and he is constantly talking to Lucien about the performance, music, and music of the harpsichord. Knowledge, etc., seems to know that after Lucian learned the piano, he has a feeling of finding a "companion", and he wants to share all his feelings about music, which is very crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s music for so long, it’s a bit of a foundation, and it’s barely confined to the discussion, but the eyelids can’t stop falling, full of sleepiness, and several The attempt to stop Piero from speaking was ignored by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, at this time, a woman wearing a black gauze hat and wearing a white elegant dress came out of the library. Her waist was not tightened by the belt. It can be born to be slender, and it is full of charm and manners. It is like a beautiful picture floating slowly from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she seems to wear white stockings with suspected stockings under her long skirt, and her legs are straight and slender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The world has stockings? Is it a by-product of alchemy? 】"Lu Xien has already developed a conditional launch. As long as he finds anything similar to the earth, he can't help but observe and speculate. In the eyes of this lady and Pieru, Lucien's gaze is a bit rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough. Piero woke up from the mad music state, coughed twice, and hit his hand on the elbow, let him not be rude, and smiled and said: "Ms. Sylvia, what do you need to help?" ? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia is often watched by similar eyes. She is used to it. She is not angry because of this. After she took down the black gauze cap, she said plainly to Pierou: "Hello, Pierou, I am borrowing a few books. They are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is as beautiful as the one described by Pieru, with a long black hair and silky long hair and a deep night sky. With the slightly raised eyes, the small and straight nose gives a gentle and elegant feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pieru didn’t expect Sylvia to remember his name, excitedly turned red, said good, then walked quickly to the bookshelf, looking for Sylvia needs books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Sylvia stood in front of the wooden cabinet, Lucien smelled a faint, seemingly familiar scent: [I was at the time Is the 'black nightingale' yarn her? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enhancement of the soul, Lucien’s memory is getting better and better, and soon I think of the first bucket of gold that I got rid of. Then, I glanced at the black gauze hat held in Sylvia's hand, and my heart secretly speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after Lucian carefully distinguished it, he felt that it was wrong: [The scent is very similar, but it still differs. It seems to be using the same perfume, or the powder. Different ladies. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter, Lucien was only a little curious, did not find the lady to find out, can not always say to her: "You Ok, the cap you lost is sold by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the tension, because of the excitement, because of the desire to perform in front of Sylvia, Pierou I was so helpless that I completely forgot which books were placed on which bookshelf. After a few minutes, he did not find any one, and his face was still red, but it was no longer because of excitement, but panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, because Pirulu could not return with the book for a long time, Lucien couldn’t help but look back and saw him red-faced and asked for help. The gaze, then smiled and shook his head, walked to a bookshelf, and took a handful of papers that Sylvia needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only because Lucien’s memory is very good, but also because Lucien has already included the books and materials in this music library into his own soul. The library, and the bookshelves formed, arranged in the direction of Lucien, completely follow the reality of this library, so as long as you think about it in your mind, you can immediately find the bookshelf and location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time, Pieru did not care, just full of gratitude, can see Lu Xien did not pause, did not hesitate, went to several consecutive In front of the bookshelf, the books needed by Sylvia were taken out, and his mouth was a bit close: "When did he become so familiar with the library?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Holding a stack of books in front of Sylvia, Lucien asked politely: "Ms. Sylvia, are you looking here, or am I going to help you in your lounge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that this kind of stunning woman in Sylvia, Lucian does not have a man’s mind, it must be fake, but Lucien is sober and sensible. Knowing the identity of his magician and his plans to go to the mainland Magic Council headquarters in the future, it is impossible to allow himself to pursue romance and love in Aalto. Therefore, without expectation, there is no excitement and tension, and performance in front of Sylvia. Very calm and calm, and a strong contrast with Piero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You register, put it on the table, and so on, someone will help me." Sylvia sounds low, slightly hoarse, with a unique surname sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a bit strange. I just stared at the wretched satyr I watched on my legs, but now I’m acting like a man and not a woman. "Gentleman", but this strange, not enough to make her curious about Lucien, just waiting for Lucien to register, casually asked: "What is your name, which gentleman's student?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being able to do this job, there must be a relationship in the association, Sylvia still has to show basic courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Sylvia, I am Mr. Victor's student Lucian Evans." Lucian simply replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia smiled slightly, like a delicate lily: "I heard that Mr. Victor has transformed a brand new instrument piano, I I am looking forward to his concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
