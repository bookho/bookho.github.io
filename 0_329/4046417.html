			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s call, the emotion is complicated to the extreme, fearing his own conspiracy to provoke the thunder and anger, so the subconscious pray for judgment errors, and strongly hope that it is true I hope that my father can save himself from this abominable magician, no longer worry about being killed and murderous, no need to do dangerous and painful "experimental assistant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bayer turned to look at her and gently beheaded: "All conspiracy must be based on strength. Do you understand this now? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is actually the imperial emperor Rudolph II, the legendary strongman who is not weaker than the Arcanist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his body is clearly Bayer, how to get through the Nuremberg and other day Knights check? Does he also have a deformed mask? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his current atmosphere does not seem to have a legendary feeling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, facing a legend, Lucien is an unprecedented tension, hormones are secretly secreted, the body is slightly trembling, and the brain is more awake, reaching out The right hand in the storage bag is pulled out a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II took a look at Lucien, his eyes continued to gaze above the statue, and looked like a self-deprecating air toward the front: "I didn't even find it." There is also a high-ranking magician who is in, your camouflage ability is very good, not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his attitude is proud, no one is intentive, but not aggressive, The signs of imminent hands, Lu Xien also do not want to rush to attack, high-altitude efforts while making the sound smooth: "I have not found the Great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Starting from here, stepping into the unprecedented peak of the shrine family, naturally find a time to come back and observe what the gorse family still hides to determine the future direction, but unexpectedly, but inexplicably you gave me a surprise. "Rudolph II has a straight back, his hands behind him, his eyes looking straight ahead at the statue of Tanos, and he said honestly, there seems to be nothing to fear, no secrets worthy of concealing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not as relaxed as he is, nervous and fearful, so that the muscles are sore, so that they can maintain a good state and can cope with changes that occur at any time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Rudolf II say this, Lucien was shocked: "Is the Emperor also promoted the legend by integrating the devil projection?" This is more than I imagined. The ritual effect is exaggerated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Rudolph II sneered: "I am like a dark and wretched person like Ulrich?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stupid guys only see the benefits of a fusion of devil projections, and people like me and Tanos can be influenced by greed and discover the inner essence through superficial phenomena. Find your own path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world is destined to belong to people like us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; arrogant domineering, extremely confident, Rudolph II did not hide this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien savored the words of Rudolf II, and suddenly his heart moved: "The Great Emperor, like the greed, hateful, painful devil, pre-projected to Prince Baier’s mind or soul, so he passed the inspection of the Duke of the gorse, and when he was at a critical moment, he could occupy and desecrate the body of Prince Baier like the devil, and gain strength?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II slowly turned his head and looked at Lucien for the first time since he came in. Then he slightly decapitated: "Very sharp, very smart, though wrong. Place, but roughly this is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not point out where Lucien guessed wrong, which may be related to deeper secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart is full of horror, what kind of road Rudolf II has embarked on, actually can turn himself into a greedy, devilish devil But there is no "evil" "exotic" existence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing this secret yourself, will it be ruined by Rudolf II? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fear of nervousness, Lucien seems to be able to hear the sound of his heart beating, but this does not affect Lucian’s thinking. Judgment and determination, even if there is no hope, I will not give up, will go forward, strive to create new hopes, and never yield to fate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia under the statue stared at her father and talked calmly with the mysterious magician. She didn't understand why it was so. Until then, she was awake, her father was not far away, and the legendary power was strong enough at this distance. Protecting himself, so the voice is sharp, full of grievances and hateful cry: "Father, he, he wants to kill me, but also let me do the dangerous thing to the extreme, you kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most hated guy she has ever lived to! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked by her voice, almost out of control and preemptive, but still hard to stop living, focused on the reaction of Rudolph II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II looked at Sophia with a faint look: "You didn't see it? After I projected it on Bayer, there were only seven or eight levels of knights. What do you want to kill him? Under the influence of power, are you sure you can survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien almost smashed the face of Rudolph II Spit, can you speak straight? The emperor’s Majesty is really frank to almost the same kind of cute, still want to let himself relax, so take the opportunity to attack? If it is the latter, is it necessary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was sure to kill you, but the nine-ring magic released by the cast material made me a little scared. Is it the latest achievement of the Magic Council?" Rudolf II continued his own style of frankness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale justice in the hands of Lucien, he is not very concerned about his mind, barely count him as an epic knight, even if the projection is only seven or eight strength, There is no fear that he will be shackled. Besides, he is not an "evil" creature. The pale justice is only equivalent to the level 8 knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently and confirmed Rudolf II’s guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II nodded thoughtfully: "The principle of my work has always been simple, not much to kill you, so I chose not to do it. So that Sophia and Bayer will be killed, but if you are arrogant and have to fight, I don't mind letting you know. The son's daughter is dead and can be regenerated, and the projection is not subject to minor injuries, and you Can you afford such a loss? You are not a lich, nor a mage. Sophia, come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia hoisted the heart again, afraid Looking at Lucien, worried that he would go to extremes, at the same time, she step by step, slowly moved to Rudolf II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien weighed the pros and cons, combined with his own judgment on the current situation of Rudolf II, and slammed the intention of holding Sophia threatening him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia finally moved to Rudolph II and really relaxed, tears in his eyes, his legs soft, and his body trembled with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You made two mistakes in this plan. One is that your own strength is not enough, or that your direct loyalty to you is not enough. You have to rely on Miranda for the last time. In the clearance field, he handed his safety to a partner who could not fully believe, and the second chose to cooperate with Ulrich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a spit The core of the snake, all the plans made to benefit him, but will not bring him too much danger, as for the safety of the partner, it is not his consideration. In this regard, you should be to him Study, as a qualified conspiracy, you should not be in the palace at this time, but should be in the basement outside, safely pretending to be anxiously rescued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the pain of the end of Miranda's life, it is hidden by this special underground palace, and then it is triggered by the extreme pain of Andris. It is an unexpected change of things. It is not something you can think of in advance. It can only rely on Ur. The means like Lich evade in advance."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rudolf II actually opened the analysis of the failure of Sophia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia looked at him blankly: "Father, father, don't you blame me, don't blame me for killing my brother, don't you blame me for killing so many noble children?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young griffins can only grow in iron and blood." Rudolf II replied briefly, "But your legacy must be thought of by yourself." "The solution is solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia understands that in the case of his father’s projection in advance, this conspiracy will not kill his brother Bayer, think of it, she will endure I couldn’t help but look back at the mysterious magician in the center of the hall. My heart suddenly mourned, why my own conspiracy will become a “child” game under the two “adults” and “supervision”, although many people died. "Children" game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
