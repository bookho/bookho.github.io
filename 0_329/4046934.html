			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami's joints seem to be rusty and stiff, and the posture is strange, but his speed is not slow, and he quickly walks to the door, pulling The door to the bedroom was opened and stepped into the hallway where only the dim light was left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's see the past." Carl repeated it, then agile like a black cheetah but quietly behind Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas in Donnie’s mind. When he first encountered this situation, he couldn’t figure it out for a while, but he couldn’t worry that his friend had to follow Carl. Hanging Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, Sami, who was closed with his eyes, got into the stairwell and walked downstairs half-jumping, but he was beating, but Quiet, as if every step of the stairs has become soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of surprise is matched with the faint and gloomy scene of the stairwell, which makes Donnie erect, and whispers to Karl: "He seems to have no consciousness, only knows Instinctively move forward, otherwise he will choose the lift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bedroom is on the second floor of the "Tower of Life", with a lift directly to the hall, basement And other floors, so the stairwell is rarely used, so that the magic chandelier has destroyed a lot and nobody cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car looked at Sami, who passed around the corner of the stairs, and the voice suddenly sounded in Donnie’s heart: "Maybe it is not willing to choose the lift..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny was shocked. Where did the voice come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can talk directly to the heart, without saying anything..." Carl said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie thought, this is the effect of a piece of jewelry on his body? It’s a teenager with a big background! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he groaned: "I don't want to choose? Do you mean that Sami was manipulated?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily. Perhaps what is calling him, or perhaps as you said, is just an instinctive action." Carl's eyes twitched slightly and crept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stairwell, two magical chandeliers broke down by half, the light flickered, and there was a terrible feeling. Downey was dignified and panicked: "Then we quickly reported the teacher and asked them to be dealt with by the official magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to the guardian of the "Tower of Life". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light and shadow changes, Carl White’s exquisite face was stained with a hint of gloom: “No. If Sami is just a special sleepwalking caused by ghosts, then we ourselves It can be dealt with, and the teacher will instead 'scare' him, and if he is really being manipulated, here is the Heidler School of Magic. It is under the control of the locks everywhere. As long as there are spell fluctuations or other movements. The lock will immediately be inductive. At that time, the high-ranking mage who guards the lock center must have time to stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After years of development. The Necromancer medical field has a complete classification of the disease, and named a number of common diseases that were previously covered in strange colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to look at Downey, the silver-purple eyes were a little nervous, with a little excitement, curiosity and eagerness to try: "You don't want to be in danger. Under the circumstance of an adventure? Don't want to deal with this thing with your own ability? Perhaps the last place Sami went, there is a huge treasure hidden, hiding the power to dominate a country..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnetic voice continues to echo in Donnie’s heart. Although this discourse is not sufficiently streamlined, it seems to contain some kind of irresistible force that is hard to resist and successfully inspires Downey’s heart. **, let him subconsciously nod and step forward with Karl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it called? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it like me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny slightly confused, seemingly dominated by Karl, and walked out of the "Tower of Life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no difference between day and night in the spirit world, it is always a monotonous black and white gray, but in the lock of the Heidel School of Magic, it has different brightness The change is convenient for the apprentice who has not yet become a formal mage to fall asleep smoothly. Therefore, after walking out of the "Tower of Life", Downey only feels quiet and dark, surrounded by the bottom of a huge magic tower, and if he looks up, Seeing the spider web like a flyover and a dead "sky", there is no silver moon, no stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't lose it." Carl reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donnieph nodded for fear and nervousness, clearly hearing a hint of excitement in Carl’s voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quietness and darkness of this kind of silence, the three people bypassed the magic tower, one after the other close to the main entrance of the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Heidler Academy is like a city of magic towers, surrounded by tall, strong, long walls, the so-called gate is tens of meters high, A gray-white light curtain with a width of ten meters wide, with a strange magic pattern flowing above it, filled with a strong death atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami, who saw his eyes closed and his face muscles twisted, stopped in front of the main entrance. Downey was half-hearted and confused in his heart conversation. "Does Sami think of going outside the college?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably, maybe, maybe, anyway, we have been following, I will definitely find interesting things, I will tell you Ah, once, I took my brother to an ancient tomb in the middle of the night..." Carl's voice was more and more exciting, but his slap in the face did not distract him, still staring at Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny strangely said: "Sami can't get out, the main entrance is closed, what fun things will happen? Are we still trying to wake him up? Or wait He went back to his bedroom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, his eyes bulged out, only Sami extended his right hand and gently pressed the main door light curtain Above, then, with his palm as the center, swaying ripples around the circle, swallowing his whole person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Out, out, go out..." Downey stuttered, the defensive effect of the lock? What is the high-level mentor of the guard center? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow up, or else you can't go!" Carl didn't care for him, grabbed his right hand and rushed to the magic steam train. Slowly shrinking vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey only felt a huge force coming from him, and he couldn’t help but “fly” to the main entrance, just like when he was a child who was flying by a bull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His strength is bigger than I thought! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of cold and soaking came, and the colors in front of Downey all faded. Only black, white, and foggy grays depict everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tomb in his pupil, and the black tombstones in front of the tomb were all slanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Downey’s sudden beating, once again had the sense of being summoned in the previous nightmare, the footsteps moved uncontrollably, following the front Sami walked toward the center of the "eternal cemetery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger! It is the core of the "Life Return Ceremony" and it is definitely dangerous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already left the main entrance and entered the realm of the dead. Once there is any accident, the instructors can't wait for the rescue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s instinct to make him make a quick decision. Shouted loudly. Trying to get the attention of the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his call did not arouse even a little voice, and it was still dead and solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world of the dead, here is the legendary soulless world below the legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to cast spells. Make a big move. Can be under that call. He couldn't concentrate on his strength, he could only listen to his heartbeat faster and more frightened, and watched his footsteps move more and more uncontrollably. Feeling the inner heart is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl, it’s dangerous ahead, find a mentor." He tried to remind Carl through a spiritual exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downey talked about his dreams over and over again, but Carl still had no tension and continued to follow Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the "familiar" giant tomb appeared in Downey’s eyes, he desperately gave up persuasion and obeyed the summoning and inner ** Go forward with Carl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no pause in front of Sami, directly into the tomb that covered the door, and Karl paused for a moment, then followed the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomb door, ramp, floor tile... exactly the same as Donnie’s “memory”, but just around the corner, he was shocked and saw a team wrapped around The mummies with the "grey" strips came over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no guard in the nightmare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s heart is jumping out of the chest fiercely, and the feeling of despair is born, knowing that the worst mummies also have the level of a formal knight. The mummies in front of them are terrifying, and the "clothes" are soaked with grease, which is obviously not a general mummies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously stepped back, and felt the presence of Karl, only to see his silver-purple eyes become sharp and his expression was extremely dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he has the power of a dragon and a strong ornament, should he be able to block the mummy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the team mummies did not care about them, and walked directly from them, without any action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be?" Downey muttered suspiciously. The danger just now allowed him to concentrate and prepare for the spell. He almost started to attack the mummies. The attack, who knows, the mummy does not seem to see both of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s weird." Carl’s rare words are concise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s weird, when did you have the talent that was neglected?" The duck-like voice screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who!" Downey was shocked again, when was there a person behind him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty helplessly said: "I am coming with you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie takes out The notebook that I carried with me turned over the above record (whoever met the familiar fat man, he regarded him as a roommate Jones), and smiled bitterly: "Don't follow this again without following the movement."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have it..." The fat man is very wronged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go." The tension in Carl's voice is more pronounced, and the same is true of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the martyrdom, they continued on, all the way, met the floating ghost, met the dragon lich who had a pale flame in his eyes, met The strange undead creatures made up of countless pieces of meat, but they all turn a blind eye to Downey and others, as if the two sides are in different worlds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is the main burial chamber. Downey thought strangely. After entering, is there really a horrible undead, an undead creature composed of countless intelligent lives? ? It is also impossible to see yourself and others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this stage, he has no control over his "summoned sense", and Carl and Jones seem to have been overwhelmed by curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the door of the main burial chamber, Downey’s pupil suddenly shrunk, because Sami is standing in front of the dark, huge cockroach, facing himself and others. The eyes are closed and the mouth is smiling with a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sami!" Downey blurted out, but the voice could not ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Sami’s back cover slammed open, black gas rose, and the terror of the nightmare reappeared in Downey’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be taller than the giant, more secretive than sewing the corpse, more pure than the dead world... The eyes of this undead creature slammed open, the dark red flame jumped Come out, rich deaths come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
