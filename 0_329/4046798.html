			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Grand Theatre of the Kingdom of Lent, the aristocrats and magicians who admire the curtains are whispering, and there are many different forms of opera that are different from the past. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the opera, the structure of the division is the mainstream without any doubts. Even if someone has made improvements, it is only a fine-tuning. No one dares to directly Abandoning the traditional mode of unusual success, and the aristocrats and civilians of the Holm Kingdom have become accustomed to this kind of opera, like a single solo, chorus, like an impact or appealing aria, as for opera The plot content that they want to express, they often only know about it, can be used to understand the emotions behind singing and music, and other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the more detailed plots and more specific classic dialogues, they are basically fully known and later passed on by the same name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a big problem in the past when the storyline is relatively simple and not compact. It does not prevent them from enjoying the opera, enjoying the music, singing and basic stories, but with With the development of drama, the playwrights, including the great men such as Oliver, have created more rich and twisting stories. When people listen to opera, they often have some songs that are independent of the plot and are purely showing themselves. The feeling of skill, music and stories began to get out of touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this contradiction is still in the development stage, and it has not yet reached the critical point where change must be made, so today I heard the creation of Lucien Evans. After the first act of "Wusu", they were difficult to adapt at the moment, forgot to listen to the etiquette of the opera, and the discussion was very enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whole scene is a big piece?" The Duke of James, Stephanie, talked to the nearby Duke, Jane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple black hair has a little natural volume and is docilely draped over the shoulder. It's like the feeling she gives herself – in the aristocratic circle, she is called a “quiet doll”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking is a part of the music, I think it is more like a symphony, the theme is the content of the prelude. Moreover, the demarcation of the recital and the aria seems to be It became blurred. The classic monologue that only the princess fled into the woods was an aria that I could confirm. At other times, the characteristics of the two seemed to be confused..." Jane introduced the story to Stephanie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous opera, she first felt that the storyline and the music melody were so harmonious. Although there were too many incompatibility, the whole person was fully engaged. The atmosphere they co-created, the princess's experience, the new king who hated the brutality. Hate the insidious prime minister. Sympathetic servant maids. Under such feelings, every song sings, every melody. . They seem to ring in their own hearts, constantly pounding their own atrium, extraordinarily beautiful and full of appeal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the curtain of the curtain rang, Jane slowly recalled the opera just now, and sang on the improvement inside, such as some recitations and more singing. Nature, and the aria sometimes comes with the characteristics of recitation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephanie and the Duke of James next to her quietly listened to Jane’s introduction, funny and relieved Authentic: "A scene is a symphony? It is a master of Evans who was born in Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symphony's light concealed everything else, and they talked about it When playing music. I prefer to call Lu Xien as a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the heated discussion, the nobles all had their own opinions. Most of them thought that although they were a little uncomfortable, at least so far, "Valkyrie" was the first. The curtain is still above the standard. After the princess escaped from danger, he recalled his parents, maids and enemies. The aria that feels his own situation is enough to be called a classic. It is a rare song that has rarely been seen in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master is really a master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, in the face of Oliver’s question, Lucien told him his smile, and he was very proud of it, although this improvement was Mr. Wagner on Earth came to the reform of the opera, but the plot, melody, song and structural design of the opera were created by themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having listened to Lucien’s answer, Oliver snorted and then smiled and said: “I like this idea very much. Music and singing should serve the content of the story. The musicians who used to edit the opera for my script just can't understand the simple and understandable truth. I can't always create an opera that everyone is satisfied with, so I have always disliked their adaptation, if I can cooperate with you earlier. Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to Natasha glaring at the princess's monologue, Fernando tapped the handrail, seemingly looking forward to the beginning of the next scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small town Samara, Baroque Baron Square, other book friends Looking at:. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a subversion of the past form of the opera, the citizens suddenly fell silent, to say bad, just listen to the first act, they and others are completely Immersed in it, being told by the characters, being met by the characters, being melodious by the melody of the music, and being sung by the singer, I have to say good, always feel weird, the opera should not be like this. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is definitely the trend of opera development. 'Atomic control' is a master of music. Is his vision comparable to us?" An avid symphony The fans suddenly said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice broke the short-term solidification, and the citizens made a noise:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Yes, how can our knowledge compare to the big musicians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The opera just did better than before, well, it’s much better!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original top singer and opera actor is like this, there is no way to hear it in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The money they play once is enough for you to earn a year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Banus looked at the magnificent Grand Theatre of the Kingdom on the curtain, and it was rare: "I used to think that I can see and hear the best singers and opera performers before. The nobles have the right, but now, everything is so easy to achieve. We can actually see the opera in the Grand Theatre in Samara. The magic is amazing. And it brings the change. Actually, we can enjoy it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I am looking forward to the 'magic civilization' propaganda of 'Sound of Mystery', maybe we will not use it in the future. Going out, you can also see the situation of Rentat. Maybe..." The images and sounds on the "curtain" are constantly changing, making Ali's eyes obsessed. This is the power of the gods that the church preached in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the earth-shaking changes brought about by magic, thinking of the changes around, Ali is a little depressed, everything is developing rapidly, and what about himself? Stay in a small town forever, and grow old with no surprises like fathers and grandfathers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prelude to the second act of "The Valkyrie" began to sound, and there was a warm feeling in the fierce and tense, which made people look forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene. Princess Amantha suffered a lot of danger in the forest. Gradually grew into a real knight. Then, in a great disparity in the pursuit of power, she fell off the cliff. Suffering serious injuries, he almost died, but was saved by a powerful knight passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knight is a young and handsome man who sympathizes with the princess’s experience and stays to teach the princess to work with her to deal with the king’s pursuit. In the experience of going through the storm again and again, the two hearts slowly approached, gradually sparking the spark of love, and dyed a layer of intense and intense atmosphere that made people feel warm from the heart. Let the audience seem to find power and support and start looking forward to a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the love song of a male and female chorus, the second act slowly came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali listened to the opera while watching the "live" in the drama hall with a little picture, watching the one nobleman, his face was sweet Smile, is she listening to the opera, is it because of the love story of the princess and the knight, and feels warm and peaceful, even if there are more dangers, there is a solid back that can rely on each other, is it also remembered every The quiet and comfortable mood when I wrote the letter...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fantasized a lot, and after the second act, his mouth sang the song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third act was carried out in a prelude to the exuberant but seemingly dangerous storm. The princess and the knight embarked on the journey of rejuvenation, they knew A companion, found a knight still loyal to the old king, in the process, also indispensable danger, which makes a blonde knight also fell in love with the princess, and broke the left arm for the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the audience worried about the deterioration of love, the princess responded with an aria: "...you are as perfect as the sun, but not what I like and expect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the test of love, the princess seems to be more mature. With the lover, the Knights are attacked by the new king and the prime minister. This is a story of melody, the increasingly determined princess defeated the enemy, the music in the triumph The audience will hate the three bad guys hanging on the gallows, and other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the hidden storm fell, the wind whistled, the thunder roared, and the new king’s temporary curse revealed the identity of the princess’s lover. It is the prince of a neighboring country. He wants to use the princess's restoration to occupy this country! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this process, love is beyond control, but he finally chose his own country, in the thunder of drums, the horn sounds In the sound of riding and cheering, the two pulled out their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before sweet love..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience felt a kind of painful pain at the end of the third act. Ali was even awkward and looked pale at the Grand Theatre. It seemed to be able to feel the princess’s mood. That is a gap that cannot be crossed. It is a tie that must be cut off by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prelude to the beginning of the fourth act is a powerful and intense explosion in the depression of depression, which seems to be a sign of the princess's charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of music is the most classic period since the performance of "Valkyrie", which violently mobilized the mood and enthusiasm of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light is this piece of music, this opera can be called a classic..." Oliver agreed to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the princess and the prince ended, the prince fell to the ground, sang a beautiful monologue, and the princess raised a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you kill him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It won't be so cruel..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the uncontrollable voice, Natasha in the box suddenly sighed long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword fell, the prince died, a mournful tragic melody played, and the princess sang a sigh of sadness and not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And witnessed the sword, the face of Ali who heard this melody is gray, which seems to indicate the ending of his inner fantasy, his distance from her The distance between the neighboring king and the princess is far away, the story has ended before it has begun, and she does not need to swing her sword because she has no chance to play...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tragedy of love is particularly sad, and the princess who throws this sword keeps everyone in mind, and at this time, the tense and repressed melody sounds again, and the follow-up knights of neighboring countries have arrived. Become a captive of darkness and become a servant of a dragon. The country they want to occupy the princess is the treasure that the dragon needs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess restrained his grief and led the Knights to meet again. Just as they were about to win, the wind of the instrument imitated, a huge monster descended. On stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a lizard-like head, a strong body, covered with transparent scales, and the same beautiful transparent wings behind it, under the light, They flashed the brilliance of cold dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It exudes unimaginable majesty, allowing the group of operas to fall to the ground and sing intermittently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, true dragon?" The aristocrats of the theater must look out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus and Ali and others have forgotten to close their mouths, this is also a opera actor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon has ten fingers wearing different gemstone rings, a crown of hair, and a cloak with gold, a full robbery The appearance of the treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
