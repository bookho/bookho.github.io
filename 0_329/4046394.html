			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fincks, the first in the history of the Sphinx to get all the tribes to surrender, opened the legendary powerhouse of the Golden Age of the Sphinx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the era when it was active, there were still many more powerful characters, but it is indeed a legend without a doubt, Lu Xien is far away Unable to counterbalance the existence, and after it has been "resurrected" after 10,000 years of "death", what happened to it is also unimaginable by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape, this is the first thought that Lucien has flashed in his mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the only thought of a high-level magician facing a legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just two steps, Lu Xi's thoughts rolled over, exhausted the will of the whole body to overcome his subconscious reaction, and hard to stop the impulse to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape? Where to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directly going out will definitely alarm the priest of the ninth level, and he can easily defeat himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneak out and sneak out? Is it time to come, can you leave the mausoleum before Finks completely "resurrected" and leave the scope that it will cover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking for the gap between the dead spirits in the neighborhood? No, inside is the projection of the mausoleum. The reason why Finks can be resurrected must exist in it. It is the most dangerous direction now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the space jump reel given by the teacher to escape? Although this has declared the failure of the mission, and the palace's legal array and the tumultuous black air are related to space, the jump is likely to be disturbed and unexpected changes occur, but it is the only viable surname. Escape method! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a few hesitations, Lucien took out the reel and fired it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...sleeping...10,000...year, still...by being banned...in...here...you... dare... ... alarmed... I... you... this is... self-seeking... dead road..." The voice of the king of the Sphinx is full of sinful dryness, as if a decaying piece of wood is slowly breaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait a minute, Lucien suddenly noticed a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forbidden"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finx is being held here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s sleeping, its resurrection is it itself unable to intervene? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, a banned legend seems to be no longer so powerful and impeccable, and there is a glimmer of hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventure factor hidden in the bones of Lucien makes his heart beat more and more slowly, holding the scroll in his left hand, calmly sensing the recovery of the extreme evil power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too slow! The speed of power recovery is too slow! Not in the case of "normal resurrection", the growth of the evil atmosphere is firm but extremely slow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement has been revival for tens of thousands of years, so simple rituals and pressure can affect the completion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least thirty seconds to reach the legendary atmosphere." Lucien is not at all dangerous, very indifferent to judge, and then read The mantra is added to the "brute force", and after the buffer, the "Bully Force" is released. Finally, in order to seek insurance, a tube of "Fire Giant's Double Boxing" is taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this time out is more dangerous, Lucien exchanged a lot of materials and various useful medicines for the magic array, and mortgaged the annuity income to the teacher Fernando. The extra arcane points that were obtained were squandered, but whoever knew that they entered the night plateau had used a large amount of material to trap Count Vlad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lucien have to sigh, this is the war of money, of course, the value of materials and pharmacy is much less than what is obtained from the treasure house of the Rhine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are twenty-one seconds..." The strength of the expansion made Lucien feel uncontrollable, and the body became extremely cumbersome, but there was no way to take other potions that enhanced agility, balance, and reaction. "Cat's elegance" makes you a little lighter - like the high-end pharmacy of "Fire Giant's Double Boxing", no big knight's body can't be taken twice in a row, and the powerful magical power contained in it will give The flesh brings the impact of destroying the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"19 seconds, 18 seconds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien mouth grabs the scroll Take out an ordinary sword from the storage bag and hold the hilt with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A warm feeling came back from the wooden handguards, giving Lucien a little horror, helplessness, fear of dissipating, leaving only the rest Self-will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold...the mortal...I...want...let you...become...I...eternal...the slave... ...no matter...live...or...death..." The anger in Finks's emotions became more and more obvious, and the confidence in his strength and the joy of "resurrection" were clearly expressed in the sharp, sharp, glassy sharpness. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it still has no signs of leaving the Golden Jubilee and attacking Lutheran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very consistent with Lucien’s speculation that it was “banned”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don't know if it can get rid of the shackles when it returns to its legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"15 seconds, 14 seconds... I have to give five seconds to fire the reel as the final choice."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sensed the slow recovery of the evil atmosphere, counting the seconds of time passing by, taking the still heavy steps, and once again before the golden age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...have...from...sleep...in...recovery...return..." Finks is getting louder and louder The echoes of the bursts and the sorrows of the black air have signs of spreading beyond the gates of the Holy One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve seconds, eleven seconds... This time directly said that 'I'mback' seems to be more sensational, more legendary and powerful." Even in an unusually calm state, Lucien is filled with all sorts of weird ideas, but it will not let them affect their judgments and actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the golden urn, the lid was pushed to the side, and a layer of rich black ink covered the body of Finks, and Lucien lifted it up. "Pale justice", exhausted all strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no bright light, no amazing momentum, the ordinary sword body with a slight flash of metallic luster on the rich black air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable gentle and firm colors flashed past, black air like snow and ice met the sun, quickly melted apart, revealing the sphinx mummy lying inside . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is full of two or three sphinxes, wearing a gold crown with sun stones and moonstones on their heads, and pure on their faces and bodies. The white bandage reveals only a pair of narrow eyes, and the inside glows with faint icy light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...from...death...return to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth is not open However, there was a banging evil voice, but the words were not finished, and the "pale justice" was straight on its face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pale Justice” suddenly burst into a powerful momentum, firm and persistent, orderly and fair, never returning, never shrinking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...come...ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finchs made a scream, Under the "ordinary luster" sword, a pure white bandage split open, revealing the decaying pale muscles below. The brown-yellow sphinx has become a black, filthy filament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotten white muscles were opened, a stinky cockroach The yellow liquid flows out and evaporates quickly under the blade without dazzling brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
