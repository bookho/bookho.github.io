			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien politely but not timidly replied: "I am John's friend Lucian, he has an urgent matter at home, I come to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian with dark yellow hair snorted coldly: "John and other knights are attending, receiving training from Sir Wien, I am not sure you are his friend. Before, you won't interrupt them. You either prove your identity or wait patiently for them to complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rapid progress, appreciated by Sir Wien John, Ian, a hundred look down, very annoying, think that he is only a poor person, does not understand the words, but rely on the clever, everywhere to abide by the pedantic Knights Code to please Sir Wien, completely less than their own education, strength, So I heard that it was John's business, and Ian couldn't help but get upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other attendant Dorag also disliked John, smiling and watching Ian "learning" Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they will never admit that their hate and dislike are because of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Ian looked sternly at Lucian, and in his thoughts, Lucien, the poor who had never seen the world, was This knight attendant is so scared that he must be anxious and anxious and can’t refute. He can only plead with himself. When he asks for enough, he will send someone to look for John. There will be no major events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Lucien experienced far more than Ian, even outside his imagination, not only did not rush, but pleaded Instead, he smiled solemnly and solemnly: "John's friend is in a hurry and is in danger. If he slows down and returns, it will cause irreparable results. Your blockade is the main reason, and this is a serious violation of the spirit of knight pity. The behavior, I believe that Sir Wien knows, will be very angry, the consequences are very serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From John's mouth, Lucien knows that Sir Wien is a The aristocrats who strictly abide by the knight's way, as it is described by Lucien, will definitely dispel Ian and Dorag, and the exiled attendants will be completely destroyed, unless there are other opportunities, they will not be able to be Other knights accepted as attendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for John’s urgent friend, of course, Lucien himself, for the lack of a knight, the little good lies are not at all And, strictly speaking, this is not a lie, at most it is unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you dare to threaten me?!" Ian violently thundered, not thinking that he was so calm and coldly told by a low-lying poor, can’t wait to pull out his own The knight's sword, he cut a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-ranking knight attendant, the angry Ian stepped forward and exuded a dangerous momentum, which Lucien once felt in Gary. The complete outburst of the pressure, so that the soldiers behind him could not help but shudder, back half a step, originally thought of the step forward Dorag is not moving, feeling the strength of Yin En. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the soldiers, Dorag, or even Ian, can already imagine Lucien’s reaction to the high-level knight’s imperative oppression, that is Scared and trembling, the voice vaguely begged for mercy, and may even be directly scared to wet pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what Ian, Dorag and the soldiers couldn’t believe was that Lucien was still so serious and calm, and asked: "Don't you? Want to violate the Knights Code now, killing innocents and weak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be completely unaffected by Ian, and Ian, Dorrag faintly, in front of The poor young man seems to have the will of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still need me to repeat what I just said? Do you really want to be expelled by Sir Wien?" Lucien stepped forward and sternly again. Opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian can’t wait for himself to be the villain who ignores his life and his future. Now he can pull out his sword and kill Lucien, but he still wants to be The knight, who wants to be a nobleman, wants to have his own manor. It is definitely not his real thought to abandon these things for one or two sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the choice of murder, there is John, there are many farmers in the wheat field outside, Ian can’t do it at this time, if the face is not up and down, He has already given in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if it's not about John, I will definitely teach you to be polite." Ian took the opportunity to step down and said to Lucien, regardless of whether John was the most annoying and unwilling to wait for his early death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, because I didn’t want to see Lucy’s odious face, Ian went into the manor and went to report to Sir Wien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorag is standing cold with a face, not saying a word with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not care about this, quietly stood by and waited, just before Ian’s momentum was oppressed, before Lucien’s soul was not affected, It doesn't work much, but after the soul is wounded, you can shake his spirit. Fortunately, Lucien has already had a "ice and avenger", but his fingers reach into the pocket and touch, so that his will reaches the first-level knight. The level is much stronger than the original, and Ian’s point of oppression is like a breeze that has been blown up and has no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After less than five minutes, John strode out and left Ian far behind, waiting for him to see Lucien. I couldn't help but be surprised: "Lu Xien is you! Who is out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the road: "Things are urgent, while walking Said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoulder sprinting a distance, in John’s puzzled eyes, Lucien said that he had long thought of a good line: "I am I often met a beggar in a few days. He always inexplicably condemned the nobility and the knight. I also dragged me to the secret corner yesterday and said something about God. He was a believer in the devil and secretly preached in Aalto." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally wanted to go to the church to report him directly, but then I accidentally saw him and the Aaron gang's Jacksonian mysterious contact, I am worried that there is still What plots will endanger Uncle Joel and Eliza, so come directly to you, and if you report it through Sir Wien, the church should pay more attention to it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man who respects the rules of the Cavaliers, John has no doubts about his good friends. He trusts: "The Aaron gangs are actually connected with the devil's followers. It's damn. I will go to Sir Wien immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute, John, I think things may be more serious than you think, the beggars in Aalto City There are only a dozen or so, and where are the rest of the people?” Lucien said something he knew in another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard that so many people were missing, John was more dignified, but strictly obeying the gains of the Cavaliers and the rules, so that he did not panic, but kept a good Calm: "The devil's believers must have taken the poor people to make blood sacrifices. Well, things are very serious. You must tell Sir Wien immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi Grace nodded and reminded me: "John, you must not tell Sir Wien that I found it. I am worried that if the devil believers are not completely destroyed, they will revenge me after they know the truth. It’s just a poor person, I’m afraid there are no knights to stay up all night.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay. Unfortunately, if you can really eliminate the devil’s followers, Lucien can definitely get a lot of Reward." John understands Lucian's concerns, maybe the time to go to annihilate the devil's followers, and even the knights, there are people who are tempted by the devil, if you don't know, then you will know only Limited to himself, he only Pity for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and patted John’s shoulder: "You must also let Sir Wien keep it secret for you, Uncle Joel, Eliza, Ai The texts are all ordinary people, anyway, your reward can be obtained from Sir Wien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t the only way, Lucien Lenvien The jazz are not willing to believe that relying on their own guy who only has a few apprenticeships of magic, go to the church to report, maybe even they have been caught together, although they can find someone to go on their own, such as ignoring children, but one It is not easy to attract attention. Secondly, in the hearts of the church pastors and bishops, there is an impression of such a mysterious person. Maybe there will be big trouble in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, if Sir Wien is a 60-year-old, physically fit, happy family, strict knightly spirit, and a knight who is a consultant to Dagong, If it is tempted by the evil spirits or the devil, then Alto may have become a paradise for evil spirits and demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I will, or Lucien, you think carefully. When the time, Sir Wien’s reward, if I can, I will give a share. You." John nodded cautiously and sacrificed for justice. He was not afraid, but if he would be frustrated with his family and friends, he would be worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
