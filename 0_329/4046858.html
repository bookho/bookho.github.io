			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A legendary strongman has the ability to influence the surrounding environment. When their inner feelings are uncertain, the atmosphere naturally solidifies like the sea before the storm begins. Repressed and low, it seems that an unimaginable storm may erupt at any time and place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark arm of the dark epic knight has a faint, sharp light, as if they are six legendary swords; the octopus The head raised a tentacle, as if the strings of the soul were playing in the air; the middle-aged man like the Necromancer and the vampire had more than a dragon, picked up the dark green eyes, and the forehead, face, and back of the hand were all overgrown. Red scales; eye-devil masters, regardless of big eyes or small eyes, each eye is staring at Lucien...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not they make a big fuss, keep not The legendary strongman’s calmness is really the reputation of the young and seemingly handsome young people in front of them. The number of legendary strongmen killed in just a few years may be comparable to that of most people present. The sum, whether there is no magical legendary undead, manipulating the legendary necromancer of a conspiracy, or the demon king, the epic knight, the legendary magician, are not weak to the slaughter creatures - they will be "half God Lich" Congers Die due to the Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, more importantly, even Lucien? Evans is not the last killer. His appearance is often accompanied by the fall or defeat of legendary powerhouses, such as the Elf Guardian Lan Hill, such as the former demon prince, such as the endless sea lord Helks, such as "Hell. The Lord of Maldives's coming incarnation, these more resounding names than the legendary powers he killed by himself, let the wisdom creatures of the Dark Mountains to be Lucien? Evans calls it "the incarnation of the god of doom" and "disaster demons." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, see Lucien at such an important meeting that may be played at any time? Evans appeared, they are inevitably faster in blood flow, who will be bad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the gaze that can make the Knights of the Sky collapse, Lucien pushes his monocles inconspicuously, even if they are strangers It’s not so obvious to be alert and alert. If you want to oppose an outsider, you can speak out directly. Why do you look at yourself so badly? Do you want to talk cordially in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fythia smiled and said: "Everyone, this is 'Atomic Control', Lucian Evans, just come to the dark mountains to visit old friends, hear We are going to have a crucial meeting, so come and listen to the first-hand information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this attitude of Fitia, present The legendary powerhouses have converged their emotions and did not ask who invited Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician shrouded in a black cloak hoarsely said: "Are you attending the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is only my personal behavior, as a great arcian, I personally represent the will of the parliament." Lucien said ambiguously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the Arcane Master..." The ancient heritage magician seemed to have no interest in the word Arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fitiya chuckles: "Aug, no matter whether you admit it or not, every magician who got the title of the Great Arcane Master has the worst. Standing on the same level as you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient heritage magician is the "King of the Dark Side" Ogg, good at shadows, darkness, curses and illusions When the magic is broken, it is only a legendary second-order magician when the magical empire collapses, so the older Fiatia ridiculed him with rudeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Fythia with a slight surprise, her attitude towards the Arcane seems to be not so repulsive, but before that she clearly expressed her I don’t like it... No wonder she always gives people a sense of contradiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Ogg didn't talk anymore, although he is now on the same level as Fitia, but with more mysterious spells and rituals, it has been transformed. For the vampire of Fitia, he still made him quite afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fythia pointed to a magnificent chair like a black throne: "Mr. Evans, you sit here and listen."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chair is located at the end of the legendary members of the Dark Council, and then is followed by legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the strong people in the dark world regained their gaze and glanced at each other. The air suddenly sounded like a slap in the air, and the tiny electric sparks leaped out as if they were carrying out unmistakable exchanges of thought. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogg implicitly said with anger: "Maybe Dracula and the Magic Council are colluding together, no wonder he is so confident to integrate us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dracula will cooperate with the Magic Council?" The Lord of the Eyes waved a tentacle with small eyes and removed all hateful magic from all members of the Dark Council. In addition to the parliament's Ogg, Dubnaar, and a few Taikoo dragons, Dracula and Danisos are the last to see the Arcanist. After all, they were in the midst of the ancient magical empire, due to their own guilt Always pressed by the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the "Elderly Brain" sound sneer sneerly: "If the interests are sufficient, why can Dracula not cooperate with the Magic Council? If he really Working with the Magic Council, four legendary peaks such as Douglas are hiding in the dark. What do you want to do? Oppose, or agree?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brain is not a true legend. It belongs to the "sponsor" of the "host brain" of the spirit sucking monster. The monster hidden in the deepest part of the dark mountain range will never leave its own nest step, and the strongman who has fought with him is absolutely big. Some of them died or became his slaves. Therefore, even Dracula and Danisos would not easily provoke him. It is not clear to what extent his strength has reached, but he is roughly judged as the legendary third-order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the Dark Council has important things, or when it is the turn of the "main brain" guardian "flamestone valley", he will send a "brain of the elderly" By controlling the mind, soul and body of the man, he will have the legendary strength in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the words of "the brain of the elders" mean the mysterious "main brain", and the legendary strongmen in the room become silent, if the situation Really to this extent, what choices should I make? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, their sensory focus has shifted to Lucien, and seems to want to find clues from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh black short hair, handsome face, deep eyes, full of time-style dressing, the more you look, the more the old monsters like Ogg are unhappy, a company The kid who has no age at all is actually the legendary peak! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Elderly Brain", the eye-devil Lord and other guys who are different in appearance, Ogg and others still maintain the appearance of young and middle-aged people, but the road The vitality of Sean’s soul is unmatched by them, and it clearly shows his years of prosperity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien felt the gathering of mental power field, consciousness field, etc., and showed a smile without hesitation, and gently snorted, it was played "call". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing of this cold and cold sound is so appropriate, with the help of the half-plane mapping reality, the sensation of Ogg et al. suddenly emerged a hot A striking fireball, like the sun directly in front of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sigh of pain, the induction of Ogg and others instantly evacuated Lucien’s body, but they did not become angry and angry, but suddenly realized clearly By the way, this young man is indeed the legendary peak. No matter how young he is, he is also the legendary peak with more strength than himself and so on. One of the most powerful forces in the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they also remembered the legendary spells exposed by Lucien, "advanced time stop", "luxury big crack", "eternal blaze", " Forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow"... These legendary spells are combined. If there is no extraordinary ability or object against the "time stop", even the legendary third-order will be spiked by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary powerhouse on the scene, how many dare to say that they can stop Lu Sien’s attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the mysterious horror of the "main brain", I am afraid that only Ogg is more fortunate because of Lucien? Evans does not seem to have a spell like "the light of judgment" and "the fate of the meteor" that can erase the life of the talisman. Of course, if he takes his wife's "sword of truth", it is another matter. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a small earthquake struck the strongest of the dark world, Lucien quietly waited for the beginning of the memory, waiting for Mr. Rhein to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
