			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to someone else, maybe only guess the approximate "suspect" range, but Benedict III clearly knows that Lucien only has negative emotions and The mystery of the ancient devil, there is no way to steal and use the power of faith, but also secretly develop the steam gods and intend to intercept the power of the "art of the craftsman" Hite, so it is likely to be Lucien Evan And the Northern Church exchanged the methods they owned to achieve mutual compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the mind of the Pope "Vicken" will not determine the judgment. After all, it is not excluded that someone deliberately does this to disturb the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s really you, ‘acting’ is more than all the actors...” Benedict III converged his expression, but his tone was still a bit gnashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you tempted Lucien, he was strictly rejected by his righteous words, saying that this is just an experiment. All he needs is the essence of the essence. I don’t really want to go this way, I’m dismissive of Tanos’s self-created god-like method, and because of his consistently good and determined arcane attitude over the past decade, he actually believes, actually Believe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is necessary to first determine whether the people of Berkovsky have the power of emotion and the power of faith to combine the secrets of the shocking god. ...... If there is, you have to speed up the progress, you must grab before they try to break through the gods..." All the negative emotions of Benedict III disappeared quickly, and the "channel" of inexplicable contact was attributed to the monster Viken, no longer entangled in the road. Sean’s possible “deception” is to think about what is most likely to be done right now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tanos and his own god-like method helped him and him become a god, there are many coincidences and luck in this process. I still can't understand the changes. Therefore, the success rate is much lower than the actual performance. Even if Bilkovsky and others have the divine glory and belief power accumulated from generation to generation, the possibility of successfully promoting the god-like is also terrible, and failure means that either Suffering from heavy losses, don't want to try again in a hundred years, or directly fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the probability is low and cannot be ruled out, so you must first confirm and then change your plan reasonably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing stroking the Platinum Scepter around him. Looking out of the window with a faint look: "...you have to get a list of materials that Lucien Evans exchanged for the last two years, maybe you can find something from it... 'Reporting dead birds', it’s time for you to work. It's not that I am going to marry you and order you, contrary to the premise of cooperation, but it is also related to your future, you understand how to do your best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later. On the desk of Benedict III, there is a list of the materials that Lucien Evans exchanged for the last three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician, you need to carry out endless experiments and refine the applicable items or devices, so this list can be spread hundreds of pages and can be seen at a glance. It made people faint, and there was no way to find anything useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change to be anyone else, I am afraid I can't find your real purpose..." Benedict III's face sinks into the water. Keep looking and constantly drawing circles on certain materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is based on the materials needed by his own method of God to set the list of Sean, one by one, if the situation is small, then the description It’s just a coincidence that if the list contains most of the “French-like materials”, the answer is self-evident – ​​as a legendary magician, Lucien obviously has his own treasure house, has its own material source, not all All need to be exchanged from the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black circle is drawn on white paper. Benedict III's face became more and more gloomy. Until the list of hundreds of pages of materials was finished, he looked at the final blank with a gaze: "This contains eighty-seven kinds of materials needed by the law of God, which takes up the whole Seventy-three percent of the materials required for the method..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he raised his head slightly: "The eighty-seven materials contain emotional power and The power of faith combined with some of the materials needed to attack the ritual of the gods! Is Lucien Evans changing from the other legends to the last step? Or did he research it himself?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other legendary magicians, even Douglas, Benedict III will not speculate, but Lucien himself has been studying the power of faith and the power of emotions for many years. He also opened the "immortal chamber", saw the "secret of immortality", and was good at creating miracles, and proposed a theory that people could not even imagine. Therefore, if it is him, it may be possible to rely on his own research in such a short period of time to complete the "God of the Gods" in his hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of it, he stood up suddenly: "Before the news of the dark mountains, Lucien Evans has completed the state transition, plus material preparation, he may try to shock in the last year or two..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There must be 'reporting dead birds' and other legends that are willing to cooperate to pay close attention to his movements, paying attention to his steam gods..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon of the Ice (December), dripping into ice, the entire Rentamont On a layer of white coat, other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus led the core priests of the steam gods such as Harold and Mirna to pay homage to the silver-white "nuclear bomb artifact" and pay homage to this " The incarnation of the power of the god of steam expresses the gratitude of the past year and the blessing of the new year to the supreme Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They squinted their eyes in the right hand, squatting on the ground, praising the god of steam in their hearts, singing the god of steam, reporting on the propaganda of the Lord in the previous year. The harvest of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the silver "nuclear bomb" glowed softly, and the empty light sprinkled on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trembled a little, feeling a sacred transcendental force that eliminated some of the hidden anxiety inside, and suddenly, the mood was more peaceful and peaceful, and they prayed in unison:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dominate everything, control the boundaries between life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver ray was shot from the "nuclear bomb" and fell to the head of the Archbishop Augustus. Then everything was restored to its original state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus is slowly getting up, solemn and implicitly excited: "The Lord descended the gods and asked us to hold the weekend of the last week of each month in the future." Great worship, and changed some prayers, so that his glory can shine on other dwarves outside of us, save them from the temptation and coercion of the false gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "May your way go to the ground like walking in your country." The other dwarves answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying in Renta, they are inevitably influenced by the Truth, and they incorporate some prayers in their Mechanical Revelation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end of the week, Augustus led the core priests to preach for other dwarves, a darkness suddenly highlighted in the silver "nuclear bomb", one with The bird, which is strongly dead, fell down and carefully examined the residual smell on the "silver-white nuclear bomb." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A big church every month, change the prayers, hey, can't you wait..." The bird made a difficult and quirky voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sound of "Du" and "Du", the bird quietly disappeared, and at this time, a sinful scent came to the extreme but emerged from the air. Circled for a few seconds in the chapel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The recent change in steam godism..." Pope Benedict III There have been several more information about this in the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is expressionless, tapping on the table, and whispering to himself: "It seems that his progress is faster than I expected, already doing the best." Preparation, if it wasn’t for the Northern Church’s flaws, it’s really been smashed by him. When he discovers it later, maybe he is already a god.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Benedict III gently leaned back and leaned back on the back of the chair, asking himself in his heart: "Where do you hide to complete the promotion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking of this, he suddenly snorted: "No matter where you hide, I can find you. Others may not have the means, but as long as you are on the path of faith, then you can't!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know where to take out a beautiful figurine, engraved with a bald dwarf, with a dense pattern on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken closed his eyes, his right hand stroked the statue of the bald dwarf, a little bit of divine light that was hard to see, just like a little angel Surrounding it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
