			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phantom phantom, countless black bats vacated, instantly filled the entire hall so that the knights, wolves can not help but the eyelids are heavy, slow thinking, want to Lie down and have a good night's sleep, and the place where these illusory little bats gather the most is the big knight of the Frost Giant's blood and Sir Duda. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Katrina smashed the door with "The Great Fireball of Lucien", Duda’s body changed, and the burly was about one meter nine. The figure is raised again, the muscles are bulging, and the black scales grow on the skin, lingering with a touch of blood, and the eyes become red, as if they have lost their senses, leaving only the purest killing and destruction desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil bloodline!" Yakov and Anna, among the thick and bloody sacred sacred sacred people, saw this scene with amazement. Wake up a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood surrounding Duda blocked the imaginary sleeping bat, and two scars of deep visible bone were cracked in the back, and a pair of black ones appeared inside. Bat wings. The wings were gently fanned, letting him fly away from the ground, looking down at the hall and the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of the devil, the devil and other blood, even if only the level of the big knight, can fly at low altitude, occupy the air power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through, swaying the thick blood of the fog, and quickly cleaned it up, Anna and Yakov and other mercenaries The mind is clear, it seems that this really wakes up from the nightmare, and feels a strong fear of the killing and hateful feelings that have just filled the heart. If you continue to do so, you will definitely become a demon who kills your companions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Katrina!" Anna exclaimed, because in the middle of the hall, in contrast with Duda, it was the tall Katrina, her foot The void, standing on the top without any ground, the long blond hair fluttering in the wind, and the right hand is holding a staff with a translucent gemstone, which is filled with a thin white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog spreads rapidly and is not affected by the "wind". Looking at this incredible scene, Anna feels that she is still dreaming. She dreams of a powerful mage in the story of the bard. They fly out of nowhere, they manipulate the weather, they Create flames and create cold, they are mysterious and terrifying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale fog spread out, except for the altar where Anna, Yakov and others were located, the rest of the hall was quickly shrouded by this thin fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf and knights who rushed to Katrina stood in the same place, lost their eyes in their eyes, and the sound of the lotus in their mouth, the corner of their mouth Out of control of saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to have lost all their ability to think. Only one body is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the terrible werewolf in his own eyes and the knight who is tempted by the will, just shrouded in thin mist and turned into this idiot, Anna’s head From the scene, I looked at the scene in a little bit: "Katrina is a magician? And it is a powerful magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina is currently The appearance is in full compliance with her imagination of the magician - except that it is not so savage and fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fog of the mind? The mid-level magician Katrina is the horror magician I met that night..." Yakov is a multi-year mercenary I got a lot of magic descriptions from various channels, and after becoming a formal knight, I also got more information from the Earl of Cartart, giving him a new and detailed understanding of the spell, plus he used to The formal magician has worked together, and it is natural to judge the magic through the performance and effect of the spell. Of course, it is limited to the more common ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the blonde in the air, Katrina looked at her and was wrapped in a layer of transparent magic runes, looking at the black fireball played by Sir Dudda. After falling into this layer of runes, there was no violent explosion. Instead, it was absorbed by the runes. Yakov’s head was blank, shocking and frustrating, so that there was no idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big knight of the "Frost Giant" bloody body swells, surrounded by countless snowflakes, a translucent ice cold ring spreads out, will be nearby "Mind of the Mind" Expelled, but at this time, behind him, a figure appeared quietly, black shirt, red jacket, long white hands with long white hair, but with nails shining with cold light. Then, this figure is like a ukulele, reaching out from behind Gently stroke the throat of the "Frost Giant". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Frost Giant" made a painful scream, his throat was bloody, his hands swung back, but he only broke a phantom, Karendia The Viscount appeared in the other direction, extending his right hand to his mouth and gently rubbing it: "The blood tastes good and there are no toxins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This perverted behavior is so elegant and natural that he seems to really taste the host's own food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frost Giant" power horror, good at all kinds of frost spells, but this also has to be hit to be useful, in speed and agility completely beyond the normal level 5 In front of the prince of Karen Deldia of the great knight, he was like a helpless child, how could he not hit each other, and he was caught twice from time to time, hit by dark spells, even the Viscount of Karendia. I also took the time to kill the werewolf who became an "idiot" around him - he really hated that smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the handsome man who can only witness the afterimage and his tyrannical strength, and look at all kinds of strange magic flying above, the radiant Katri Na, the fear and worry in Anna’s heart disappeared without a trace, and she secretly thought: “The magician and the vampire are the forever villain combination in the story of the bard, too worthy, too handsome!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, there is Katrina's sister, or else..."!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She happily patted the chest It is very envious and yearning for the strength and fighting of Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dura is a five-level knight, demon blood, but in front of a well-prepared magician is a bunch of hands, can not play their own strength, once again A magical effect such as spell reduction, Musclein curse, slow technique, etc., is getting closer and closer to the edge of failure, and each time he attacks, he is either affected by illusion or is absorbed by Douglas's spells. Surgery and other magic blocks, no effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't go on like this again..." Because it is only the demon blood, Duda barely retains the ability to think while fighting, seeing his situation Bad, the "Frost Giant" was quickly killed by the vampire, so I began to find a way to get rid of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly relaxed Anna, emotionally complex Yakov and other more unclear mercenaries watched the battle, suddenly, they were shocked to see Duda’s right hand grab On his left arm, he violently tore the entire left arm and then made a deafening roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is he going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The special ability of the devil?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shock, they only saw Duda’s left arm blasting, turning into flesh and blood, the creeping flesh and blood constantly neutralizing the thin fog, let them There is no trace of disappearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog of the mind disappears, the remaining werewolves and knights regain their minds, and some of them use arrows to attack arrows or use spell-like abilities to attack Katrina, and part of them wave their swords Extraordinary weapons such as maces and sticks rushed to Yakoff and others, trying to distract the attention of Katrina and the Viscounts of Karendia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ferocious atmosphere of the werewolf and the mighty will of the knight, the mercenaries shivered and did not even have the strength to hold the weapon, and the sound of the jingle sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov regained a little knight’s power in the innocent control of Duda, holding the long sword in front, whispering the horrified Anna Wait: "Don't be nervous, I will block them. If you support for a few seconds, Katrina will end the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, I will help You." Anna disregarded her strength and her legs trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a cone of crystal light in her sight, as if it were all composed of ice, and a few werewolves in the place where the light swept And the knight turned into an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good..." Anna whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov has a similar feeling, but his rich experience makes him not squat, flea out<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hit the ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
