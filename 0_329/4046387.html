			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand and solemn voice, the dreamy and magical city, let the dwarves fall into deep shock, what they see in the eyes, what they hear in their ears, are the first encounters in their lives. Even though I imagined, I never thought about such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of high-rise buildings of hundreds of meters make them feel shorter and shorter; the stars are like lights, making the city look vast and vast; all kinds of magical things, exquisite The complexity is far better than the steam civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a city, facing the dreamy things, Harold and other dwarves have their own standing in the innocent starry sky, being set off by the humble little a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the awe of the splendid civilization when they first heard the steam civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power from civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying for a long time, the elders woke up, their hearts trembled, and they fell to the ground, regardless of the hotness of the yellow sand, swearing:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great god of steam, your country is the residence of the gods, your country is the ultimate steam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elders’ prayers call back the soul, and Harold and other dwarves face the city that seems to be the embodiment of the Kingdom of God, and pray:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your gift The vastness is like the sea, your majesty is as heavy as the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred and solemn voice rings again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Not a fellow, you must not show my name to the person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders took a moment and reacted quickly, with Mirana et al. The dwarf meets: "Not a fellow, do not tell the holy name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if the voice from the sky continues:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where you turn away from me, Will be swallowed up by the steam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf who has been prepared will answer: "Whoever renounces the glory of the Lord will be swallowed up by the steam."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice becomes ethereal and ethereal:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For my servant, for my Dai, no longer for others Slave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs sing: "There will be no glory for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several consecutive questions and answers, the voice in the sky gradually disappeared. Suddenly, Harold saw the city in front of him expand and turned into countless bubbles to rush to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the "bubbles", the strange vehicles made of steel became bigger and more transparent, showing the complex and intricate structure inside. The core machine, which is different from the steam engine, composed of pistons and bearings, and various mysterious and mysterious patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "bubble", the steel geek bird also became thick and transparent, exposing the neat rows of seats inside, and the precision machinery covered by steel The pipeline was exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the "bubbles", the approximate structure of many buildings such as high-rise buildings, factories, chimneys, roads and bridges emerged a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Dizzy, dizzy, and the dwarves such as Harold and Quikins have a feeling of exploding, which is complicated and incomprehensible. Can't understand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bubble into a group of light points into their arms, all the waves in front of the waves, began to fragment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you want to get, and the rest is to be searched for with strength, courage, perseverance and senselessness." The loud voice seems to sound. Every dwarf ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders don’t forget to lead the dwarves to pray:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Respect your holy name Practice your path and you will set up your country on the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it took, they slowly woke up, opened their eyes and found themselves in a cave that was both familiar and unfamiliar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" The elders stared blankly at the altar that seemed a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold groaned, looking strangely at the thick books in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just learned the dwarf text for two years with the elders, and the complicated words on the cover are difficult to recognize:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Primary Mechanical Forging". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, the god of steam really came!" Harold blurted out and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other dwarves also found the books in their hands, and were shocked by Harold’s uncontrollable sound, and then burst into tears, for the dark and desperate life. The first dawn appeared and wept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, their "memory" has returned to their minds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self waiting for the dwarf rebel army Occasionally, this steam civilization was discovered to worship the caves of the gods, so it was used as a hiding place and restored to the worship of the gods. Today, Harold accidentally makes the vampire Tess, Galata, etc. On, they have killed many compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of desperation, the altar suddenly lights up, and the gods descend, and Tess and others are instantly purified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the "God" directed himself and others into an underground palace, a palace with dwarf murals, and when he opened the palace gate, he saw a place. Yellow sand desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a difficult trek, I have eaten countless bitterness, and I have finally seen the magical unimaginable city in the oasis deep in the desert-" Atlantis", the god of steam! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elder Augustus who felt very confused in his memory sighed: "The original underground palace, murals, desert, oasis, and Atlantis are great. The god of steam makes the sight of our souls, not the real things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chaotic situation, most people who know magic They will doubt that their memory has been passive, but they have just gone through the "miracle" and opened their hearts, but they take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, an illusion magic tube doesn't work, it just doesn't work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like the curse of the eye, Atlante wrote in a paper: “Only to find the mind hole, even if you don’t use illusion, you can make people Produce false memories!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, great elders, that is the real thing, but only in the steam heaven!" Dwarf Rebels battle leader Quinkins loudly The objection, "One day, we must let the Lord's way go to the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold recalls "Atlantis" and suddenly becomes Silly and dumb: "I always thought that the steam giant with many mechanical products is the most ambitious and most shocking city. I can't think of it. I can't think of it, there will be a city of Atlantis that is beyond the imagination of miracles! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every piece of machinery in it, every detail is so magical, it is simply that the steam invention has developed to the most extreme appearance, no, it has finished It completely surpassed the steam civilization." A dwarf said like a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, the rest of the dwarves who worship the ancient steam civilization will certainly ridicule him mercilessly, satirize him, curse him, and even slap him. But now, almost all the dwarves can't help but quietly nod, not only because it is the god of steam, but also because of what others have witnessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dream city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold’s expression became excited and his fists clenched: “Atlantis, Atlantis, my goal is to build a ground Atlantis, can have half of its magic, no, one third is OK!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beautiful light 'Xinghe', I I can never forget.” Melna said as if she was a nightmare. “Unfortunately, I could not see the structure of the 'mega metal arrow'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the memory of other structures is vague..." Harold was a bit frustrated, but he quickly cheered up. "We have to lay the groundwork first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He raised the books in his hand and then puzzledly saw a piece of parchment in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdrawing parchment, he found it to be a contract that stipulated a contract that promised everything in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great god of steam descends the gods, let us follow the principle of 'equivalent exchange', which is an important creed of the steam and machinery kingdom." Feeling the hint of the gods, excited and excited, then he did not hesitate to sign the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save yourself and others, the god of steam with the city of miracles "Atlantis", Harold and others have no doubt at all, follow the big The elders signed the contract. And for them, the most important thing is the last one of the contract: "In the near future, the devout dwarves will be reborn and will leave the night plateau and stay away from the slavery of the vampire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The light flashed, the contract came into effect, and Lucien, who was invisible outside the crypt, nodded lightly and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the illusion, it took a lot of work, so I didn’t alarm anyone to transfer them to the underground caves discovered by this “secret eye” and then messed up. Their memory order and fabricated a little guided false memory to avoid the problem of not having enough ability to weave real memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if they are convinced of this memory, waiting for a while, it’s hard to tell the truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Yellow Sand Desert and Atlantis, is the simulation of the five-ring illusion "mirage" that Lucien used to display the blood of Aphrodite. The specific blueprint is some big cities on the earth. As for the fuzzy details of mechanical structure, it is doped with many magic symbols. Even if it is discovered by legendary magicians in the future, it is considered to be the ultimate in the popularization of magical alchemy products. future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the underground cave, Lucien’s face gradually became dignified, because from the description of the “open heart” of the dwarves, the two vampires who died were nearby. The wife and housekeeper of the lord Vlad, especially the dwarf vampire, is the most favored bride of Count Vlad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ordinary vampire disappeared and disappeared, but the disappearance of these two vampires will surely cause Vlad to leave the anger and trace it to the end. The connection, with his familiarity with the territory and the keen sense of high-order vampires, he is sure to discover where the underground palace is located and find space nodes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Things must be dealt with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien walked to the castle where Count Vlad was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The next day, when the constellation changed and the morning came, the dwarfs began to work under the whip of several other supervisors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisors did not care about the failure of the wife and the housekeeper overnight. The "deputy steward" had already explained it. They found the trace of the dwarf rebel army. It’s normal to spend two or three days on similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement in the dark castle, surrounded by layers of dark law, is set with a bloody coffin, and there is a strong black air from time to time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where the vampire Count Vlad is sleeping and is the core of the control of the entire castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vlad is in a deep sleep, he will completely open the magic array and traps around the basement, so as not to be sneaked into by the vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Vlad, the defense of his castle’s core took thousands of years to lay, even if the vampire marquis and the duke arrived, to break open without disturbing him. The law, there is absolutely no possibility, if forced attack, at least the Duke's level of power can be broken after a long time, called a model of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in comparison, the attack power of this core defensive array is quite inadequate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The means of contact with the Count of Vlad in the basement is in the hands of Mrs. Tess, the Galata butler and two other vampire brides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
