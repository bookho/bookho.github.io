			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the triumph of the Rantat triumph, at the beginning of the Hua Deng, the warm wind of Hunchun came at night, still with a little coolness, so that the pedestrians couldn’t help but tighten tightly. Neckline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey pressed his own black top hat, came down from the bright yellow public transport, strolled on the bright, white streets, near the Arc de Triomphe The "knowledge bookstore" went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this week's "Arcane and Magical Herald" coming?" Downey asked the boss with a beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss with dark yellow hair doesn’t lift his eyes: “No, no more.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it..." Donnie was not surprised, as if he had expected a slight sigh, and the rich sentimental emotions permeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss raised his head and looked at him like an owl-like eye: "What's the pity? Since the magical live screen became popular for home TV, Heidi Ms.’s artificial intelligence has made a breakthrough, and the newspapers that have problems in positioning themselves will sooner or later announce the suspension.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his weird pupil, it reflects A handsome boy, about sixteen or seven years old, is the age of Fenghua Zhengmao, but his blue eyes are a little exhausted, and his expression is slightly depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie smiled and said: "I grew up watching the "Arcane and Magical Herald", it led me to the arcane of the pursuit of the essence of the world. Road, for me, it is a wonderful memory, a life that will never be forgotten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic radio, the popularity of home TV, The initial civilization of artificial intelligence has enabled the public to have more channels of information sources, and their dependence on newspapers has been greatly reduced. Especially the basic knowledge of arcane has been popularized so far, many ordinary people are interested in deeper and higher-end arcane theory. Less, because it seems that this has nothing to do with your own life, anyway, the general understanding can be obtained from mainstream newspapers, radios and home TVs. The number of newspapers that specialize in arcane and magic is high in Arcane and Magic Guide. The magnitude is decreasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And magic apprentices and arcans are not likely to buy it. They have more professional academic journals and have an impression of Allinge that suits their tastes. 》. There are real channels in the world, so three years ago, that is, the beginning of the 21st year of the Arcane calendar, newspapers often have the phenomenon of suspension and closure. I don’t think it’s a big name today. It is also the "Arcane and Magic Guide" that symbolizes the golden age of the arcane realm and the initial establishment of the magical society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bookstore owner pointed to the row of bookshelves: "If you want to learn basic arcane, there are a lot of professional books here, if you want to know the latest trend of arcane research. You can subscribe to the "Alinhe Impression", or watch the "World Reality" TV station's arcane popular programs every day, there is really no need to read the "Arcane and Magic Guide"."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bright magic crystal lamp, the rows of dark or dark blue spines are full of fascinating brilliance, and Downey’s dizziness, the forehead blue veins beating slightly: “No need, My own books are still not in control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he took the public transportation bus to the Triumphal Square was because the school had been unable to buy the Olympics some time ago. "Art and Magic Guide", and "Knowledge Bookstore". But who knows, this is less than a month, the "Arcane and Magic Guide" can not support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss smiled and glanced at the magic apprentice and trainee of the Downey long black dress chest, and a black bottom, light green Outline the coat of arms of the seven-leaf leaves: "You are a fifth-grade student of the 'Nature Heart' school? Now there are only sixty-one days left in the Unified Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools. What else to buy for "Arcane and Magic Guide" ", reviewing with your heart is what you should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools", Downey's facial muscles could not help After a twitching, I looked a little stunned and a little annoyed. Some repression: "Today is the weekend, it is only 8 o'clock to have a night course..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously explained a sentence, then laughed at himself, I gave What does he say about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than two decades of development, under the leadership of the Magic Council, the entire continent has formed a general education for citizens - primary magic school, various alchemy schools, Other professional schools - a three-level school system such as the Higher School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Primary Magic School is also a five-year course that completes the real magic and arcane basic education, trains qualified magic apprentices and trainee arcans, and finally selects talents to enter the major magic schools through the “Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools”. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unified entrance exam, there will be a certain amount of extra points for the official magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey just wants to turn around and listen to the bookstore owner laughing: "I see that there are only three school badges on you, no other magic items, family conditions. It should be bad, or use more snacks for review."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a school system, various magical items that restore fatigue, keep a clear mind, and enhance memory And the pharmacy is favored by many students, and it is rare to wear a "wake necklace" or an "energy ring". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these accessories and pharmacies are not available in the true unified entrance exam, they are extremely helpful in the efficiency of normal study, so no one will refuse. Unless you can't afford it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s face was pale, then he was red, and he was ashamed and annoyed. He turned to escape the bookstore that made him jealous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a 'clear necklace' here, you can rent it for two months..." The boss didn't have an emotional voice into Donnie's ear and let him I paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned sharply and looked at the boss and said, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was excitement and suspicion in his tone, and the corner of his eye fell on the bookshelf, looking at the "Identification of Various Fraudulent Magic Contracts" - Lucien Evans, secretly speculating, is it true? To pay for the soul yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss laughed and said: "I am also a loyal reader of "Arcane and Magic Herald", otherwise it is impossible to go to the end to buy, so, see you, I am like seeing myself in the past... How, I am afraid that I have another purpose? You can take the contract to the appraisal department of the City Hall for identification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, What do I have to pay for?” Downey relaxed a little and asked eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss thought for a moment: "The deposit of ten copper coins, and the unified entrance exam is completed. Come to me for two months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey heard such conditions and nodded in a hurry: "Well, no problem! Sir, when is the contract signed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A "wake necklace" is worth about two to five Queen's gold coins, and can be rented at such a cheap price. Downey is naturally excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The necklace is not on me. Come over this time tomorrow." The boss sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tangni even thanked the channel, seeing the time is not early, leaving the bookstore. Going to the public transportation platform, all the minds are the "fantasy" and the "high school of magic school uniform entrance examination" that is about to arrive in sixty-one days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When waiting for the arrival of the public transport, Downey’s eyes turned to the Arc de Triomphe, where a brass-colored statue stood in a double-breasted dress. Wearing a top hat, a cane in the left hand and a pocket watch in the right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Lord Evans..." Downey muttered to himself, with a cult in his tone. There is a little "hate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty-sixth public transport vehicle, the destination of thousands of lakes..." A mechanically cold female voice, a dark red public transport vehicle Stopped in front of Downey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is sober from his thoughts, quickly walks onto the bus and places his school badge in the sensor area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rentatt Seventh Magic School, the remaining eight free rides..." The mechanical voice rang again. There is no human emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heart of Nature is the magic school of the Magic Council, the Elf King Court, and the Holm Empire. It is the seventh elementary school of magic in Renttat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really convenient to have artificial intelligence..." Downey thought subconsciously. "Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to see the combination of artificial intelligence and alchemy life that Ms. Heidi said... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
