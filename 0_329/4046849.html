			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-white lines illuminate one by one, relying on the real time and space to form and form, Lu Xien’s “time and space” layers are stacked one step at a time, stepping into the “gate” Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of light, dazzling, the shadows gradually faded, and when everything subsided, Natasha’s eyes were left with a little silver-gray empty magic array. And the pale and pale "gate of time and space." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the 'University Observatory, the transmission is about to begin, please make sure you have the medicine in your hand." Lei Yiya's crisp voice in Ali, Anderson, Jane and Philomena echoed in the ears of the four students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali looked at the light blue test tube in his hand. The spicy taste of the drug still seems to remain in the mouth. However, after taking the medicine, he did feel it. A kind of refreshing that is difficult to describe, just like the soul, the brain, and the body are all packed into the magic refrigerator. Before he saw Jane first stood up, he hurriedly followed, but fortunately, he was lucky, and finally ranked fourth, not waiting for the next batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned over, he and Jane looked at each other and saw that the black eyes lost their usual silence, as if two flames were burning, excited, excited The longing for emotions can be clearly sensed without any discrimination. This is the true desire of human beings living on the ground for the vast sky and the innocent universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps not in the sky once, you will never understand what is called small, what is truly vast and tolerant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around in a circle, the expressions of these students are in the eye, and Lei Yili smiled slightly. In the heart, the council is really willing, everyone is With a tube of "Strong Chilga", we are usually reluctant to exchange, preferring to endure the dizziness caused by space transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chilga" is a fruit of the Holm Kingdom, extremely rare, and can be used as a main material to refine nearly high-end medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lei Yi Li Ya is also very clear. The generosity of the parliament is purposeful. When the students really "see" the stars, they feel the vastness of the universe. Broad, you will understand that the "God of Truth" who competes for resources and believers on this small planet is not as great as they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, through their communication, pre-formed similar views among young people and children who received school education, in line with the "Starry Sky Museum" and "Cosmos" of the Parliament Follow-up measures such as “Experience” and “Introduction to the Starry Sky Program” were promoted to the entire Straits and North Coastal Corridor, maximizing the public’s vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention, the transmission array starts." Lei Yiya began to inspire the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali’s inner nervousness. He didn’t even experience the flight. He actually jumped on the “enjoyment” space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time nervous, the uncontrollable expectation and yearning made him unable to stand shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strip of silver shines in Ali's eyes, making him feel very bright around, but can be vague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel, who is looking for Samantha with the "Arcane" journal, is both excited and frustrated. These two very different emotions make her own I felt that my forehead was swollen and I had to reach out and say: "There is really a positron..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case that I have not personally verified it, Can't really say it." Samantha's expression is equally complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she said this, she still believes that Lucien really found positrons, not to mention the absolute in the microscopic field after the Lucien equation was promoted. The important position, the perfect harmony with many experiments, and the arcane masters have to believe that the negative solution of this equation does represent anti-particles. It is Lu Xien’s consistently strict arcane attitude and does not fully grasp the precedent of not publishing papers. · Let her not doubt that positrons can indeed be found in cosmic rays, which may be the power of authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This world is so wonderful - no, in the past tens of millions of years, no intelligent creature realized that there is antimatter. With arcane In-depth, 'the real world, will be presented step by step in front of us.” Rachel's eyes are full of yearning, including excitement, this exploration of the mysteries of the world is the most essential and most attractive charm of the arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha nodded. "In fact, from the perspective of symmetry, anti-particles seem to be a very normal thing. If there are particles, there must be anti-particles conjugated with it. Especially Evans also abandoned the most. The concept of negative energy states questioned by the paired appearance and annihilation of positive and negative particles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I don't know the gang's negative energy vacuum The sea, admire the mood of the guys who are now. Even the arcane masters who think they should support this conjecture model have given up on this concept." Rachel laughed, though the picture of "negative energy vacuum sea" Let every magician feel excited, there seems to be a direction to explain the essence of magic, but all the arcane masters who have studied in depth in the microscopic field are cautious and not optimistic after the excitement, because the spin is Experiments with partial particles of integers are not optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha has a rare smile: "No matter what, for the time being, it is impossible to falsify, and Lord Evans's constant undulating energy in the vacuum, the same can not Confirmed·······”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, her story becomes complicated and a bit confused: “The uncertainty principle is really the source of! One?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, decide where the location is, whether it has been swept into the garbage of history? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald Evans provided a way to verify the uncertainty principle behind the paper..." Rachel’s voice suddenly looked a little ethereal, "according to field theory and not Determine the principle, there are tiny electromagnetic fluctuations in the vacuum, which can be confirmed by designing appropriate experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha looked at the paper on the table, a word Can not tell, Lucien's past "great record" shows that he is definitely not a dreamer, not an arcane master who made an experimental idea without any confidence, since he clearly put forward a way to verify the uncertainty principle, then explain He has a great grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the uncertainty principle is proposed, although the current micro-field experiments are very harmonious with it, it has not directly proved its experiment. This makes the star system The Arcanists can adapt slowly and are not "destroyed" by the huge and direct impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have this experimental idea and prove it in the early two years, I am afraid that only the low-level magician can live alive." Rachel also has a bad Premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha sighed softly. After two or three years of blows, he seems to have begun to accept the demise of the end and collapse, believing other stars The same is true for the Arcans, the world is so cold and will not change because of its own unacceptability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up at the window, and the bright sunshine made her slightly narrow her eyes, as if she saw a bright and sad future: "No matter what. The discovery of anti-particles is a memorable page in the history of arcane. We have taken the original scope and are more realistically close to the essence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perhaps very long In a period of time, there will be no more important and deeper discoveries than it.” Rachel also looks at the blue sky and dazzling sunlight outside. “From the current research progress, after the previous decade’s After the leap of development, the arcane seems to usher in a bottleneck period. Breakthrough theories and discoveries still take time to brew."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through layers Time and space, Lu Xien once again had the feeling of "reunion", and there was a faintly overlapping area in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling light faded. Ali felt uncomfortable, but the cool feeling made him not faint, and couldn’t wait to see the surroundings for the first time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to pay attention to the cold and mysterious magical array and alchemy device. There is no righteous or dedicated to the Arcane division salute, but directly Beyond the transparent "glass". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unimaginable darkness, unable to see the deep sighs at the end, the vastness of the sky feels hitting Ali’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark white light inlaid in the darkness is clear and clear. There is no flickering. It seems that they will always hang there, and they will remain unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously looking to the feet, it is also the boundless darkness and pure thorny stars, which makes Ali, Anderson and Jane inexplicably feel that they are small and thin, lonely Loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
