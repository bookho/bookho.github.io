Downey stunned and stunned, but after the sound drifted out, it seemed to melt into the air, not arousing a little The surrounding area is still quiet and solid, with tombstones and monotonous black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones looked at him with fear and then looked at Carl, didn’t you say don't worry? Why do we still have the same nightmare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling, this encounter, they are very familiar, no difference from the previous nightmare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl looked at it for a while, and then Wen Wen smiled: "It’s just a nightmare. What are you worried about?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice does not know what magic is used, it directly rang in the hearts of Downey and others, and his quiet and soft face, silver and purple radiance, like two beautiful stars, not only Without a trace of fear, it is full of curiosity and exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler School of Magic, Dean Tower, Lock Control Center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A water screen-like live screen is showing the scenes in every corner of the college, and the light and shadow are changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several water curtains present a bedroom from all directions and angles, with the name "Life Tower 202" on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night, this bedroom is as quiet as other places, without any abnormality, in the soft light of the street lights, showing a chic cold . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe stood in front of the water curtain, his hands in the black long trench coat pocket, staring blankly at the water curtains, they not only show Out of the picture, and there are nearby sounds, and different fluctuations are sensed. Make people immersive, such as on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the 202 bedroom is still quiet and silent, no abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Felipe suddenly sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you worry? Unconsciously in the lock Manipulating the dream, who knows what will happen next!" In the "dream", Downey seems to be a bit difficult to contain his emotions, because he sensed the call of the distance, the heartbeat is getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami was a little scared, a little scared, and looked at Karl with a bit of confusion: "Does your brother not say that you don't have to worry about this thing? But why are we still? Going into the same nightmare? I thought I really didn't have to worry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind him regained his spirit. It is stretching "four limbs" with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you really let go of your heart? Jones whispered a slap in Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kar has waved his hand: "My brother said don't worry. Then don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He has a very confident look, but the expressions of Downey, Sami and Jones are not the same thing, who knows your brother! Who knows that his guarantee tube doesn't work! Anyway, it is a fact that we are entering the same nightmare again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl blinked and didn't explain why he believed his brother. Instead, he smiled and said: "Actually. In a few nightmares. We have not been physically harmed? Isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount... Downey Lived, it is true, a few nightmares. Although it is very realistic and scary, but every time it quits the dream under the gaze of the "original body", it has not been harmed by itself. Not only that, it seems that the growth of mental power has also accelerated greatly than before, and "dreaming" is still Is there such a benefit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the nightmare of the front is not hurt does not mean that we are not harmed this time." Jones tried to hide his sense of existence, fearing that it would suddenly come out in the darkness. A powerful undead creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Carl nodded if he had something to do, and his smile was weird. "But we have entered a dream. Why don't you explore it and find out why? If you are in danger, if you are manipulated, how can you?" If you don't encounter danger, you will not be hurt anyway, and it is our dream. We believe that we are strong and strong."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie, Sami, and Jones are all stunned. Think carefully, Carl’s words are very reasonable, because they all feel that the call in the distance is getting stronger and stronger, even if they don’t take the initiative, I’m afraid Being attracted to the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, they vaguely felt that Karl’s words were a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But before that, try to get out of the dream!" Fat Jones gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, out of dreams? Downey and Sami are all looking at Jones. They are both academics. They have no adventures and can't guess Jones's plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones raised his left hand and put it to his mouth, then bit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of screaming in the hearts of the people did not break the condensate of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down his left hand and look at the teeth printed on the bloodshot, Jones laughed at the surprised Downey and Sami. "I heard that pain can help." People are out of dreams, but now it seems that the people who manipulate our dreams are very powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, this is a special 'dreamland'..." Carl He whispered aloud, then smiled and said: "Ordinary pain is definitely not good, or, Jones, you directly hit the tombstone with your head, maybe after fainting, you can get rid of the dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones looked at the hard black tombstone with a bitter color, and wrote the ancient magic language in pale white: "He thought he would not die, but he did die." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, certainly useless." Jones measured the hardness of his head and tombstone, quietly shrunk to the side, let the "talent" permeate, and strive to make I am not being watched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl snorted: "So we set out to go to the central tomb?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good! Downey didn't hesitate this time because he couldn't control his body, so it's better to take the time and explore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Downey made the decision, Sami would naturally not object, and to be honest, he has not figured out the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since no one objected, under the leadership of Carl, a group of four walked toward the central tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint black mist shrouded the cemetery, the sky was still gray and bleak, and the huge tomb was like a black monster. Quietly lying there, its door is half open, like the mouth of a monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallowing a sip, Downey suppressed the fear, as Carl walked into the "monster's mouth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just entered the martyrdom, they met the "familiar" team mummies, but this time, with the "experience" they are no longer confused, but Slightly sideways. Avoid the route that the mummies traveled. In order to make any changes in the situation, we can respond in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray cloth was soaked with oil, the eyes fluttered with the white flame, and the mummies quietly passed by Donnie and others. Perhaps they also exude a rotten stench. But at this time, Carl and Downey could not smell it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough. They can't see us," Downey whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind Sami stretched his body: "Last time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last In the nightmare, he is in the state of ghost possession, and he feels the least. Can only be heard by Downey et al. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the same as the last time." Carl seemed to think of something, more and more excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the huge tomb, the faint black fog is like a solid, and there is no movement around it, like a eternal silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, in the black mist, a little ripple occurs, and a figure condenses out of thin air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a black long trench coat, his hands in his pockets, his nose and thin lips, his face full of sickness, and he was previously watching the water curtain at the lock control center. Felipe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually entered the "dream" of Carl and Downey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, a sullen Felipe nodded slightly and nodded. In the black and white gray monotony, the pace was not slow. The ground walked toward the gate of the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he stopped and looked sharply at the tombstone, cold and indifferent:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tombstone, there is a illusion of ripples, which condenses a figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a black double-breasted long dress and a high top hat. He is tall, but not thin, black and black, with a deep outline. The eyebrows are thick and slanting into the horns. It is a masculine and beautiful man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here too." Felipe didn't seem surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man smiled lazily: "I can find me directly, Mr. Felipe, you are really unexpected."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe turned his head and continued to walk toward the door of the tomb. He asked indifferently: "I can enter 'here', thanks to the special features of the lock. Help, why can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a child of the gods and legends, I always have a unique ability." The man is also leisurely paying for it. Behind Lippe, heading to the tomb door, but listening to Felipe, his answer has no information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe pushed the burial chamber and walked in like a king inspecting his territory: "You didn't ask someone to help, not afraid of danger?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man laughed and didn't feel nervous. He seemed to be playing in the land of thousands of lakes: "As a child of the gods and legends, I am always a bit unique. Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same discourse has different meanings, Felipe no longer speaks and goes deep into the martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the main tomb door, the dark enamel is present In the eyes of Downey, Carl and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to the "peaceful coexistence" with many powerful undead creatures did not let their tensions fade away, all of them looked nervously and nervously, fearing the horrible inside. The first body will suddenly turn over and sit up, use it to represent the eyes of death, expel themselves and others from the dream, and even directly deprive life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in their hearts, more or less have the idea of ​​using the "original body" to escape the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint breath of death began to flow, and there was a dark abyss under the darkness, which seemed to hide something that was hard to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the squeaking of the squeaking sound in the scorpion seems to be more than the "original body" that Downey and others imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie, Sami, and Jones have a strong desire in their hearts, and the abyss is calling them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prevented them from controlling themselves and grabbed the abyss "proficiently" before the lid was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl stunned, then bit his teeth, touched a piece of jewelry on the chest, and then stepped into the abyss.
