			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Gray Fog is not far from the fork, even if the road is rugged, the carriage is bumpy, and the night is gradually darker after an hour. I saw the town where the two streets were intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you travel to the foggy town, the more you get into the deep forests, the variety of trees begins to change, and the common banyan and birch trees are rapidly decreasing. The gray-black color is similar to the trees of the Melzer Black Forest cedar tree, and their roots, branches and other knots bulge out, as if the lively black monster makes the little girl Betty can't help but hold tight. Bow, a little closer to the carriage, Mr. Evans has the strength of a high-ranking knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilfried Tree of Devils..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien through the car window I have identified such trees. They have no special place except for the shape. But because Wilfrid, the necromancer who left countless horror legends, liked the tree and planted it extensively in his semi-plane magic tower, the tree was named Wilfrid. Magic tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s surrounded by this gray-black magic tree, the town looks far like a cloud of fog, it has the present first name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage drove into the town and drove past a group of lumberjacks who came home in the evening. Lucien saw that their expressions were numb and their eyes were sluggish and seemed to have been The hard work and life of a slap in the face wipe out all passion and vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my future life is like this, then I would rather choose to die." Betty squinted and looked at the lumberjack, and motivated herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hotel door in the town, the carriage has just stopped, Wise, who had been silent for a while, jumped down and squatted on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Wise’s musical talent and the good communication during the rest of the day, Betty asked in the past: “Mr. Wise, don’t worry? I know this. Duan Lu is really bumpy, or else you will follow us on foot tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I feel much better." Wise's physical fitness is not bad, retching After that, his face gradually recovered, and the smile responded to Betty's kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna, while helping Lina, who was also a little dizzy and holding her baby, walked down the carriage and smiled at Lucien: "Mr. Evans has a good face. Not as fragile as I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just kept sleeping." Lucien didn't pay attention to bumps all the way, focusing on parsing and learning magic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing by her, Joanna’s voice screamed softly in Lucien’s ear: “Thank you Evans, you didn’t blame me for that fool. Sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave a slight glimpse and then smiled: "She has tried her best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Simon on the side is also whispering: "Mr. Evans has a good strength. If you don't yell at Betty, we don't know that you killed Chris."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, laughing two times, Lucien replied humorously: "Poor Betty." They estimated that they were ready to go home before they summed up the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina walked to Lucien with her sleeping baby and handed Lucien a Silverar: "Mr. Evans, thank you for letting me join Team, I have arrived at the destination, this is my reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just on the way." Lucien took over Yinnar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not beautiful Lina smiled: "No matter what, your kindness will be remembered. I am going to find my cousin, Mrs. Callin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Lord bless you all the best." Lucien used the idioms of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shadow of the second floor hotel, Lina looked slightly gloomy. She smiled and walked to the other side of the town with her baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone bridge in the distance, behind the stone bridge is a tall black castle, cross arches, spires and heavy and solemn architectural styles are all exposed It was built in the late Twilight War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna sighed slightly: "Unfortunately, Baron Habero has not been able to advance to the Grand Cavaliers. The body began to decline in his 60s. In recent years, after the small Harbero went out to try to stimulate blood, he rarely went out. Concentrate on operating the territory and enjoying the music in the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hero always goes old." Wise, who came over, said with emotion, "Besides the Lord, the world Who else can be immortal? Maybe music can always be full of vitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty originally wanted to interject, and Wise was so sighed by this literary art, and the emotion immediately became heavy. It seems that it is meaningless to struggle for the whole life to stimulate the blood, because it will eventually be in the arms of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not so emotional, because the magician as long as he can enter the high-level threshold, life expectancy will be beyond imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mrs. Karin is the wife of Mr. Cook, the steward of Baron Habero, and I don’t think Mrs. Lina has such a prominent relative." Joanna See Wise, Betty's low mood, and quickly shift the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the aristocratic steward's wife, in the eyes of Simon, Joanna and others, is considered a big man, especially the aristocrat is still a real knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Into the hotel, the thin-skinned boss looked up with gray eyes and looked at Lucien and others: "Several respected guests, what do you need?" If you are staying, please register your name and birth period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a flat tone with little enthusiasm and is disappointing to the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Blanca, we have lived here a few months ago. You don’t look too good?" Joanna asked strangely, only then She and Simon, Betty took the money and hid in the city of Kather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanca stunned and said to himself: "Small Roy is dead, he was called when he was only ten years old."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many months?" Joanna turned back to Lucien. "Little Roy is the youngest son of Mrs. Blanca."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise crossed the cross on his chest: "I am unfortunate, may he live forever in the Lord's kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding Bran Mrs. Card’s status, Joanna was the first to register, she wondered: “Mrs. Blanca, isn’t it possible to register a name? Why is it still a birth period?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This kind of town hotel basically does not verify identity documents, but the registration period was born in Joanna that I have never heard of. Even Lu Xien, who has traveled a lot of countries and is not very knowledgeable, feels strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanca’s gray-white eyes replied in a sluggish manner: “This is the order of the Baron, I don’t know why...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth period is not confidential information, as long as the identity document can be seen, but the Baron Haberro specifically emphasized but let Lucien have an inexplicable feeling, if it is their own life to see The story of ghosts and fairy tales, the specific seasons often mean the requirements of sacrifices, sacrifices, etc., but the magical road of the world is no stranger to the world, at least the book "The Book of Astrology and Elements" has not mentioned birth. What does the flood season have to do with magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siimon and others are puzzled, but they don’t care about the birth period. Anyway, this kind of adventurer can’t just check it, so they dictate , recorded by Blanca with his own unique symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Simon you are only twenty-nine years old, I thought you were thirty-four and five years old." Lucien joked and said that Simon’s face is indeed old. Joanna is twenty-seven, Betty is sixteen, and Wise is twenty-two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simon smiled and replied: "When I was 20 years old and married Joanna, the guests thought I was her father..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien was amused, and then learned that Wise only reported his surname: "Evans, Holy Calendar June 26, 798."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucien is silent, is his oysters counted as June 26, or is it through that day, or last life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
