			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dimly lit candlelight shines through the silver magic lampshade, and the whole house shines brightly. Annick, Reyia and Heidi are all on paper. I continued to calculate and analyze the practice title left by Lucien, "The elemental equation behind the apprenticeship of acid splashing and its structural graphics." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This carefully selected magic allows them to keep in mind some of the elemental symbols, proficient in the theorem of magical geometry, mastering computational methods and mapping elemental equations to structural graphics. principle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three four-year-old children are all concerned with the expression of concern, with a touch of tiredness on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, knocking on the door, Annick sat up straight, as if awakened from a dream and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliyah and Heidi were half a beat slower than him before putting down the quill, a little worried and fearful: "Is Mr. Evans coming back? Will there be a magical analysis question? Or will the magic be released in the magic practice room like in the afternoon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lucien is the morning guide and Do a set of exercises, let them repeat in the afternoon, resume consumption, then restore and then release the practice magic release to shorten the casting time and learn more about the basics of arcane through the application, at night it is to comment and explain the daytime exercises, and need to be good The magic analysis problem that I worked hard to understand in a few nights, let the three teenagers listen to Lucien, the footsteps of the official magician who is not much bigger than them. There is a feeling of scalp tingling, exhaustion, and depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the magic of learning and exerting difficulties in the past is released in their own hands, they have a strong sense of accomplishment and happy satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick shook his head: "Mr. Evans will push the door directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I heard Annick’s affirmation, Lei Yi Li Ya and Heidi both patted the chest: “Fortunately, it’s not Mr. Evans.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who. Hey, it seems that the night has come completely, how do I feel that I have just used dinner and saw the red clouds like the evening.” Annick shook his head and felt that after a few days of hard work, he always felt confused. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Annick was surprised to see Sprint and Katrina, who stood in the door and ignored themselves, slightly proud. They With outstanding talent and rapid growth, he has become a leader in the apprenticeship: "Sprint, Katrina, do you have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Whether you want to admit it or not, seeing Sprint and Katrina explain the basics of arcane to other juvenile apprentices, Annick has an envious mood when they see their natural, fast and smooth release of magic. They don't need to do this kind of hard work like themselves and Heidi, and there are reasons to be proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint heard Annick’s question, a small, well-defined face with a surprised expression, and couldn’t help but laugh: "Annick, are you doing a dizzy question? Today is when we set off for the parliament headquarters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, has it been the seventh day?" Heidi just jumped to the door and heard the news. His expression was shocked. Then he tapped his finger and counted it: "A set of exercises, two sets of exercises... Hey, it’s really time to start, I completely forgot. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lei Yi Li Ya was a little pale because of exhaustion, she looked at the night scene outside the window, the crisp sound was already low because of the curse throughout the afternoon. : "Is it seven days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina’s proud face with a little sympathy: "Annick, Heidi, Reyia, you Look at what you look like! Mr. Evans is just getting in touch with the arcane, the guidance is wrong, you have to ask it, you can't let him try Torture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you close the door every day to do those repetitive, simple exercises, so what is the use?!" Sprint slightly raised his head "I see your arcane foundation is still very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Liya shook his head and said: "I find it useful. If you say seven days ago I still can't find the door to the arcane, and now I have touched the edge of the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi also put up a lively, small face and solemnly said: "In the magic practice room these days, you have not seen the progress of our release of magic? This is all the reason why Mr. Evans taught well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After expressing the support for Mr. Evans, the three teenagers silently said one sentence:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If the practice can be a little less, then it's perfect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint snorted: "Magic display of course requires a lot of repetition and practice In this respect, Mr. Evans is indeed an authority, but I don’t mean it.” He wanted to say something, but he opened his mouth and swallowed it back: “Forget it, you continue to suffer, remember to go to the study hall at ten. Collection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina glanced at the back of Sprint and turned away, following: "Remember the ten o'clock, study hall. It is said that we have arrived at the parliament. Will be arranged into the magic school system to learn the basics of arcane and magic, you are now delayed, nothing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don’t they want to believe us? I really feel that there is a lot of progress. I have a headache before reading!" Heidi grievously looked at the other two and felt Sprint, they are so difficult to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya also screamed: "Although I also feel that we are very tired and poor, but our progress on the basis of arcaneism is really obvious. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it doesn't matter, as long as we keep improving, they will always believe." Annick comforted them, but he said with a face Down, "Our magic analysis has not been completed yet. Today is the deadline set by Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyia and Heidi immediately Without grievances, resentment and eagerness simultaneously said: "Let me defeat it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............They are once again immersed in the magical world until The shoulders were photographed before they reawakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans." Annick turned to see Lucan Junwen's gentle but let himself have a face that couldn't tell fear. "I'm still a little bit worse." I can figure it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this name that makes him revered and scared, Lei Yi Li Ya and Heidi quickly stood up: "Mr. Evans, I There is still a lot of difference..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien got the "Brook Thoughts" and was in a good mood: "It is very good to be able to do this. Tonight we are going to leave, then postpone the time until tomorrow night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Heidi almost got up, she and Lei Yili Ya is happy to be together: "It is so good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Annick, a relatively quiet teenager, couldn’t help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly reflected on himself and smiled: "I still have half an hour until ten o'clock, let's talk. You tell me honestly, practice. Isn't it too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Lucien looked at them and returned to his room experiment "Brook's Thoughts". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meditation is to use the mental power as a wave to quench and vibrate, to seek a special frequency, so it has nothing to do with the meditation environment, can be integrated into other meditations. And it also provides different ways of blending ideas for different factions, so there is no conflict with the idea and elemental ideas that Lucien currently uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the experiment, Lucien found that the effect was indeed obvious, ten times that of the previous ancient meditation idea, so that he could reach the second ring magic in more than a month. The minimum requirements of the soul and spirit of the teacher are close to the results of the past year. I have to feel in my heart that in this world, magic is not as old as it is stronger, but it has developed significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lu Xi’an’s question, Lei Yi Liya’s face was red and red: “Mr. Evans is actually okay, there is not so much practice, I certainly can't grasp the basics of arcane so firmly." Then she wore the black rounded sneakers and rubbed her feet on the ground, and her face became more blushing. "But it can be a little less..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, although very hard, I think it is worth it!" Annick boldly replied that these seven days of improvement can obviously be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien laughed and laughed: "At present, it is to help you lay the foundation, let you accept the idea of ​​arcane, and then reduce it appropriately." At the beginning, my class teacher also lie to me... but it will definitely reduce some because here. Theory can be directly linked to practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the three teenagers happy and shyly bowing, Lucien continued: "In fact, when you become a formal magician, you will discover the current learning arcane." The foundation is so simple and easy, so clear and easy to understand, I think the calculus and magic construction principles should be deeply hated by many magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is it so difficult?” Heidi asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. But this is not too difficult, I have a hunch, with the rapid development of arcane and magic, the future knowledge will become more and more difficult. Maybe a hundred or two years later, the magician below the high level probably won't touch, but if the magician above the high level wants to be promoted, he may need to learn the various kinds of terror... change...not...analysis...on And deep into the micro level, the macro level of all kinds of things beyond imagination." Lucien sighed with ambiguity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of Reyaliya is also evoked: "Mr. Evans, how hard do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably it will be difficult for those high-ranking magicians to want to cross the time and space, and the guys who created this knowledge will be killed one by one." Lucien answered half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brush, Annick and the sweat on the faces of the two little girls came out, then he whispered: "May be the future high-level magician can't wait In the people who are killed, will there be Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible existence of the high-level magician, just like Astar Sir, will they be forced to this extent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably, maybe, hope." Lucian looked at them with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick asked subconsciously and weakly: "Mr. Evans, can my current age and body be able to turn away from the Knights..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyia and Heidi are similar expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Annick’s thin body, Lucien shook his head and said humorously: “You still continue the magician’s promising career. The path of the magician is loneliness, loneliness, and hardship. Oh, no, it is full of glory, wealth, and worship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Significantly joking words, instead attracting three The young boy nodded in agreement: "Yeah, we have heard that the official magician adults are powerful and wealthy. In the Kingdom of Holm and other kingdoms, they are sought after by ordinary people. It is one of the best choices for marriage... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, well, let’s go to the study hall, it’s almost ten o'clock.” Lucien understands that the status of this world magician is very good. As long as there is no suppression of the church. Because they directly master the extraordinary power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the dark and quiet night, two canoees glided through the canal and headed for the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the pier, the boat did not stop, continued to go out into the sea, until the darkness highlighted a three-masted sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom’s dignified on Lucien’s road: “Mr. Evans, you may have a bit of trouble on this trip. Because of the relationship between the betrayer, we The route that broke through the blockade line has been discovered, and now only the standby plan can be activated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What backup plan, how is the church blocked?" Lucien Nature To understand in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom simply explained: "The church is using precious, only dozens of magical airships to take turns patrolling in the air to discover unidentified ships; The sea has long been raided and inspected by the fleet belonging to the Knights of the Helmets; the seabed is responsible for some of the stalking fishermen who changed their faith. Originally we bought several fishermen patrol captains and relied on the ability of the magical sailboat to dive briefly to break through the blockade. However, after Brown’s betrayal, the fishermen’s partners have already been on fire.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The amphibious three-dimensional blockade of the sea, land and air...fortunately, there is no radar ..." Lucien subconsciously associates, "What about now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
