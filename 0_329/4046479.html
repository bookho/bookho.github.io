The fireworks were exhausted, Fernando said with a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled, and the whole person seemed to be a lot older: "After Brooke relied on electromagnetic theory and wave theory to become a great Arcanist, I felt Alti Something was wrong. At first, he thought that he was depressed and hateful, so that his family name was distorted. Later, he found that he often exaggerated the problem, and all the problems that could not be explored and could not be solved were attributed to the roots of the original, the things that we have not found yet. I started to be a bit skeptical, and I found some traces later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here, he sighed softly: "But he seems to be aware of it too. What, I quickly found my remorse, saying that I want to use the power of the church to deal with Brooke, not the god of truth, and the more trust the church trusts him, the easier it is for us to deal with them at a critical moment. I think he followed me. For more than a hundred years, I grew up a little from the 13-year-old child. I know his name and thoughts, so he didn’t directly attack his mind, but chose I believe it for a while and use other methods to test it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the electronic discovery, artificial planet and other events, his performance and cooperation are quite good, I will relax Be wary, coupled with his consistent disdain and resentment about volatility, things in recent years are reasonable, people can't doubt, can't think of..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only then that Norman and Luciana had come back. Altil was the undercover of the church, and he was swallowed up by the Holy Light instead of exploding his head? He will be magic instead of magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cognitive world, unless it is projected into the main material world to form a semi-position, we have no way to check whether there is a trace of creation." Fernando's expression is very serious, In his view, although the magician is closer to the real progress, the faster it is, but in this respect, it cannot be compared with the clergy. Their strength comes from their beliefs. If there is a problem in the faith, it will lose power and even be sanctified. There is no way to send undercover, even if there is, it is a type that is not high level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was thoughtfully nodding his head and integrating the light of faith into his cognitive world. Alti尓 could not use his magic. But it seems to be a small half of the clergy, so after the trust of the god of truth is shaken, the light in the cognitive world erupts with the collapse, and he swallows his head before it bursts, and the faith of the past is true. The gods who smashed their heads just formed a sharp contrast, presumably because of whether the parts related to the gods in their respective cognitive worlds are dominant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this logic, Thrad, the pope and saints of the Northern Church, the truth of the sects they met, seems to have some Traces can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you only keep faith in the God of Truth, no matter how they change, how to change the doctrine and cognition, you can use the magic, will not be The light is swallowed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salder, after the event of the Necromancer, the sect of the Truth, is not so religious to the God of Truth..." Lucifer I wondered about my chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, I initially suspected Arthur, but after he knew that Evans’ miracle experiment was all right, he dispelled doubts." Manman later said, "He has two friends who are committees, which can indirectly affect many things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old qualification is high The magician, even if the surname is worse, there are many friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I asked Vicente to examine the two committee members," Douglas said concisely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is interested in analyzing the composition of Altil’s cognitive world: “It’s okay to know that the miracle experiment is okay, probably because he has not witnessed it, and With psychological preparation, I know that this experiment only shows the possibility of naturally producing the source of life. It can neither completely negate the creationism nor follow the guidance of the theory, and can not find the path from the source of life to the real life, but the new alchemy The technique gives a complete and true theoretical system. As long as the neutron discovers that from this theoretical system, it will always find ideas and create new magic to control the authority of creation, so he can't accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, in his cognitive world, the god of truth should be at the root of all things, the status of the original Creator." Fernando said the conclusion, then turned to Douglas, "originally It is to ask you how to use the new alchemy to attack the church. I can't think of a church spy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando's bright red eyes are a horrible storm: "You haven't tested him? You should know the contact code and technique, seize this opportunity, and give the church a big hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that it is difficult to do new alchemy without verification. I am looking for Atlante to come and plan the steps to create the best hints and atmosphere." Douglas slightly decapitated and gestured to Norman and Rucinana for the time being. Can't leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Royal Magic Tower, the element will be in the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi received a thick paper and a thin piece of information to review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New alchemy? Lucien? Evans?" The first time I saw the subject of the paper, the simple and general Lavin frowned slightly, but He knew that Lucien was a rigorous person. This must have his purpose, so he didn't entangle the problem too much. He turned the paper and continued reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements and alchemists are not separated. The Holm Crown Award represents the highest honor in both the elemental and alchemy fields, so the Arcane Review Committee of the Elemental Will, Four are the authorities in the field of alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This look, Lavin is trapped in, his eyebrows are slightly shaking, his hands are a little bit tremble like a real old man, showing his inner shock and excitement. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he whispered slightly out of control: "This is the deep mystery of matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight became a bit fuzzy, and Lavin’s eyes seemed to have a white-haired old man who was wearing a robes and lying on the bed. The ritual that turned into a lich failed, and his soul was close to collapse. It is extremely serious and fanatical: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raven, do you know the meaning of the word alchemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He represents our magician's dream of controlling material changes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Replace me, continue on this path!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven closed his eyes and whispered to himself: "Teacher, have you seen it? New Alchemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in this atmosphere, Lavin was only recovering for a long time. When I opened the information, I frowned. "Altil is the spy of the church? After seeing the new alchemy, the faith is shaken. Was swallowed up by the Holy Light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked at the following, he called the students waiting outside: "Check who is related to Arthur Close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" His students did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven repeatedly and solemnly repeated the content of the information, and then said: "Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." His student just turned around and seemed to think about what he asked. "Teacher, can this content be revealed? Or is it a secret review?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be revealed that this information requires less authority." Lavin thought of the embarrassment behind the intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the student went out, he got up and went to the lab to prepare for the proton discovery process before he could write the assessment results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Ravendi has always been a serious and serious arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One half-face, another member of the alchemy field, Prado respectfully Standing at the desk waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired man behind the desk who doesn’t look old, always with a smirk seems to be in a dream, even a blond little girl looks like The doll came in with a cup and did not open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Klaus sighed: "I finally saw this day alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The world is wonderful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the new alchemy that can go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Light Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filibel just finished the prayer, I felt a red cardinal rushed in, it seems quite flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal, Archangel Intelligence!" Philip Bell rebuked the Cardinal for not being able to breathe, and he heard this amazing news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel long? Douglas was promoted? Do they really master the authority of a certain god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many doubts rose in the heart of Philipbel, but no matter what, the important surname of the archangel’s representative is self-evident, so he took the thick The information of the book, told the cardinal to go to Shi Dong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the angel is long...and it comes from Arthur...with important material materials, with a curse..." Philippe Bell saw the cover After the sentence, I checked it carefully and found that in the small pocket attached to the information, I ran a weak curse, and I became more and more trustful in this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Filibel, what angel's long-term intelligence?" Bahá'u'lláh was in the Glorious Cathedral, disappeared through the connection of the divine array, and then It soon appeared in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filliebel saw the presence of two legends, witnessed, and then opened the information cover and read the thick paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baha'u'llah, who was dizzy when he saw the complicated magic and arcane symbols above, simply regained his gaze and waited for Feile Bell to sum up, and his heart raised a little doubt. Why do you want to send the entire paper instead of refining the focus? Is the entire document a long-term angel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading read, Philippe Bell trembled fiercely, his eyes filled with anger, skipping the part of the quantum structure, outer electrons and alchemy, Look directly at the places of greatest concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... From the material of the surname, I found a trace of new elements that perfectly conformed to the radioactive nucleus I described and decayed into new elements. Phenomenon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a line of black words: "Refer to the attached important material."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippe Bell untied the black pocket attached and saw a group of ore with a lot of magic marks inside. It was marked in red as a whole, with black, white and green, if there were no rays flying out, a little red It turned into blue and turned into a green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traces are magnified by magic, and magical fluctuations are masked by curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This material is not fake, but is marked by magic to show the whole process in a demo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a kind of element that decays into a new element..." Feili Bell seems to have magic, continue to look at the paper:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...From the beginning of human learning magic, the dream of refining other elements into gold has never been cut off. This is not only our desire for wealth, but also the reality of the world. Yearning, I want to grasp the mystery of material change in our hands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, for thousands of years, no alchemy reaction can make substances At the fundamental level, there is no need for a constant magical array to continue the change... We humans seem to stop at the door of the material mystery and stop before the so-called god restricted area..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the former proton neutron electronic structure, thought of Lucien's description of the decay process, Philippe Bell seems to know what it is like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, starting from the internal structure of the atom, starting from the essence of decay, we can find the way to truly change matter and create new elements! According to my theory, Although the cost and results may not be proportional, it means that we have really stepped into the forbidden zone of the gods, and have touched the mystery of matter, and will complete the dreams of countless generations of magicians!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
