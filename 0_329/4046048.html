			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over the formulas listed in this article and the meanings of the formula symbols in the final appendix of the Arcane Journal, Lucien analyzed these formulas. I found that they are basically consistent with the celestial mechanics formula that I know. That is to say, the results calculated by them, as long as the magician does not have calculation errors, should be more accurate, but in that accurate position, the existence of the planet cannot be found. ! Seen on the mainland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s plausible." Lucien once again uttered a sigh that he had had before, and then browsed the article to see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Lucien turned this article to the first page and wanted to see who the author of the article was: "Oliver? Constantine, Great Austria." The master, the legendary magic profession 'the hand of annihilation' three levels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be a great arcian, but also a legendary magician!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien once again raised the astonishment of emotion: "Look at the position of the arrangement, the honor of the Arcanist in the magical world should be above the legendary magician, and both can be simultaneously Existence, should be a different evaluation system, grace, one is the classification of strength improvement, one is probably from the contribution to the study of magic principles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this idea, Lucien quickly flipped over and looked at the signatures of those articles. It really was: "Eight Arcane Artists, Nine Rings Astrology", "Six Arcans, Eight Rings Element Master" "This way, I’m sure Lucine’s guess, and there’s basically no arcane level above the magic level. It seems to be above this. Promotion is even more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the magical level of the nine, eight, and seven rings for a while, Lucien looked at the following articles, they have: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Study on the vibration problem of certain magical strings";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Differential method, or about infinity A brief description of the series;;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A solution to the Seven Bridges Problem";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derivation of several issues that should be noted when electricity and magnetism are transformed into each other in magic;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A new element measured by the new method";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eternal question: whether the mental power exists in the form of waves or particles" - Experimental research done with "Spiritual Storm" magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seriously turned the performance of the journal to let Smyr Magic apprentices such as Sage and Morningstar secretly nodded. This may be a formal magician. When I first got the journal, I waited for someone like Smyr to say that every word knows, but When they are connected together, they don't know each other, and the hanged person and the mercury are still in doubt. After all, they don't understand and try to see it. It is also this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took half an hour to browse through it, and Lucien had a certain amount of knowledge in it:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From these formulas, the degree of arcane in this world, just three or four hundred years, in mathematics and physics, I am afraid that it has reached the level of the earth in the mid-18th century, calculus is initially established, curved surface, The study of geometrical problems such as spherical surface has advanced by leaps and bounds, mechanics and electromagnetics have become more perfect, and because of the strange development of the world, many things are applied first and then researched, so some aspects of magic are beyond the extent of earth science and technology, such as space jumping. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elemental magic, that is, the degree of chemistry research, has already reached the level of the early 19th century, determining that geothermal feng shui is not an element, and the standard of elements And began the preliminary determination of the atomic weight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the results of research more than 20 years ago, even today, even because of many similar "planet existence" issues Troubles that hindered them The development should generally have the level of the early 19th century, and the chemistry may reach the middle level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the journal of Arcane, Lucy It’s easier to look at it. If you want to link the theory of arcane research with the use of magic, you need to learn slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing the "Arcane" journal, Lucien laughed at the magic apprentices who all came over suddenly: "I have read it roughly, and many of the things inside are very interesting. I can put this journal in me for two weeks. "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, Mr. Professor, as long as you can answer my question." The sage made an old voice, "Because this "Arcane" Journals belong to everyone, and you are coming for the first time, so this guidance is not a private paper-and-pencil guide, but a direct communication, so that everyone can hear it, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still want to test my knowledge level, huh, huh, in this world, I am a rare freak, see how you judge." Lucien answered with a weird voice, "Of course, the sage You can start asking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage took a large stack of papers filled with words and numbers from a wooden box that he carried with him, and let Lucy En turned the "Arcane" journal to the first article: "Mr. Professor, you said that you are good at elements. Astrology magic, and I just have a question about the changes in the astrology want to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I got this "Arcane" journal, I was on the first The formulas of an article are fascinating. They seem to perfectly explain the various trajectory changes on the astrological map, but I am only a magic apprentice, and I get the inheritance of ancient magic. For these formulas, and the above theory, Can you tell me, how do they measure the trajectory of the stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question seems to have been discussed in this magic apprentice circle for a long time, got everyone The attention, the eyes all condensed, quiet and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard what he asked about the celestial mechanics, and said with a funny voice: "You have a lot of questions, I only answer one, that is, about these formulas. Do you want to listen to the meaning and basic principles of the respective representatives?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Professor." The sage did not expect this to know whether the official magician The mysterious man actually could guide, so he did not hesitate to answer, and Smyr, the hanged, etc. all nodded in the same place. After all, in the first article, the words "legendary magic career" were deeply attracted. Their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the feather pen on the table and pointed to a symbol in the formula: "This is the sign of the gravitational constant, and gravity is the formula." The underlying principle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is gravity? When you jump up, the power that falls off without flying magic is the power of Apple's mature natural fall. Things are not specified by God. They are never (read-force) concepts, but they are relative. Only when they are stressed, they move in a certain direction. When you see these phenomena, you should think more about them. Why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien speaks the formula shallowly, and the Sage, Morning Star, Smyr, etc. are confused and ask why, from time to time, they are all Lucien directly replied: "These are the basic problems of the magic principle. If you need to make it clear to you, you must have many preconditions, assumptions, and related knowledge. If you want to start from the beginning, it is not a matter of hours, but a few years. For more than a decade, now, you know that you can use the conclusion. Don't ask too much, wait until you become a formal magician and come back to study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien himself is still in a lot of things to know the conclusion, not clear The degree of derivation process, proof process, even the knowledge of junior high school and high school, need to slowly learn the literature and papers in the library to make up for it, so when talking about the above words, Lucian is silently saying: "Real The reason is, I don't understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Lucien let the sages feel incomprehensible: "The world of magic is really profound and contains the world. The truth of existence and operation, I used to think that I had some research on magic. Today, I heard your guidance and explanation from Professor, and found that I didn’t even touch the door.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey, hanged, Smyr and others all nod, although the mysterious "professor" only briefly explained the application of the problem, involving the rules, theorems, etc., but gave the conclusion, no Why is it like this, but it is Meaning represented by the formula, the law of motion of the planet, and how application of the formula, let them harvest is very large, in some parsing and construction of magic and magic, just think about it now, you think it will be a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the broad application of all the formulas involved in the article "Discussion on the Fifth Failure of Finding the Planet", Sage Suddenly silenced completely, then violently picked up the quill, trembled on the paper, and did not care about the things next to it, as if completely immersed in the world of arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
