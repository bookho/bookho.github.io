			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of the life (March), the weather gradually got rid of the cold, and the caravans, vehicles and travelers to Aalto began to increase again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you step into the last week of March, it seems that everyone from all the countries around has come to Aalto, the big city that stands in the western part of the mainland. It’s crowded and warm, because after a few more days, the “Aalto Music Festival”, a three-day Continental Music Festival, will be held. Countless musicians, musicians, bards, and musicians and merchants who like music are on the way. Arrived at Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus it was originally the adventurer and mercenary in the last big city before entering the Dark Mountains, so Aalto broke out of unprecedented life during this time. And vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the afternoon, the gates of Nolan District are still congested, and the pink-haired girl Lilith reluctantly pulls her brother Sarah slowly along with The crowd went into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, where are you looking? Concentrate on walking!" Lilith squinted at Sarah, but she was used to the surname without loud, seemingly afraid of causing others. note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16-year-old Lilith is lively and beautiful, but it seems to always have a faint melancholy temperament, which has made her a lot of boys in her hometown. There is even a son of a small aristocrat who wants to give up the title for her and does not marry the same bloody aristocracy. Sarah tried to stretch her neck and her face was excited. "Lilith, look, it is the moon elf! How exquisite, how beautiful looks." Ah! The ears are really shaking like the legend, so cute!” He pointed to a few beautiful elf girls who were not far from the city and said to their sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith has a curiosity, squatting hard to look over there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver-moon-like skin, exquisite and beautiful face, the neck contains a few secrets of the beautiful "神", long fingers, slightly shaking the tip The ears, let these moon elves exude a strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no more beautiful than me." Lilith followed the ground and muttered, and then she screwed a Sara, "Brother, Put away the heart of your satyr, pay attention to your behavior, here is Aalto, the city of 'God pays attention'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of "God's concern With "two words," Lilith subconsciously lowered her voice and watched the crowd around her with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color-colored pink Sarah is similar to her sister in four or five points. She seems to be slightly surnamed. He regretfully regained his gaze and saw that he had already entered the city and was busy pulling it. My sister walked in a remote corner: "Lilith, relax, do you think it is so low-key, are you so relaxed and relaxed, and more likely to cause doubts in the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But we are after all... after all, it is a magic apprentice." Lilith looked left and right, and the words of the magic apprentice were vaguely pronounced in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar spread his hand: "What about that? Aalto no one knows. We will leave after we ask a scholar for a few questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not participate in the Aalto Music Festival, brother?" Lilith was disappointed. Sarah showed his brother's majesty and shook his head: "Look at the results of the interpretation. If time is tight, we must leave immediately. Lilith, three years." After that, I can participate in the music festival, and if we can become a formal magician, maybe there is only one chance in this life! Don't let the surname, we will be mysterious and powerful magician."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word magician is only expressed in terms of mouth shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand that the Alto Music Festival is held every three years." Growing up in a repressed, horrible life that will be captured by the church at any time. Lilith understands that she does not have the qualifications and rights to be a surname. "We will be noble and mysterious magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Copper Crown Tavern, Adventure The mercenaries and the mercenaries spoke loudly and spoke from time to time. Occasionally, two of them looked at each other and they would meet the physic or financial problems in the corners of the back door of the pub and the second floor rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't you have a cup?" The dwarf is as usual and has drunk himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the urge to kill all the damn men behind with magic, Lilith nodded to Yan, probably knowing the rules of the pub: "Give us Two glasses of ale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇 欢 cheered up: "Hey, the dwarf 寇恩 likes you such a cool little girl, I personally invite you to a glass of ale. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three cups of foam, the scent of oatmeal was quickly placed in front of Sarah and Lilith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After paying the copper nal, Sarah took a sip of the wine glass: "very good ale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the dwarfs don't sell wine that they don't like." Yan's confused eyes flashed for a short time, "Do you have anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Dwarf, we came from a small town near Aalto. Some time ago, I got an ancient document, and I wanted to find a scholar to interpret the contents." Lilith vaguely talked about her brother and sister. The intention is, "Can you introduce a few scholars to us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩 has a wine cellar: "Ancient literature, whether it is a magical empire or a universal What is written in the language? Or Elvish, Dwarf, Dragon, Abyss, Hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The manuscript we obtained is not the original document. Has been translated into a lingua franca." Sara and her sister looked at each other and gently nodded and said, "Because there is no front and rear The literature, we can't understand the manuscript at all, so we want to find a scholar to interpret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇寇呵呵呵笑笑了: "This document is probably involved A treasure? "When you have been the owner of the adventurer's pub for so many years, he has seen a lot of similar things. Some people have become rich, bought a manor, and some have disappeared forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't know, because we don't understand at all." Lilith concealed the key points and tried to squeeze out an honest smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu En poured his own ale: "I can live to the present because I never ask the secrets of the guests. Your literature is to be read by scholars. It can only be a historian. Aalto’s well-known historian is Baker, Alfonso...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Which do you think is the best?” Lilith cautiously asked, "Which is the most appropriate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇an exaggeratedly shook the golden long beard tied into a scorpion: "One is not suitable Because they are nobles! Only nobles and pastors are proficient in ancient languages, able to read historical documents, and know a lot of hidden things. Your manuscript is in front of them, and it is very likely to be seen."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really no suitable scholar?" Lilith and Sarah were disappointed, but admitted that Yann was right, holding such an ancient document to In front of the nobility, it is indeed easy to be suspected, and once suspected, facing powerful churches and aristocratic officials, I am afraid that my brothers and sisters with backgrounds will be forcibly arrested and interrogated. “Is there a historian who is not a nobleman?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of historian has no access to many hidden documents. The vigilance against the magician and the cult is not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu En shook his head again: "It’s not a nobleman, it’s not possible to be a historian. Wait..." He suddenly remembered something, "I know one A scholar from the poor, he is also a 'historian'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which gentleman?" Lilith asked with anticipation, Sarah The same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇 得 proudly said: "This scholar is Lucien Evans, a talented musician and a 'historian'."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr. Mr. Evans writing "Piano for Silvia" in the first movement of the first major movement in the G major serenade?" Lilith's mouth has become a circle Shape, the expression on the face is very complicated, there are surprises, there are fanatics, there is surprise, there is no way to believe, "He is also a historian?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara The expression is not much better than my sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
