			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with a dry face sighed with a sigh of relief: "I know his teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Old gentleman, are you the legendary magician of the ancient magical empire?" Lucien is not too surprised. After the death of the three ancient magical empire, there are many remaining legendary magicians. After all, they have mastered many The strongest of the magical spells, some of them hide in the depths of the dark mountains, while others hide in the "night of the night" and other areas like the "ice of the snow" and other regions, the choices are not the same, so on the nine floors It’s not too strange to meet a legendary magician in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the teacher of the Speaker of the House fell in the Battle of Antietre during the Twilight War, and he was clearly the strongman of the ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is thin and thin, like a mummy without a bandage, slightly sighs and said: "We, the ancient magician, can’t keep up with the times, look at Douglas. It took me a long time to become a legendary peak, far more than me, what do you do to hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I plan to explore the ancient ruins in the depths of hell. By the way, go to Silent Hell to find a special star nucleus hidden by the former Frost Duke." Lucien is not concealed. Since the legendary magician is in hell, he is likely to know something. "Yes, old gentleman. I don't know what to call you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien recalls the recorded ancient legendary magician, trying to confirm the identity of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am now an old guy who died in hell, what do you want to do with the name and title?" The old man touched his head and had a white hair. With it drifting away, "the ancient relics in the depths of hell? The predecessor of the Frost Duke hiding the star nucleus? Young people, you should be the legendary magician who was recently promoted by the Magic Council? I advise you not to be too risky."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been to ancient ruins twice, and I have almost lost in it twice, becoming a shadow forever wandering, and the empire is more than a legendary legend to explore there. Six of them, the basics of safe entry and exit are the Lord Tanos, Douglas, their legendary peak, which is not counted as the 'Hell Lord' possible shot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the star nucleus hidden by the former Frost Duke, it was a matter of a thousand or two years ago. I suspect that it has already been taken away, otherwise the Frost Duke will not have no clue."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly listened to the old man’s remarks, and I have been comparing the ancient hell materials obtained from the Speaker of the House of Lords and Mr. Rhein. The hearts of the ancient legendary magicians are more or less gloomy and mysterious because of various cruel experiments and strange magic. Few people are as embarrassed as the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think I am?" The old man smiled. "Where can I talk to you young people, I want to die, even if I die, But after staying in hell for 30 years, she stayed with her quietly for 30 years, and people became soft and compassionate. Otherwise, the special soul of Maman has long been my experimental product." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty years? She?" Lucien did not respond positively, but instead asked the old man with great interest, and asked the intelligence to get closer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkled face of the old man became soft: "Since you come to hell, it is better to go to my 'Soulland' pub, just in the ' Silent Hell'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Lucien smiled and nodded, and he had to go to "silent hell" anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is no longer talking, and Lucien is also leisurely watching the majestic steel buildings surrounding the burning flames and flames,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for a while, Maman ran back happily: "Grandpa, 'Water Spirit Wine' has been sent to the old place, they can be sent to the 'soul park' today." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, go home." The old man touched Maman's head lovingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed them, along the Styx, through the first few layers of hell, all the way to the snowy plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plains, the wind is cold, it seems to be able to tear the soul directly into pieces, but there is no sound, plus the ice plains are wide, the snowflakes are flying, walking There is no other soul or devil at all, so an eternal feeling of silence arises spontaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold winds of tranquility, tranquility, and death revolved around Lucien and the old man, but they were bounced off by inexplicable power. Even Maman did not freeze in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, there was a small town in front of it, surrounded by ice crystals, and inside it was a row of “warmstones”. Houses - This is a special product of "Silent Hell", which can effectively resist the cold of freezing the soul and the cold wind that tears the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main material world, because the things are rare, a normal-quality warm blood stone is equal to fifty Jintales, and here you can use Come to build a small town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of the town are wandering souls, male and female, old and young, the body is translucent, they are similar to Maman, have The normal IQ is just the strange feeling of the warm sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old guy, you can come back, I am waiting for the flame wine." A brave man with a goatee floated over and looked at it. The storage bag carried by Maman and the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In "Silent Hell", the soul can also enjoy the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed and said: "You drunk, next time you are frozen because of drunk, I will not take responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the old man eccentrically, and was called the old guy by the ordinary soul, but he didn’t mind at all. The legendary magician did not seem to pay attention to the strictness of the ancient magical empire. Up and down are humble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man talked to the soul while carrying the storage bag to the tavern in the middle of the town, Maman trailed a few steps, curiously watching Lucy En: "Sir, are you not human? How have I never seen a human like you, a warm body, and a devil-like muscle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Human? What kind of human being?" Lucien asked with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maman’s face is slightly transparent, his chin is raised, and the child is proud to say: “I am human.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who told you?" Lucien probably guessed who it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maman eyes wide open with doubts: "Of course grandfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Grandpa, He was frustrated and seemed to find the object of the revelation: "My grandfather never let me temper with the uncles, just let me do meditation that is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your grandfather is a very powerful person, listening to him will not be wrong." Lucien smiled and patted his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come? Uncle and we all say that Grandpa is just an ordinary old man. There is no power except for cooking and making wine." Maman seriously The ground refuted the words of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, a special soul has a legendary magician grandfather who hides his identity. It’s like a bard story. Lucien thinks with a funny smile. Too lazy to explain to Maman, followed the old man into the "Soul Paradise" pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the pub is different from the main material world, while in the bar stands a female soul with a vague and dull face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am back, this time I bought a hundred bottles of water soul wine..." The old man walked into the bar and slammed the female soul. Although he only talked about the daily "acquisition account", his expression was soft and satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the female soul is still in a dull state, mechanically wiping the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said for a long time, it took a long time to turn around and look at Lucien sitting in front of the bar and said: "This is my wife, I want to come. Bottle of flame wine?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and curiously asked: “How did you find it?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the souls entering hell can't recognize their original identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She died because of one of my mistakes, so I can prepare in advance and mark the soul with special methods." The old man opened a bottle of flame wine himself. I immediately poured a bite on myself. "But even if I have a deeper grasp of the soul, I can’t understand its essence, its transformation, so she will only find her better than the ordinary soul. Maybe it will be another hundred years. Completely dissipated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
