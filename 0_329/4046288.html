			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the morning, a high-class hotel in Nolan District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sent Leo to go to the next room to rest early, and told him if he heard any movements tonight, don’t be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meeting Natasha, Lucien believed in the identity and status of her Violet Countess, as long as she did not deliberately hide, It is sure to find yourself easily in the city of Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a glass of red wine in his hand, Lucien sat on the sofa in a leisurely manner, but did not drink it, just shake it gently, from the bright red swaying Recall the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Bern" wine from the Felice House, which can only be tasted at the banquets and dances held at her home, but this The hotel is inextricably linked to the Haien family, so it gets a few bottles as a gimmick for some wealthy businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哐哐哐, the crisp and rhythmic knocking on the window came, Lucine smiled back and saw Nata, who had changed into a lilac court dress. She appeared on the balcony, and behind her there was no exception to the elegant and serious black dress Camille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a knight, even if I’ve been waiting for her, watching out the window, outside the door, and still after she’s coming to the balcony, Lucien While feeling inside, I put down the "Bern" wine, walked to the window and opened the floor-to-ceiling window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Lucien." Natasha said with a relaxed greeting, then sneered, "Tonight, the silver moon is beautiful, I don't know." Are you interested in walking and enjoying the moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed out loudly: "You are really..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple past joke, suddenly let a few years of seeing a few gaps disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is the relationship between the Knights of the Day, Natasha’s appearance has not changed, it is still the most vivid and beautiful appearance in the 20s. Mature atmosphere and full of vitality, but her temperament is much more stable than ever before, like a big aristocrat who controls power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't change..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have matured a lot, more like a A man..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha speak at the same time, then smile at each other, the tacit understanding of good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Her Royal Highness, good evening, Ms. Camille." After laughing, Lucien greeted the shadow-like card behind Natasha. Mill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the power of the "wild shadow" Earl of Weit, Lucien was surprised to feel the "deep blue tide". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille nodded lightly, it was a return, and continued to follow Natasha quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha takes a slender leg with amazing beauty and strength, as if sitting in the sofa at the Latava Palace "War Gallery" without restraint On, then the purple eyebrows picked, carefully looked at Lucien: "Although Lucien is pretty good, but I still like your original look, black and black, handsome and beautiful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel that you are describing a woman?" Lucien also joked without restraint. In fact, when you cross, your appearance can only be barely counted, but with the study of music, various dangerous experiences, the temperament becomes quiet and calm, elegant and calm, and the appearance is more eye-catching, and then stimulates the moonlight, plus At that time, I was still young, so I gradually became handsome, but compared with the natural handsome men of Rhein, there is still a big gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha laughed twice and then proudly said: "I came out from the bottom of the monastery and thought that you might have returned to Aalto, even if there was no I will definitely come back within two or three months. I am worried that you can't find a chance to meet me, so I estimate when the passengers coming from the province of Tilan in the north will enter the city roughly, and then go back and forth to the manor every day. This way, even if you can't just meet it, you can wait for the fixed time to go to the road I passed after a little inquiring. Haha, who knows that today at the gate of the city, I directly sense the familiar atmosphere of Lucien." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I was worried about how to meet Natasha, but also to collect information about you like an assassin, and then sneak into your face." Lucien said his troubles at the time, smile gently Look at Natasha, "But the problem has been solved by the Princess of the Princess..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the distance is far, Natasha’s eyes are still dreamy purple Under the circumstances that can be so close, Lucien can see her silver purple purple under the purple eyes, crystal clear and deep and charming, as if to devour the hearts. It seems that after three years of hardships, she has thoroughly mastered the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmatively praised, Natasha became more and more happy, and asked with interest in Lucien in Allinge, in the Kingdom of Holm, on the journey. Experience in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the collapse of the Great Cross frame, Natasha must have known the existence of the Necromancer, but it is estimated to be the same as most known people. As an ordinary undead surname and heterogeneity space, Lucien concealed some of the encounters involving the important secrets of the dead spirits and the truth of the Miller experiment, the existence of the library, the bits and pieces that were mentioned in the letter and not mentioned. The drops are all coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that Natasha is a very good listener, can just ask questions and echoes, and casually talk about her own experience, let Lucien The surname is very strong, and it is not until the night is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucian’s experience, Natasha has already published a lot of opinions when she listened. At this time, her expression is weird: “Lu Xien, you It doesn't seem to tell you about your emotional experience? Is it not in Alin, where you can learn magic in the light, you haven't started a sweet love? This kind of life is very regrettable!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I just arrived in Allinge, I have to make up the basics of the Arcane, to improve my magical power, how can I chase the female surname, too busy, Grace, it is too busy, and should be Yes," Lucian answered with a bit of awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stretched out her right hand and rubbed her white chin, still the quirky expression: "It doesn't conform to common sense! Allinge's Girls, I remember that the level is generally higher than that of Rentat and Aalto. Lucien is young and excellent, his magical strength is very strong compared to his age, and the level of arcane is even more terrifying. He is the youngest Holm crown winner. So even if you are busy, there should be a girl who volunteers to show you good, isn't it true that you like men?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to spread by her own inclination . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible! It’s really too busy!" Lucien stressed. "In Aringe, there are indeed a few girls who hint, but I am They really don't feel tempted. Feelings like this kind of thing would rather not and can't make it happen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha left his chin with his right hand and patted the opposite Lucien’s shoulders are very eloquent: “It’s okay, I can understand, I won’t discriminate against you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really, Princess Highness, don’t think about it... ..." Lucien estimated that Natasha had already woven a "sweet love story" in her heart, which was reluctantly denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted two times, like a fox who stole a chicken, and then she transferred the topic with interest and asked in confusion: Why is it that someone will send you a letter to the Dark Mountain Range? Needless to say, isn’t it a waste of time? With the ability of the legendary magician to jump through the stars, it takes only afternoon tea to get from Aringe. Arriving deep in the dark mountains..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a very strong relationship with the great Arcanist Hathaway, and this aspect is more than Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been wondering, maybe there are other reasons, such as the king of nightmare worried about the impact of modern arcane theory, so refused to see the magician above the middle level... ..." Lucien guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha frowned for a moment: "It's hard to say. But you don't have to worry about Lucien, the Magic Council will definitely not let you have such amazing potential. The Arcanist is really killed in the dark mountains, and the legendary magician can't deal with you with care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finished, looked up at the wall clock, suddenly Laughing, the whole room seemed to have a splendid feeling: "It’s five o'clock, we have been talking for so long, I forgot to welcome you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, she stood up and took a picture of the court dress, showing a beautiful smile: "Welcome back, my knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
