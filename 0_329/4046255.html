			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-white stone floor stretches out like a real pale arm, they are holding the strong resentment and viciousness toward the top of the empty space, as if to catch When you get there, you won't relax, or you will tear it into pieces, or drag it to sink into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the wall and the right side of the bookshelf also have a muscle-bellied but transparent white arm that protrudes as if they form the deepest part of the legendary hell. The wall of the limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale arms around Lucien, Charlotte, and Sandra sensed the breath of the living, scrambling to grab them, and some grabbed their ankles. , heel, and some try to pull the arm of the horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just touched the body of Lucien, and the light group that turned around the crystal ball on the top of Lucien’s head lit up with dazzling brilliance. The pale arms in its radiance have all turned into white smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra's remaining three energy balls, also around her and Susan's body, kept making a line of rays, and surrounded all the pale arms Played fragmented, dissipated invisible, and the arms that caught Charlotte's body were uncontrollable from the floor, separated from the wall, and inhaled by the "spell absorption wall", letting the flow of magical runes It started to expand and became bigger, as if it would explode soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether waiting for Bill to tell, whether it is Charlotte, Sandra, or Lucien, they have not lifted their defense magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pale arms on the floor, walls, and bookshelves seem to be endless, and the more they are eliminated, the more they stick out, the more suspicion that they are connected to the horror behind them. The deepest part of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sandra’s head stretched out three unreal lines, directed to Lucien, Charlotte and Susan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that this is the third-ring magic "Second Mind Connection", Lussian and Charlotte did not refuse, let go of the mind, let it connect, Susan saw the two magicians accepting the connection and letting go of their own hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is only when you go to the bondage to destroy the summoning circle to completely solve the problem. If you are out, it is just a chance to completely resurrect the monster, and let it be comfortable. Play with us." Sandra's thoughts were introduced into the hearts of Lucien and others along the spiritual connection that had been integrated into the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic can directly convey the idea of ​​a magician, many times faster than speaking, and its high-end version is the best choice for magicians to fight and take risks. The only problem is the distance limitation and the destruction of the magic that is easily affected by the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte did not hesitate to agree with Sandra’s opinion: "The fog outside is blocked, I suspect that if you do not destroy the summoning circle between the restraints, you will kill The dead monster, it will not dissipate at all, and when we flee into the fog, it is the opportunity for monsters to kill us one by one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two battle mage I chose the offense because the connection with the outside world has been blocked, either staying behind or waiting for help, or killing the bloody road or fleeing or attacking. The former only chooses when you want to be jealous. It is the last desperate waiting, and only the wall of the limbs "The emergence, the monster has not yet launched an attack can judge that it is still in the resurrection, must firmly grasp this opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is easy to panic and break when running away, and the synergy of the three is difficult to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the bondage." As the leader of the squad, Lucien didn't have a slap in the face and made a straightforward decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Chamber’s wall as a result of the wall of the body, Bill closed again, Sander did not waste time to determine his safety, greet his face Susan followed her closely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she falls behind or is out of her protection in such a dangerous environment, Sandra will certainly not risk Susan at great risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan, as one of the two survivors who escaped from the castle, has no problem with his feet. The more he fears, the more he can exert his strength and firmly Sandra, who followed the re-cast of the "energy ball", ran forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was separated by a distance and finally played the speed of the Cavaliers superimposed with the "acceleration", dragging the residual shadow step by step. The starlight of "Maskillin Star" sprinkles the white arms protruding from the ground and the walls into white smoke, but this is only the magic of the three rings. After such high-intensity operation and consumption, eleven "Stars" soon had only eight left, and even occasionally the arms were stretched out and they couldn't be destroyed. They caught clothes and bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one arm extended, Lucien stepped on it as if he had stepped on the slippery, disgusting moss or the rotten meat, which made him feel creepy from his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians did not take care of the other, and they knocked down more than a dozen bookshelves and entered the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor is more disgusting than the apprentice hall, because it has walls on both sides, and it’s no longer just a pale, transparent body-like arm. The body of the carcass with the carrion or bloody wounds, and even a tongue with blood on the ceiling entangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra in the running, pointed the magic wand, the entire corridor suddenly brightened, all the light around it was absorbed, and a transparent arm The bloody arm and the tongue burned quickly into smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlotte also showed his own magic, two flaming flame walls appeared on both sides of the corridor, each arm must be stretched out Through the flames, and the flames are very restrained by the bodies of the corpses, they also have certain damage to the hands of the transparent soul. Therefore, even if they drilled the wall of fire, they often have no power and are easily purified by Sandra's "burning". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magicians who are good at fighting tacitly opened up a path so that Lucien, who is a few meters behind, can move forward without casting magic. This allows Lucien to free up his spirit and concentrate on other changes. Once they are in danger, they can immediately rescue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is itself a must-have for the magicians to fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corridor is very long, but at the speed of several magicians, it quickly reached the bottom, the hand of the soul, the hand of the body, the blood The tongue is getting more and more powerful, and some can even break through the fire wall and smash the fire to catch Charlotte and other people, almost scratching their defense, which seems to announce that the monster is getting closer and closer to the complete resurrection! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one arm that emerged from the floor began to seriously hinder the running of Lucien and others, especially at the corners where they were densely forested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Lucien condensed a red fireball in front of him and quickly crossed Charlotte and others on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, in the nearly sealed corridor, the sound echoes are so fierce, the raging air waves fly directly to many corpse arms, and the surrounding doors are blown up. Flying backwards, the waves on the wall and the cracks on the ground, a horrible crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arm forest at the corner is immediately less than one in five, becoming sparse, allowing Charlotte, Sandra, and Susan to easily In the past, when it was only the turn of Lucien, they came out a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the spirit of Lucian, carefully control the eight light groups above the head to change the trajectory around the "crystal ball" revolution, the two light groups seem to disturb the fate Two other tracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four groups hit each other in groups, hurriedly and silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the operation of "Maskillin Star", Lucien stepped into the corner, one with only an illusory or substantial arm The ground caught it, but they all fell by a few tens of millimeters. Unfortunately, they failed to catch Lucien, and even some of their arms caught each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of mistake has only occurred a few times in the long distance before, but now it has become very frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the uses of the "Maskillin Star". By disturbing the fate of the astrology, the other party is unlucky, no matter what it does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the arm returned to normal, but Lucian also passed the corner, just to see the power of Charlotte’s body, the palm of his hand, "Sell The absorbing wall "expanded to the limit, and the new "energy ball" surrounded by Sandra's head also broke four times in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the restrained door and wall in front of them, no longer the arm is extended, but a huge eye is condensed. They have black eyeballs, white pupils, dense linens all over the place, with strong evil, fear and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they glanced at them collectively, Lucien only felt that the soul was black, like breaking into the abyss or hell, the moment of the Maskillin star overhead All went out, the crystal ball fell out of glory, the powerful flame shield was faint, and the anti-death enchantment of the rune of the magical spell was also highlighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
