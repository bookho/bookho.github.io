			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground palace, Lucien, who held the "Frost" sword in both hands, dragged his shadow out of the hallway and cast himself "acceleration". Sophia followed closely, but the speed of the two could not be fully developed, because they had to pause and discern the direction so as not to go the wrong way in the ever-changing maze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't walk the front door, or you will step on the trap and provoke a terrible magical array." After carefully identifying the nearby magical pattern and comparing the map, Sophia refers Said at the end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxian, who was more than twice as quick as she parsed, frowned: "What should we do? It is a waste of time to crack the law." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia smiled, the previous panic fear seems to have completely disappeared: "Of course it is around the past, this is not a trial of the Magic Council, the test is the law Mastering and cracking. In the people who come in, apart from me, how many of them understand magic? They are not slowly groping by collecting intelligence and maps. When they encounter dangerous arrays, they detour, or wait for time. Passing away, the position of the squad changes by itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it take a long time to wait around the road?" Lucien felt like a "professor" who was tempted. In the judgment of female students by the remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia did not hesitate: "Detour, we enter this room, it is connected to another corridor."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed to the door of the mahogany door a few steps away, and she was quite proud of her expression, apparently possessing the pride of the caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the score! Lucine groaned in his heart, then walked a few steps and carefully pushed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun King’s underground palace has a natural suppression effect, and Sophia is right next to it, and Lucian is not good at the spiritual field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mahogany door is more immersive than Lucien, almost comparable to the heaviest metal, and as it slowly opens, a stench of smell Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" Sophia hurriedly reminded me, and then saw that "Bolaq" flashed to the side with little reaction time, as if prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed her green wand in her hand, screaming and screaming, and the smell of stench quickly dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poison gas?" Lucien knows why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia solemnly nodded: "Maybe someone passed by and touched the magic array, you have to be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She saw "Bolaq" clenching the blue sword and flashing into the house with the pace of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, the wardrobe, sofa, desk, etc. were either seriously damaged or fell to the ground, as if after a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the door, lying two young aristocratic men, their faces black, hands clasped like a chicken, a pool of dirty liquid . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be poisoned?" Lucien recognized them as a nobleman who followed Alten, and one of them even ignited the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush of excitement came from behind Lucine, Sophia also saw the two bodies, and the expression was gloomy again: "They are Denie's cousins. I can’t think of it but I’m dead here. No matter how it ends, your gorse family will face a lot of trouble. The power of many aristocratic families can’t be underestimated. You have to pay a very high price to calm them. The anger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn conspiracy planner, and the family traitor who works with him!" Lucien cursed like a member of the orthodox gorse family. Then, slowly move to the side of the two bodies and check the scars on them to judge what they have encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦? In the chest of one of the bodies, Lucien found obvious dents, which are not the same as normal humans can cause! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the move, Lu Xien slammed sideways, and behind the sound of the cracked wooden door, and the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien rolled away, the elbows slammed the ground and jumped into the body, seeing a tall statue of two people cast in steel. At two points in the eyelids, the red light flashed coldly, and the two hands held the giant hammer and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventing the urge to display "infrasound", Lucien steps lightly, sideways to avoid the front, hands clasping "frost", kneeling The side of the giant hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, the hammered metal slammed, the giant hammer was hit a lot, and Lucian’s hands were severely numb and slightly trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of terror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Iron Golem exceeds that of the ordinary Grand Knight, and Lucien, who wears the Ogre's Gloves, is a bit overwhelmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster seems to be completely unaffected, the giant hammer took a half circle and hit the road to Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's hands are shining with silver and white, the layer of ice on the top of the sword is cold and blue, and the hilt is recovered, against the giant hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding winds are fierce, suddenly solidified, turned into countless blue blades, the steel magic statue, but only a shallow stroke on the silver-white body mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia, who has no fighting experience, seems to have chosen the wrong magic for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! The unaffected steel golem waved a giant hammer and made a slap in the face with Lucien’s “Frost” sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has not had a melee fight for a long time, facing the power to press his own steel monster, and the room that appears to be small has not left him to flash The space can only be blocked by swords and swords. According to the knight skills taught by Natasha and John, take a step back and relieve the enormous pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Iron Golem is enough to rival the top five-level knights. Lucien is left-right and right-handed under its attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more difficult the situation, the more the road is suffocating, even if the hands are unable to restrain the trembling, still can hold the sword, the steel The Golem's attack once and for all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue light keeps shining, the giant hammer of the Iron Golem and the body gradually become a layer of frost, although it can not bring it damage, but let Its speed has become slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small changes in "Surprising Waves" are so obvious in the heart of Lucien's preoccupation, immediately stepping forward, avoiding the giant hammer, spitting out the sound, waving long Sword, squatting at the knee joint of the Iron Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! Since the battle, Lucien has hit the Iron Golem for the first time, and a layer of solidified ice crystals appears at the knee joint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although with the force of the Iron Golem, this layer of ice crystals instantly shattered, but it brought a short stagnation, and was seized by Lucien. Once again, kneel on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind whispers, a blue gust of wind condenses into a rope, entangled the knees, elbows, wrists, neck, etc. of the Iron Golem, let it act It has become more and more sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s attack seems to have inspired Sophia to allow her to work effectively! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this opportunity, Lucien stepped forward in a violent and rainy attack in front of the Iron Golem, a sword swayed, dodging again and again, When the sound of the Dangdang is heard, the body is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel golem eyes flashed red, the iron jaw opened, and a yellow-green gas erupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants to dodge, but the gas is blown away by the sudden hurricane, drifting toward the back of the steel magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dispelling the smoke", Sophia reacted miraculously and chose the right magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s foot slammed forward, escaping the fallen giant hammer, and the sword once again slammed the knee joint and let the steel golem The action is like rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lucien suddenly felt the strong suction from the opposite side, and finally stabilized the "frost" sword, and the steel magic image was even more unbearable, and it was difficult to advance by the invisible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, the steel magic figure emits a slight metal twist, and the red light of the eyes quickly extinguishes, and the bang slams on the ground like a mountain collapse . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia seems to finally think of it. The best magic to deal with steel monsters is the "strong magnetic field" class, so the five-ring "strong magnetic shock" in the magic of talent is displayed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this is the palace of the Sun King, not the palace dominated by the storm, or else it will have to support for a while." Lucien secretly said. The Magic Golem's latest model of the Iron Golem has been able to maintain a few minutes of combat power in a strong magnetic field, enough to kill most mid-level magicians and great knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thinking about it, Lucien violently gasped and became a formal magician, he had not had such a terrible melee fight. Under the amazing power of the Iron Golem, every second is in jeopardy. On several occasions, "the professor's second harmonic resonance" is carried out regardless of the consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after this battle, Lucien only felt flustered and bloody, and although the sweat was flowing, his hands were trembling, he was exhausted, but he was very refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a faithful feedback from the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to keep exercising in the future, you can't ruin your body..." Lucien suddenly had a weird idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Bolaq" gasping and not talking, Sophia is awkward and shy and blushing: "I, I didn't mean it, I met Iron Devil for the first time." Like, the knowledge of the usual study will be forgotten, and then I will remember it later. Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the first battle is like this, Princess Her Royal Highness." You don't mind." Under the blood, Lucien felt that his strength was recovering very quickly, but his heart was thinking about irrelevant issues. Sophia is said to be the blood of the "Angel of the Wind", but it can cast a strong magnetic field magic. Does the power of the wind in this world really represent the electromagnetic force? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lucian’s knowledge, among the four elements that the Magic Council redefines, the wind element represents electromagnetic force, and even most of the Arcanists They also think so, and they also regard the earth elements as gravity in a more unified way, only the fire element and the water element, and there has been no recognized basic force explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first brutal battle, it’s good to have you as my guardian knight." Sophia said with a soft and moving look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my pleasure." Lucien answered with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia nodded lightly: "Then we take a break and move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for her to show When the magic checked the front channel, Lucien looked down and shook his head and said: "Have she been testing my strength and playing cards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless really scared Or, no one teaches what is called spell concentration, otherwise there may not be such a long interval between several magics! As a knight's "Bolaq" is really unclear, but as a high-ranking magician, Lucien is an "expert professor". In more than a minute of melee combat, Sophia has only applied four magics, deducting the buffer. She has plenty of time to re-enter the spell-casting state, and even if she doesn't think of the right magic, she will try the surname several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regained strength, Lucian and Sophia continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bypassing the room with the dangerous magic array, the two suddenly entered the other hall directly from one hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this hall, there have been more than a dozen nobles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph and Claire each have two or three companions, and they are far away from Alten and others, and there are a few flesh and blood in the center. The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a panic and gnashing look on their faces that seemed to be scared by the real death tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
