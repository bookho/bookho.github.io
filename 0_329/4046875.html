			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement floats in the darkness outside the cave, looking at the situation without expression, whether it is a strange pattern, or a strong hatred, hate And desperate emotions have been dissipated. If there is not a little residual scent, there is still a small magical ritual. No one can guess from this residual scent. The specific content of that small magical ritual and whether it is part of a large ritual. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After an hour, this extraordinary atmosphere is also dissolved in nature, and everything that has happened is completely annihilated in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement has displayed prophetic magical techniques such as "Praying for God" to try to get "the revelation of the gods", but in addition to those he already knew There is nothing outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strength of the other party is at least not worse than me, and it is fully prepared in advance, so I can't predict the true situation, even the 'Lord of the Lord' Can't do it..." Clement froze slightly. If the "Lord of Hell" is here for the first time, then He will certainly "predict" the truth, but He is far away from the endless ocean, in a more "distant" The ninth floor of Hell was only noticed by the power of abnormal emotions, and it has already missed the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement interrupted the prophetic genius and analyzed the possible objects on his own: "The strength is not worse than me... From this point alone, St. Ivan There are not many suspects in the fort, unless there are other outsiders, but it is impossible to do such a full preparation in our most tightly controlled St. Ivan.... Yes, the power of negative emotions needs the most The lower first-order 'container', I have to see who is 'not seen'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the other party has completed the state transition. Clemente was not too anxious to go to the cathedrals to determine the life and death of the Holy Spirit pastor and the holy knight, but patiently waited until the early morning to exchange the current undercurrent as an excuse. They visited the members of the Cardinal Mission respectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your opinion is very important, I will consider it..." Outside of St. Felix's Cathedral, Clemente politely communicated with another. The saints of strength say goodbye, and the inner heart is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With oneself, none of the Seven Great Saints was missing, not in the cathedrals of St. Ivan. . It is in the key area of ​​self-defense - after being connected through the voice magic array, it is confirmed by prophecy, and the rest of the Holy Spirit pastor, the holy knight and the epic knight of the empire are mostly like this, only two or three are secrets. The mission was unable to contact for a while, but there was no indication that they had fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, there is no "container". Is the person who completes the state transformation the legend of other forces that are hunted or the strong ones who are seclusion alone? Clemente became more and more surprised that this thing was a bit strange, waiting for him to come back and found himself unconsciously outside the St. Ivan Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not be the "container" of the Pope? Clemente has a whimsy, normal people should not be so bold. But maybe which madman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this in mind, Clement went into the Cathedral of St. Ivan and asked to see Pope Bilkovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, he saw a tall, bear-like Berkovsky in the study, and he still had a loud voice and a yellowish eyes. The nose is "high". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clement, do you seem to have some thoughts?" Berkovsky hinted that he already knew that Clement frequently visited and contacted the Cardinal today. Members, empire and affiliated national epic knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement was shocked, he was too anxious, and should be done in a few days, if nothing last night benefited from "the Lord of Hell "The deep sense of the power of the ancient devil and the emotions, even the state converters themselves do not know that things have been leaked, and what they have probably exposed today." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is sincere and fearful: "The monsters of the Dark Council have swallowed up a few small countries in the northern part of the Dark Mountains, intimidating the Mother Earth Church, I am worried about the Mother Earth. I will vote for them. I want to secretly obstruct this incident, so I exchange ideas with the cardinal and epic knights, and I hope to reach an agreement and make suggestions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is something to talk to me in the future.” Berkovsky didn’t say much because it was the Northern Church, unlike the Southern Church. The pope has absolute authority and decision-making power, and this large-scale private exchange is seen as a sign of "the Lord's spokesperson on the ground" and the intention to split the church. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, under normal circumstances, there will be no saints who challenge the authority of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clemente breathed a sigh of relief and respected the authenticity: "I am here to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After the exchange of the current situation, Clement returned to the Cathedral of St. Gono and turned over and over to find the place he missed. Unfortunately, due to the influence of the mindset, he did not understand the mysterious state transitioner. What is the "container", after all, the legendary strongman is so much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, he thought of himself: "The material of my refining container is still missing a few special ones. Is it going to the 'Lord of the Lord'? Borrow a little... No, he still doesn't know that I don't use the law of negative emotions, but relies on the book of Virtue... Hey, if the body of St. Gonno can be used, the body of the gods, accumulated for centuries The power is enough to get me close to the legendary peak and it will take a long time to break through, the body, the bodies of the saints!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement suddenly thought of a Maybe, the heart is surprised and shocked, and the facial muscles are faintly distorted. Is it really one of them? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled on the spot, drawing a cross on the chest, short and left, and his eyes closed, and the divine glow behind him condensed into a light group. Gradually turned out a golden-eyed angel of light, and then the still cold, boring black and white gray pervaded around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Spiritual Circle, the Temple of the Dead, the Holy Spirit Room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five black shovel are placed there quietly, each with a fascinating and difficult-to-touch divine light ball above or in front, suddenly A divine light ball above the top is like something flying in. Quickly grow and grow bigger, turning into an angel with a golden eye and a six-winged back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement's consciousness is attached to the glory of the divine, and looks at the room of the Holy Spirit, which is quiet like a grave, and feels a long-lasting vicissitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?" Clement looked at the other four. The heart is hesitant. If it is wrong, the corresponding saints will definitely feel it. At that time, it is difficult for them to explain why they are doing this. Although they will not be killed, they will definitely be Pope and The saints excluded the core circle as a careerist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He displays prophetic magic. I hope to give myself a hint, and the results can be predicted to be varied, including any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his head, Clement thought he was still standing behind a "Lord of the Lord", so he made up his mind to prepare to check his most suspicious object. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the forefront, standing in front of the erected St. Ivan, the six angel wings behind it gently fanned, the right hand extended, slow Slowly pushed open the lid, a good-looking novel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. The hoarse and heavy friction broke the quiet silence of the Holy Spirit Room, and the hollow behind the cover was empty, only the iron black glowed cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement's golden eyelids suddenly solidified, like anger, really empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the rebellion of the holy city of Reims, and the self-reliant northern church of St. Ivan was gone! His divine body and the power accumulated over generations are gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, Berkovsky. He completed the state transition!" Clement could not restrain his anger, for Berkovsky Betrayed the "ideal" and angry, and was angry that he was not so easy to accomplish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only knows at this time why Pope Vikken secretly announced the law of the gods, did not consider the saints of the northern church, to provoke the relationship, because He It must be understood that the divine body of several saints and the power accumulated by generations, the state transformation only needs to collect the power of emotions, relatively simple, and the power of the beliefs controlled and stolen by the northern church. The accumulation of divine glory, the preparations for the God-like roads have long been perfected, enough to support a "resource" that a kind of god needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this road involves an understanding of divinity and faith, the failure may be great and must be grasped by a long time. Berkovsky may Already trying to shock..." Clemente thought angrily and enviously, and he was still far from the state transition, but he was not sure that Berkovsky lacked the combination of the two. Partially secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
