			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are they two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is Veronica Some of the magicians of the blond beauty, such as those who are proficient in blood and blood, often present two extremes. One is that they don’t care about their image at all, how to transform themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the left eye is replaced by the "eye of the eye", the right eye becomes the "eye of death" of the "death servant", and the beard is so eager The magical tentacle is amazed and has become synonymous with “terrorist scaryness” in the eyes of all ordinary people. At the same time, they are also the image of the magician deliberately propagandized by the truth god. Of course, at this stage, this part of the magician must also Change the shape to dare to go out, otherwise it is the target of the vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some other magicians are very concerned about their appearance, they will pay attention to this aspect when they are transforming themselves, so the appearance is more delicate and beautiful, Veronica is Such an eight-ring master who is proficient in blood fusion and physical transformation, for example, her ears are slightly pointed, which makes her bright and charming people more playful and cute, which is the character of the elf blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Annold laughed and said: "This 'party' held in Aringe is mainly for everyone to communicate and contact, to eliminate differences and misunderstandings... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words he said in the first half are obviously "official clichés" to other magic organizations, followed by his words: "So, as the master We must control the strength of our participation in the 'party', otherwise it will easily lead to suspicion and destroy the rare atmosphere of cooperation, so that they are afraid to come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Here, I am the president and the main liaison. I must preside over the party. This is the basic courtesy and respect. Douglas is the new Master who joins us. His presence will make others feel the attraction and true strength of the union. Fernando is the leader of our younger generation of magicians. It is the most promising candidate for the Master. He can let other organizations fully appreciate the future of the union, the union's vitality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has no direct ridicule But secretly Fu Fei Road, simple, does not exceed the limits of a show of strength to deter other organizations, the president seems to be saying the whole truth at his side, as indeed the president! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this explanation, Rieg and Veronica are more agreeing, no more to say anything, instead ask "red eyes", "soul supreme", etc. The details of the organization - although they have learned a lot in the past, how can Anord, the president who has just visited each other, know clearly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold also took the opportunity to popularize these organizations with the first-time Douglas: "The typical appearance of the Arthurian people is a pair of red eyes. Look at Fernando." I know, of course, the pupils like him are so rare that they are rare in the Arthur Empire. The 'Red Eyes' organization was established by a group of surviving magicians of the Arthurian Empire. I hope to be able to rejuvenate in the future..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“'Soul is High' is an organization of the Necromancer, which is said to have something to do with the 'Death Scythe'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Shadow Singer" was the secret organization of the original "Shadow Lord" Osiris for his "return", but it was unfortunately hit by the "heart of time", and the strength declined not as good as us..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tower of the Destroyer is dominated by the Elemental Master, which was retained more than a hundred years ago by the 'Elemental Will' destroyed by the Sword of Truth together with the clergy. One of several branches..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes "Elemental will", Douglas is no stranger. After the "Lord of Shadows" suffered heavy losses, the legendary magicians of the "Great Holm area" split internally and fight for each other. Some of them belong to the ancient organization. Some have established their own organization, "Elemental Will" is a very active and legendary organization during this period. At its peak, it is almost comparable to the long-standing "Parmela's Cabin", but ultimately Still failing to escape the fate of destruction, most of the magicians died, valuable materials and objects were divided by the Hoffenberg family and the god of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annode explained in detail the source, composition and information of the respective leaders of the four magic organizations, and finally sighed: "I hope this time can Smoothly united, as long as the cardinal Alfonso was killed and the 'dark blue demon' was initially shocked, I was confident that with his name, I would cooperate extensively with several of you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not mention that after the assassination of Alfonso, the church was furious, and the "dark blue gift" Sharp did not soften the attitude at all, but accelerated the possibility of cracking down on magical organizations. He knew that Rieger, Ramon and Veronica also It's very clear, but the current situation makes them only choose to take risks. If you want to take great action, you will have no chance to take risks in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. President, Big Holm... There are still a few legendary lords on this side of the strait?" As an Antiphler, Douglas used to call it. Here is the "Great Holm area", but he changed his mouth in time, because Fernando and others are the remains of the Arthur Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord smiled and said: "Besides rushing to Aalto to participate in the defense, there are only three legendary mages left in the Strait. Of course, the legendary lords There are very different ways of life-saving, and perhaps you have not completely died in the hands of the truth, just hiding them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Palmera’s cottage has two lords, 'Iceland Witch' and 'The Lord of the Deep Cold', among which 'The Lord of the Deep Cold' is stronger, so go to support Aalto and let the younger 'ice The Witch's lord's left-behind organization..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Death Scythe' has a terrible 'death lord', he is a senior legend of the Arthur empire, with Aalto The lords have a bad relationship, so they have not rushed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary "Music of the Chaos" has been degraded, but for decades Before, one of them was successfully promoted by a distinguished nine-ring wizard. The legendary occupation is the 'curse of the eye', called Atlante, Fuman, very young. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas listened and whispered the content that needed to be focused: "...the ice witch...the death lord...the cursed eye ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The basic situation is like this, Douglas, Fernando, you are ready, we will go to 'Aringe' tomorrow." Annod's dagger Indicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky seems to be burnt through the fire, the ground is red but bleak, The three men of Anord, Douglas and Fernando became the giant mouse common in this plain, moving between plants and gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the plain near Renttat. It is located in the northwest, surrounded by mountains and separated by many villages. It is not like a dark magic at first glance. The hiding place chosen by the division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the 'City of the Sky' fell, a big hole was made at the foot of the mountain, which caused an earthquake and buried it, so it was actually The bottom of the plain is the bottom of the plain.” Anord introduced Douglas to the location of “Aringe”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is currently an obese gray-haired mouse that connects through the mind: "So its damage should be serious?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the core alchemy life has dissipated, and none of the buildings above are complete..." Fernando said instead of Anord, he is now a small mouse with red eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three mice followed the real mouse hole, all the way deep into the ground, and soon passed through many obstacles, embarked on the underground passage of the former Union of Magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they turned back to humans, along this road paved by boulder, there are no common murals, patterns, etc. on both sides, only rugged rocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking along, Douglas suddenly paused, his eyes obsessively looking at the front, only in the mud and rock squeeze, there is a magnificent thing . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very huge, formed by the inverted half of the mountain peak, the lower point is flat, the loop is a loop, and the symbols are embedded in it, which makes people feel shocked from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the buildings such as the magic tower on the plane collapsed, and the most complete preservation is only three or four layers, and the main mountain peaks have another obvious The rift, deep bottomless, seems to be through it, shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the 'city of the sky'?" Douglas looked hot and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod let him watch for a while: "I will go to private contact with the leaders of other magic organizations to get a consensus before the party. You walk around and get to know the magicians of other organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
