			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the black door slowly opening, Lucien will hold the shield of truth in his left hand tighter. If it is the monster, then follow Himself and Rhine. The inference is probably the strength of the legendary peak. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red eyes, short man, slightly dragged to the magic robe on the floor, handsome but old-looking face... This familiar thing makes Lucien blur out: "Teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he saw the tall old man behind the teacher Fernando, and the dignified Douglas: "His Lord."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not answer immediately, but was silent for ten seconds, as if to confirm the identity of Lucien in the dark, then he seemed relieved: "There is no danger here. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando used magic to push open the black door and suddenly felt There are two breaths in it, so it is even more alert. The robes of the Lord, the eyes of the storm, and the steep turn are all ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he heard the voice of Lucien: "Teacher, Lord Speaker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The worries in the heart suddenly eliminated a lot, but he did not carelessly, quietly using various magic means to confirm the identity of Lucien, Douglas is also using astrology to verify the special "destiny secret". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the breath, mental fluctuations and other characteristics tell Lucine It is indeed my own teacher and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. However, the previous encounters made him dare not have the slightest wish. The "Shield of Truth" is still the same: "Lord of the Speaker, teacher, there is a monster here that can be truly changed into Everyone, no matter what the characteristics are, I just met it as Mr. Rhein. The induction of the origin of the blood was simulated by it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Fernando's eyes glanced: "You mean we are monsters disguised? Can it be disguised even with a half-plane projection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wearing a black storm From the lightning, thunder, "Thunder and Hell" came directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the familiar roar and storm, Lucien’s heart was hot, and some believed to be teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas thought about it: "Lu Xien, since you are still with the Earl of Silvereye, that means you have other ways to confirm each other's identity, What do we need to do to cooperate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are using the ancestor's breath to confirm, I don't think you have such a possibility." Rhein smile instead of Lucy En replied, "But the matter is very simple. It is not far from the entrance. We don't have to walk with you, and both of them are legendary peaks, and we won't be able to return. When we wait outside, everything will be clear."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dangerous place of "the world of the door", there are monsters that can be disguised as anyone. The human heart is always full of suspicions. Lucien has not yet been on the Rhine. Eliminate the last warning, so he agreed with his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando growls: "Noisy! Since there are such horrible monsters, will it quietly watch you leave? Can't you confirm my identity!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roared to roar, but quite sensible, no small monsters, let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, you first go to the entrance, we will then guard against the monster's pursuit." Douglas did not surprise the Rhine proposal, gently beheaded and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the two legendary magicians stood in the corner of the gray hall, leaving the black door, and Lucien and Rhein very carefully Walked close to the entrance door, each side of the door, and waited until the door was about to relax a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Douglas and Fernando also left the place and followed behind the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of move is no problem, but Lucien is secretly anxious, his own transformation is over, and he wants to play again for a few seconds. Blood circulation time, this is very dangerous for a few seconds, the current environment can not allow any omissions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must think of a way to confirm their identity... Lucien’s thinking is spinning fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Rhine is about to open the black door in front, Fernando and Douglas are worried that the two encounter the legendary monster, so they are getting closer and closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they suddenly heard Lu Xien open: "His President, teacher, wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Fernando seems to suppress the anger of not being faithed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine is looking at Lucien strangely, not knowing what he is going to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked very solemnly: "His speaker, teacher, how to solve the two-electron atomic model with matrix mechanics?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Fernando and Douglas stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The breath, mental fluctuations, and blood characteristics are consistent..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophecy that his position is deviated, but it may not be a 'destiny secret', because other methods can be used to create similar effects..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind connection, Fernando and Douglas communicated closely, and they were not allowed to pay attention to all the dangerous places with their careless and repeated adventures. I will not blindly believe in my magic, and here is the deepest part of the dead spirit world, where many legendary magicians have disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be Lucien, but even if it is really Lucien, can't carelessly be deceived by the devil, is there less magician who has deviated from his surname? "Fernando is not violent at this time. He has almost died in the past in his adventures because of his family name. He has been able to effectively restrain himself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the shield of truth, Lucien was delighted and eagerly said: "His Lord, teacher, there is a horrible monster here, reaching the legendary peak, if not me In the case of Mr. Rhein, at the crucial moment, he was summoned to help the help of Silver Moon Aitna, temporarily repelling the monster, I am afraid I have died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's get out of here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the Earl of Silvereye?" Douglas looked around in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando frowned slightly: "Just a legendary monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just" this The words fully demonstrate his "dominey". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I was separated from him after that, and here is the 'world of the door'. Without knowing the coordinates, there is no way to find it." Lucien was slightly dismayed. "And the monster may be more horrible than what we saw. I got some of Mr. Muskilllin’s relics and notes filled with despair and hysteria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notes, relics? Take a look." Douglas dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out the gray notes and the relics of the dark green, and put away the "Shield of Truth", which was handed over to Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." Douglas suddenly stopped, "Send with magic, don't come close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Lord of the Speaker? What do you mean?" Lucien seems to be puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is kind and authentic: "This is the deepest part of the dead world, and any changes can happen, so it's better to be careful, well, it's not far from the entrance. Go out and see again, you go first, we will follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded: "This is a very correct way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary 愕 Then, Douglas laughed and said: "The question is not yet answered. Thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
