			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver is also a "warrior" who has experienced several dangers of life and death, and he has not scared his hands and legs, no resistance, and subconsciously Dodging alongside, waving a short sword, trying to escape the road. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, his strength is much worse than that of Captain Gregory, and Grigri has effectively used the length of the sword to carry out a series of swings. Cut, so that he can not get close, can not play the advantage of the short sword, can only passively lift the sword and resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang, after a few crisp sounds, the short sword slammed into the ground, Oliver's right hand cracked open, blood oozing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory smirked, stepped forward, and the sword slashed, stepping down the scope of Oliver's dodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few moments, Oliver found himself forced into the corner, whether it was going left or right or forward, he had to face the flash of light Long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword fell, Oliver's scalp numb, something seems to open in the body, irritating his eyes a bloody red, unconsciously clasping the only thing in his hands , greeted the long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, a muffled sound came, Oliver stepped back again, and stayed close to the cold wall, the blood of the right hand tiger mouth overflowed more, the crystal blue The staff was stained with a touch of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Grigora didn't care. When there was a short sword, Oliver couldn't beat himself. Now he is holding a non-defective short stick. Don't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that made him feel a little shaken is that this crystal clear stick seems to be quite precious. If it is broken, he will definitely feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he turned to think of the room full of gems and possible magic items, shaken quickly disappeared, anyway, there are so many valuable things, this short Lose the loss of the rod, you must hurry to kill Oliver, find the institution to close the entrance, prevent others from stealing the treasure with yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in my heart has just come, his sword has been one, the rough movement has become meticulous, picking up the short stick and stabbing Oliver’s chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the swaying tip of the sword, Oliver’s fear broke out, only the whole world became very slow, and the tip of the sword snails stabbed toward his chest. But I can only think so fast, my body is as "slow" as Griegera's long sword, and I can only watch the sword spurting myself a little bit, and I can't react at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short moment, Oliver fell into a peculiar ethereal state, and then his mind seemed to have a broken chord like a broken string, then He felt that something in his soul rushed out and flowed to the blue short stick with his hands clasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; Surrounded by the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silvery arc on the short stick that hit Grigri's key points without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory’s face and chest were quickly burnt, and the long sword stabbed Oliver’s body but could only force it to slip, only creating a shallow wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I die... He stares blankly at the short stick that is still in front of the electric spark, and his body falls softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long confirmed that Oliver is not a magic apprentice, even if the short stick is an extraordinary item, he certainly can't use it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this be? Grigora’s eyes are round and round, and he’s not dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he slowed down and slowly raised his head. His eyes, nostrils and corners of his mouth had a touch of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was a meditation breakthrough, the mental impact of becoming an apprentice inspired a short stick?" His head thought a little confused, "The short stick should not have Is it the core mark? Has it been erased long ago..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and looked at Grigora with his hands on the scepter, only to see The powerful captain who usually fears himself is lying here without any anger. His face is black and his eyes are round and he can't die any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver is not at ease, specializing in his majesty, carefully examining the body of Grigora, and after confirming it is correct, he is shocked and delighted to look at the short stick: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the power of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calmed down and closed At the entrance, I found another secret exit, and then packed the books, objects, and gemstones in the storage bag left by the Master and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that he doesn’t want to settle here temporarily, but he’s going to improve his strength first. It’s because there’s no food here, and in a few days, he’s going to starve here. More than 90% of the creatures above the wilderness are stronger than him, but they prefer to kill each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Fernando came to the wasteland and was looking to retreat to The "Dance of the Dance" organization here, as far as he knows, "The Eye of the Curse" Atlante, although not hiding during this time, is not reconciled, integrates many small organizations, and makes up for the dance of ** "The loss in the last incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, he simply couldn’t get the news and couldn’t find it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is not clear about the specific location of the "Dance of the Dance", only to the vicinity, through the test of the secret surveillance magician, can be brought in . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there are traces of magical institutions open." The recent madness of the night watchman made Fernando choose to be careful and dare not fly boldly, so in the spirit Within the sensing range, he suddenly found a more obvious trace. At first glance, there was no trace of effective treatment when the rookie left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which ruins of the magician are hidden here?" Fernando’s mood is getting better, not because he is greedy, but because there is not much known in the past. The All-Union Magician Joint Parliament is really lacking in foundation, not only lacking materials, but also lacking money. At the beginning of the change of Kuks, the most serious damage was the Union of Wizards, and the two undead vice presidents organized the organization. Heritage, I don’t know where to hide now, leaving the only city in the ruins of Douglas and Fernando, the city of the sky, Allinge. If Heatheri sponsored a large sum of money, Fernando’s exchanges with other organizations will not I know how shabby it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he paused the move, cast spells, and created "secret eyes" and other things, carefully scrutinized the surroundings, confirmed the security before they started cracking The efforts of the magic organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About half an hour, a click, a small door collapsed above the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando checked it again and the action flew in and found that most of the gems, materials and objects were gone, leaving a little corner . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s late, if you meet the rookie before, you can lie to him, hey, introduce it to the parliament." Fernando sighed with awkwardness. A cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the magic book was taken away, and the traces of the remaining battles, he preliminarily judged that the treasures were taken by the apprentice-like spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grass in the valley grows, shrouded in faint, constantly changing Misty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika is holding the thick black cover of the book, reading the above content insanely, and calculating from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original we are on the planet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is the ground element the source of gravity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The planet is actually working like that...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No wonder we will land after jumping..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small sighs, arguments echo around Elika, a magician or excited Excited or frowningly discussing "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book subverts their understanding of the world and gives them a sense of disillusionment that the original world is like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a precedent for creating a surname, there are definitely many people who will recognize that the world is shaking, or collapse or solidify. Even so, they also have The feeling that the three views were refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the stars on the fog, they seem to see the mysterious star trajectory, everything is no longer so irregular, but Mastering!! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika looked at it for a while, put the book down, rubbed his head, and looked like a debilitating one. It’s too painful to read this book, especially Look at this book in the absence of knowledge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was taught by Douglas about calculus, but at the time it was just a foundation, and many of them were still awkward, so I learned the mathematical principles of magical philosophy. "It is extremely difficult. I want to write a letter to Douglas, but I find that I can't contact him at the moment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Elika starting to smash his head, the surrounding magicians rushed like rabbits, their eyes condensed on her face, and they asked Kendao:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elika, it is time to teach us calculus!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This What should I do with the points?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How does the spell model be treated with calculus?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is like flying flies around Erica, making her brain more confused and more irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can look at the eyes and expressions of men, women and children, her heart is soft, yeah, I have a foundation of calculus, I can watch While learning by themselves, they don’t understand anything, they can barely look at the description related to gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she has a strong sense of pride, there are no shortage of high-level magicians, there are many middle-level wizards who usually look better than themselves, but they all I have to ask myself, and even recently, Lord Atlante is asking myself the knowledge of calculus. Calculus is an epoch-making progress in the field of mathematics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika looked around at the expression of everyone, and suddenly there was a violent and uncontrollable joy. After Aalto’s fall, his companions were numb. Despair, like undead, the book "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" is like a beacon in the night, illuminating the darkness, dispelling despair, and letting them all have little hope, not magic. Just because we have not done enough before! The understanding of this world is still too far away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope is immortal, the inheritance of magic will never stop! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika’s mouth squirmed quietly, began to worry about happiness, and explained calculus for his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a magician flew in and asked the sergeant who was in the crowd to ask: "Mr. Vice President, there is a high called Fernando. The magician in the deep mountain hut asked to see, has passed the inspection, let him not come in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vice president also answered in the future, Erica stood suddenly Get up: "Mr. Fernando? He is very good at calculus!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Mr. Douglas said! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The vast majority of magicians still don't know that Douglas has been promoted to the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
