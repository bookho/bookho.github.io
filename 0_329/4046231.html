			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the attention of the Supreme Council on this collaborative research project, plus its main involvement in elements and necromantics, all of the two research-oriented in Aringe The faction Arcane divisions have been transferred, which naturally includes the Arcane Audit Committee's Ravendi, Gaston, Locklint, Pesor and other authoritative Arcane divisions and most of them are qualified to help They review the middle-level arcian of the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a temporary place in the "Sariwa" manor to submit a paper for review, so that the arcane divisions who participated in the project can be the first Time to submit your own research results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the room full of magical arrays, Lucien saw the Woods of the Ordinary Arcanist Monthly appearing on the other end of the corridor: "Good noon Mr. Woods, I didn’t expect to see you here, I remember that you are good at force field and astrology.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Evans. But I Now also the deputy editor of the Ordinary Arcanist Monthly, of course, come over and see which of the Arcanist's research results can be published in our journal. Who told you that the elements and the two elements of the Necromancer have written high The Arcanists who have the ability to level the papers are concentrated here. Our "Organic Arcanist Monthly" is not like "Arcane" and "Magic" can wait for others to contribute and have to come over."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods smiles at the jaw, because two weeks ago the Periodic Table of the Elements, he has reviewed the Arcanist to become the deputy editor of the "Organic Arcanist Monthly", while discovering new elements of the thesis arcane The points have always been high, and the correctness of the periodic table has been verified. , Which makes his long stay in grade four arcanist seems promising breakthrough in a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Woods with the golden character Hu looked at Lucien with concern: "After I got here, I heard about Ivan from the familiar arcane master. You have been attacked, so go to your room to visit you, and the maid tells me that you are here. Hey, look at what you are not so bad now, I am relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, except for his pale face, his body has recovered almost the same, but the "deformed robe" needs to be repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern, Mr. Woods. I am only the target of the attack. The attacker mainly targeted Mr. Felipe and did not cause a physical surname to me. The injury is basically due to the anti-phasing of the more use of the 'element' ring." Lucien told Woods while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being brought back to the manor by Lavendi and Gaston, the people who knew Larry, Timothy, Ulysses and others came one after another. I have visited, but because the news is still blocked, even the elves such as Elstin and Exeter are not known, so friends such as Lazar have not arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods frowns slightly: "This kind of counter-attack should not look to recover quickly. In fact, for Evans, your soul and body are hidden and hidden dangers that will make you Life expectancy is shortened. However, Evans has the hope that you will become a high-ranking person before the age of 50. The problem is not that big. In the future, you can use less and use less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two chatted and went to the room where Lu Xien had just recuperated. Just arrived at the door, Woods thought of something like a smile: "Before it was the place to submit the paper, did you write a research paper? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this week's results of arcane research, on three alchemy substances that can boost food production and their large-scale production methods." Sean smiled and pushed the door open as if to say a very ordinary paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods was slightly surprised and funny looking at Lucien: "I have seen your project briefings these days, it seems to have encountered a bottleneck, but just turned around I heard that Evans has studied it. It really makes me a little unbelievable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was also the result of the research of the Arcanists in the project briefing. Inspired by the results of the analysis of the fertilizer and fecal composition after the burning of the vegetation, I switched to three attempts to dissolve the alchemicals in the water.” Lucien asked the maid who was at the door to pour a cup of black tea to Woods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods took a sip of black tea and laughed: "It turned out to be the case. If these three alchemy substances can really be mass produced and popularized, then the food The output will be greatly improved, and many magicians and knights will become more affluent. Evans will also be able to get the results of the popular surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp As a man of a magician's family, Woods grew up in Aringe, had no hard life experience, no business mind, plus he was a middle-level arcian, with the bottom farmer, the poor, etc. A completely different class may have a heart and compassion for them, but it is only an occasional emotion, so I don't think that Lucian's paper is of great significance. This project can be valued by the Magic Council, mainly the Lord of the Supreme Council who wants to study natural magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods put down the teacup, smiled but solemnly said: "I don't know if Evans can hand over this paper to our "Organic Arcanist Monthly"?" Although this month is only a small half, if you can make this high-profile One of the main results of the research project was included in advance, and the total number of times the next issue of the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" will definitely increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and replied: "I have said that if there is an opportunity, I will continue to contribute to Mr. Woods, and Mr. Woods is the first to come to me. Well, as long as my paper can be reviewed by the committee members, I personally would like to publish it in the "Organic Arcanor Monthly"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I represent "ordinary The Arcanist Monthly magazine expresses gratitude to Evans. Right, can you show me the contents of the paper? I am sure to list the first few articles in the journal." Woods asked, after all, Lucien's thesis Only after submitting the review, such a request is suspected of being unscrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not refuse, took a spare document from the storage bag and handed it to Woods: "It doesn't matter, I submitted it to the Arcane Review Committee for review." I also gave the 'Project Brief' as a discussion need, and everyone will see it tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods took the paper and looked carefully and seriously. Although Lucien? Evans is just a newcomer who has just been in contact with Arcane for a few months, but his only two papers have received attention. In particular, the second one has set off a violent wave in the field of elemental magic, which is extremely important. Can't ignore his paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plants seem to be able to absorb only those elements from substances that can dissolve in water?" Because the author of the paper is in front of him, Woods looks at both side and Lucy. En discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no divergent ideas, and he is very convinced: "From the experimental results, this is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Woods drank the lipstick tea, slowly turned to the next page, continued to discuss with Lucien, and appreciated the control experiment designed by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say a word to me, Woods sees the last part of the paper: a discussion of the large-scale preparation of several alchemy materials. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first experiment to treat phosphate rock with sulfuric acid to turn the alchemy material turned over, Woods took the black tea and took a sip, ready to discuss with Lucien The magical array design of scale preparation, but this time, his eyes suddenly reached the title of this page: "Experiment and discussion of synthetic urea." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗, the black tea in the mouth of Woods squirted out, sprayed a mist in front of him, and even Lucien sitting on his right hand was affected a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien rubbed his face very eagerly and asked: "Mr. Woods, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Evans, do you know what you are writing?!" Woods looked at Lucian with a horrified look, then bowed his head and quickly read the content behind him, looking at the experimental design and results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really synthesized with several inanimate gases?" Woods whispered in disbelief, fortunately he was not the magic of the Necromancer The teacher, after calming his emotions, stared solemnly at Lucien. "Evans, is this experiment done by your own hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien "The answer is: "Yeah, I used the magical array of the laboratory and the alchemy array. Mr. Woods, what's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you Do not understand the significance of this experiment and the serious problems that will surely cause?!" Woods could not help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head in an "innocent" way: "I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"XXXX How is it again?" Woods squashed again, holding his forehead in his right hand, seemingly calming his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After a morning investigation, in addition to confirming that the attacker is Traquill, there is no other harvest, such as Ravendi and Gaston, etc. I returned to my study, and several of them tried to narrow down the scope and get apocalypse with astrology. The result was disturbed and there was no clear result. I could only wait until the afternoon to ask the legendary magicians to use astrology and "backtracking" magic. Find clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gaston, this is a paper that needs to be reviewed today." Elemental servant took three papers and placed them on the desk in front of Gaston. The rest of the papers have been transferred to the middle-level arcian who is currently in the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
