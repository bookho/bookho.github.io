			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Magic Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon looked at the white solid red particles in the reaction furnace, and released the identification technique with a dignified expression. After the results were returned, the dark yellow eccentric pupil It is a subconscious contraction: "It's really urea, it doesn't use a little life material..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been gazing at the urea granules for a long time, and Gaston’s mouth gradually cocked. Exciting and ironic smile: "The guy who played with the corpse of the pale hand encountered a big event this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of different ideas, interests The struggle and the friction and disharmony in the darkness of the elemental will and the pale hand have existed for a long time. As a member of the will of the element, Gaston is a high-ranking magician who has been in the dark and the pale hand. He has seen many times when he sees human life mechanics. He is of course very schadenfreaked, anyway, his meditation environment and human body. The theory of life mechanics says that the relationship is extremely small, and the slight adjustment is that it has no effect at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Evans is actually mixing such an important experiment in this paper... He really does not know the theory of human life mechanics, or Do the temptation? The former may have a relatively large surname, and only if it is completely unaffected by the theory of human life mechanics, can it get rid of the shackles of past cognition, and synthesize urea so quickly.” Gaston has no doubt about Lucian’s arcane talent. With rigorous thinking skills, bold assumptions and a spirit of careful verification, there is now more ability to experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing the reaction furnace, Gaston is about to step out of the magic laboratory, with a bang, his door is knocked open, one placed on top A magical array is completely broken silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?!" Gaston asked with a woke, a spherical shield shining seven colors of light instantly appeared around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven-ring magic "spell reversal enchantment". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unanswered voice is accompanied by another loud bang, the magic lab’s door and all the magical arrays are all knocked and they are excited. The magic light hits the incoming person, but is absorbed by his nine-ring "absorbing magic" effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gasdon, have you seen this paper from Evans? The last part, the experiment of synthetic urea!" Lavin's obvious excitement The sound is heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaston looked at him slyly, then sighed: "Mr. Raven, please knock on the door first."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I am so excited, this is a masterpiece that can overthrow the body mechanics of the Necromancer! Have you seen it?!" Lavin’s voice was not degraded, and he saw the reaction. Furnace, I saw Gaston receiving the urea in the magic tube. "You also completed this experiment?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon looks after Lavin I made a gesture of pressing down and let Lavin pay attention to controlling the volume: "Yes, Mr. Lavindi, I have verified the experiment designed by Evans, synthesizing urea with non-living gas, but I think the name is decided. Not enough, urea may not be recognized as a living substance by the pale hands. Right, Mr. Ravendi, you haven't read this paper to others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No." Although Raven's surname is directly violent, but he can become a nine-level arcane master, certainly not an idiot, he will understand the addition of thinking The meaning of the East, "Do you want to take the gang of the Necromancer first, and then decide to surname the results and then throw the paper together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon seriously Nodded in the spot: "Mr. Ravendi, you see the words "elements" and "alchemy" on the surface of the paper, which proves that when Ivans assigned the paper, because Evans put this experiment in elemental research and alchemy reaction, it was I don't think it has anything to do with the Necromancer. That is to say, the Necromancer does not know this experiment, but Evans, I am worried that he revealed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can use this kind of bright research results to smash a pale hand, Gaston is very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't recognize Gaston's opinion." Lavin shook his head seriously. "This subversive research is different from the unique magic, no matter what. Whether or not you have a deciding name should be announced at the first time, so that all the arcans can see and discuss, in order to find the direction of the breakthrough and the method of synthesizing the material of the surname in the shortest time, bringing new development of arcane research. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaston thought for a moment: "Okay. But this will lead to extensive discussions. I am a bit worried about the safety of Evans.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven The first is the vice president of the will of the element, and the direct publication of urea's artificial synthesis is equally impactful, so Gaston did not insist.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Evans live The house between us is coming. "Raven did not hesitate to answer," but before that, I first went to several big druids to verify the correct surname in the front part of the Evans paper, so that they could see the possibility of popularizing food production. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Evans, do you now understand the importance of human life mechanics in the Necromancer? Woods spent more than ten minutes explaining the theory of human life mechanics.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face with a blank expression: "Understood, this is the vitality of the human body." It is said that it has such an important position in the Necromancer magic. I specialize in elements and astrology, and I don't really understand this. However, Mr. Woods, what does this have to do with my synthetic urea experiment? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Woods reluctantly confirmed that Lucien was a rookie who had learned the ancient magic and then studied alone and then contacted Arcane for only a few months. And the Wizards, a lot of common sense is lacking, "Urea is the material of life. Well, it should be said that most people regard urea as a living substance, which is not strictly defined. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien half jokingly said: "Mr. Woods, does this mean that my paper overturns the theory of human life mechanics and will get extremely high evaluation results?" Will there be a chance to win the Immortal Throne Award? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to say because it's not enough to decide the last name. Woods frowned. Even though he did not use the theory of human life mechanics to construct a world of understanding, the influence of many years has led him to subconsciously bias this theory and assess the status of urea with a critical eye. "As for the immortal throne award, I am afraid there is no hope. However, after the briefing tomorrow, Evans should pay attention to safety. It is not ruled out that some stubborn and unrelenting necromancers will lose your mind and want to teach you a meal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has prepared for this: "I will be injured in this estate in the past few days, there are Lavindi and Mr. Gaston, safe." It should not be a problem. Mr. Woods, are you willing to publish this paper? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I will be in the first issue of the next issue of the Ordinary Arcanist Monthly, and I think that the briefing after tomorrow will be full of experiments for you." Controversy, you can select valuable parts to be included in the journal. "Woods is keenly planning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Raven's voice came from outside the door: "Evans, are you there?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the end, Mr. Ravendi, how come you? "Lu Sien thought of the pile of mathematical exercises that had not been done, and opened the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven was still wearing the favorite gray. The magic robe, but the symbol above is already arranged according to the periodic table of elements: "I and Garthon have reviewed your paper and submitted the results to the Arcane Review Board. This is the final assessment handed over to you. By the way, you moved to my next room these few days. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Mr. Lavindi. Lu Xi'en could not ask for it. He agreed to it without a resignation and took the assessment results of the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This paper is a good solution to the alchemy material. Provide nutrients for plant growth, and design several large-scale preparation programs with certain important surnames and popular surnames. The artificial urea experiments in these preparation experiments are exciting to see the possibility of overthrowing human life mechanics. Although the definition of urea is still very confusing and cannot be provided as evidence for determining the surname, there is no doubt that this is a feat of creating a surname, and it has launched a powerful challenge to another basic theory of ancient magic. The comprehensive evaluation results are: rewarding 50 arcane points and 300 arcane points. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your three papers have such high ratings." "Woods sighed in the air after reading it. His arcade masters who are close to five grades have only a few papers on the creation of surnames and extremely valuable surnames, and the three papers published by Lucien." More or less accounted for one of the aspects, how can it not make people feel a little bit sour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sighing, Woods asked: "Mr. Ravendi, Will this research project continue? I listen to what you mean, how long do I have to stay here? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
