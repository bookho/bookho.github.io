			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bathing through the lunar glow of the lush foliage, Lucien turned into a shadow, carefully galloping in the slightly dark Melzer forest, The route chosen is the place where the ordinary adventurers often appear in the deep boundary between the periphery and the powerful dark creatures. On the way, you can see the weak goblin tribes around the campfire, the simple camp, and the fierce wolves and black bears. biological. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home of Felice is opposite to the location of the "Larnaca Canyon" and "Marsal River". The distance is far, but Lucien stimulates the blood. After that, the speed is amazing, and the endurance is not bad. After more than 20 minutes, I have already seen a layer of moonlight gently fluctuating, the beautiful and beautiful Marsol River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien stopped and became more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Outside the east entrance of the "Larnaca" canyon is the "Marsal River" that flows through it. It goes all the way east and finally flows in. "Belem River", so here is a river beach, beautiful river pebbles everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Black Forest, a black figure came out, he was tall, and the hood of the head covered his face in a fuzzy shadow, squatting on his shoulders. A strange bird with bright red skin but no feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#;&#;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked slowly step by step, his heart filled with embarrassment, but did not dare to look back, because the night watchman "clown" feared to concentrate ambush too early It will let the "professor" of the cockroache find the problem, no longer appear, so hide far away, waiting for the signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that after this success, I will be able to get the 'Magic Gate' potion from the referee, become a formal magician, then join the vigil, no longer do this A spy who is very dangerous and safe and has no security."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wolf can not help but speed up even if he keeps his spells focused. In the past, he has been afraid of fear. The exposure of identity will be jointly killed by the magicians to death, and now, it is necessary to directly face a powerful magician who is at least three rings, although the night watchman captain is very fast, from the hiding place to the most Thirty seconds, but this thirty seconds, can you stop the professor's attack? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the fire wolf touched his bracelet, this is a three-level magic item of the church reward "the bracelet of the weaver", himself Only rely on it, only hope to drag the professor for thirty seconds and save the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time it is already 10:40, the fire wolf went to the entrance of the canyon, the "professor" has not yet appeared, and the nearby is quiet only the roar of the distant beast The sound came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstable for a while, seeing that the professor still did not come, the fire wolf looked around and suddenly saw a boulder flashing in the canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the casting material, the fire wolf walked cautiously and saw a line of green fluorescent powder on the boulder:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change the location, see the black forest in the south of the canyon..." followed by the corresponding constellation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the fire wolf is not good at astrology magic, but based on the clear constellation standard calculation position is still barely can be done, and quickly calculated the specific location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wolf is not surprised by the "professor" temporary change, which is a common means of preventing being tracked and monitored. If you don't do this when you meet a stranger with a stranger, the fire wolf will feel that this is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the magic pet "Firebird" to sound normal to the number of tweets to inform the change of the night watchman captain, the fire wolf went to the Black Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor" gave this place a long time. After more than ten minutes, the wolf came to the designated position, surrounded by tall black cedar trees. , completely cover the moonlight, a complete darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the other direction of the Black Forest, there are several beasts screaming, making people creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these screams make the fire wolves feel a little relieved, because they are signals that the night watchman has tracked and hid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, but the professor still did not appear. The fire wolf gradually became irritable and walked back and forth in the same place: "Does the professor find the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 11:30, half an hour has passed since the agreed time, and there is no movement in the dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman who was ambushing in the distance slowly lost patience and thought that the professor might have noticed something wrong, so he wore black leather armor and black gloves. A night watchman captain in the clown mask commanded the hidden companion in a unique way: "With the position of the wolf as the center, everyone searches for the nearby 500 meters of the Black Forest. The professor has either found an abnormal departure or is still hiding. Within this distance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman "Clown" has to make the final effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman in the white dress, Minsk, etc. immediately acted, sneaked into the darkness and searched around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking for a hundred meters to the Black Forest in the west of the "Fire Wolf", the red-haired Minsk found an ordinary forester’s cabin, inside No light shines, dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the forest on the other side of the Ranger’s cabin, a night watchman has quietly fell to the ground, full of horror and fear, mooring The boiled blood mixed with white brain juice flowed out from the hole in the head, penetrated into the black land, and moistened them more fertile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to the dead vigil, stood a tall, thin man wearing a black trench coat painted with silvery white horns. The feeling of horror is to spread the right index finger of the brain with his head into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few breaths, the tall and thin man puzzled the crystal ball on his left hand: "Hello priest, they are coming to hunt down a magic." The teacher’s should just happen to happen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So coincidentally? And they searched like this, and soon the entrance to the ruins will be discovered, so Dragan, Cooperate with other Knights of the Temple to kill them all, anyway, you can push them to the ambush of the magician." The crystal ball has an old and decaying sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the silver-white horn hides here, it will certainly closely monitor the nearby area, so after the fire wolf comes over, it will soon be discovered by the priests, and then the night watchman Checking the ambush and searching for "professor" actions, and exposing their traces to the eyes of the cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All as you wish, Lord High Priest. Oh, killing is like dancing, I like this feeling." Dragan also allowed a finger The black windbreaker floated back and the whole person directly integrated into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "night killer" Dragan and other dark knights, there is no way to figure out who the enemy is and the current situation of the night watchman is a Then one was silently strangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............because of the suspicion that "Professor" knows that there are spies in the magic circle, this time it is a trap that he deliberately arranged, so in order to catch at least three rings The magician "professor" and his possible helper, the referee is the whole two night watchman squad, a total of 30 official pastors, the strength of the knight's strength, there are even four captains and vice-captains of the big knight level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the high-level power being dragged down by Camille’s “great conspiracy” message, this is already nearly half the strength of the Vaolirit diocese, because of this There are only five teams full of night watchers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the intelligence and judgment of the church, no matter what ambush the "professor" has, what traps are there, so that the strength of the night watchman team can be directly solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every such night watchman is a strong man who has experienced many battles in the dark, so after the first seven or eight night watchmen died silently, The rest of the night watchers were aware of the wrong atmosphere, and the forest seemed to be floating with blood and death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, the night watchman "Clown" began to try to contact the team members, but he just showed a unique method, and immediately felt a wrong feeling in his heart, so Do not hesitate, regardless of any image, roll forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of darkness flew out of the forest and hit the place where the clown was originally hidden. The dirt, stones, grass, and trees disappeared without a trace. It seems to evaporate from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who was pulled out was the "night killer" Dragan. He didn't panic, continued deep darkening, tried to get rid of an invisible thin line, and he looked at the "clown" and sneered: "The original It’s your '傀儡' bloody guy who has left the darkness and become the running dog of the referee.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m the Lord’s gift of the bloodline’ It's totally different from Dragan's 'Dark Blood'." The clown also recognized Dragan, but the funny clown smile mask completely covered all his expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown continues to sway the other’s hands and feet, while inspiring the talisman, a ray of light flies up and goes towards the air, bursting into the sacred emblem of truth. Look like a high-level rescue to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, an obvious black ripple rushed from the direction of the forester’s hut, hitting the light and letting it disappear without exploding . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-level sorcerer (genuine) "magic swallow", this is a strong cardinal level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the underground ruins, five people wearing silver priest robes are watching the two high priests in the middle of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the old men with a bald head and a lot of mysterious symbols, said in an old, decaying voice: "You are all priests who receive the gift of true God, now It is time for you to show your devotion to the true God, to lead the priests to go out, and to cooperate with the knight to destroy all the running dogs of these evil spirits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another high priest, the whole The man was covered in silver robes, and it was cold and cold like a cold winter voice: "Although the signal of their help was intercepted by me, except for the people in the nearby Black Forest, they could not be seen anywhere else. The reinforcements of the evil spirits come, but the time is precious. In order to prevent accidents, you should solve them as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your will is the will of God, the high priest of respect. The five priests answered at the same time, and then went out of the temple, with the priests, and a small number of reserve knights and knights to go to the exit of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two high priests stayed in the temple, on the one hand to stop the night watchman’s help, and on the other hand to prevent other powerful enemies that might appear. It is convenient to make decisions in a timely manner. After all, things are always a coincidence and a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who watch the night, with their own strengths, have a great grasp, if they run away, the dark forest will be the paradise of the Dark Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Although the clown’s request for help was intercepted, it was enough to make other night watchmen and wolves in the surrounding Black Forest identify abnormalities, so the Dark Knights The strangulation began to be difficult, and the vigils gathered in the direction of the clown, that is, the forester's hut slowly gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night watchman wearing a white bishop’s robe, holding a thick “sacred code” in his hands, strolling in the Black Forest, with “ The sacred sacred, a huge flame-like light descended from the sky, hit a dark knight, let him fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four-level magical "flame strike". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more frightening is that the night watchman has just applied "flame strike" without any cushioning, and with the "the Holy Scriptures" flipping again, A blazing fire wall appeared in front, helping the two night watchers to withstand the attack of the Dark Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is another captain of the night watchman, the five-level bishop-level powerhouse, willing to give up the bright and bright life in the sun, for the sake of truth. The glory of God is an endless fight in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other places, the night watchman who reacted also started the battle with the dark knights, a burst of sound, a glimmer of light, so quiet sitting far away Lucien on the treetop can judge the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien swings with the treetops swaying in the night wind, and there is no idea of ​​approaching the forester’s cabin for the time being, this time close, only let yourself roll Into the chaotic battle, you must wait patiently for a while. So Lucien held the branches with his hands, like a leisurely watch of the "fireworks." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Minsk relied on the powerful defenses of the "Red Dragon Scale" to withstand the first wave of assassination of the Dark Knight, after a difficult support He finally waited for the "clown", "holding" and other people to come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
