			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abyss gap is in the northeast direction of Stroop Forest, away from the "natural residence", plus the spatial disorder caused by the instability of the gap, so Lucien Others did not risk sending the past, but flying in the air. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dark green forest below, listening to the sound of birds singing, Natasha suddenly heard the soul of the musician: "What is nature?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to know from the various historical documents and classics that the elf will become a big tree after death. It is another matter to witness it. So she sighed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, what is nature?" When Lucien repeated, his eyes had already looked at Malfurion and Rachel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is nature? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario and others heard this question and suddenly did not know how to answer. Every elf and every Druid has his own natural The definition, whether it is hatred or balance, is self-proclaimed as the guardian of nature, and because the definition and viewpoint of nature are different, the "natural heart" formed by the druids is not exactly the same. The magic of the gods has a certain degree of difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is the world, including plants, animals, humans, elves, etc. that represent vitality, including volcanoes, swamps, poisonous fogs, and then these series of things have formed. The interlocking balance system is interdependent and mutually restrictive. Once it loses its balance, it will naturally go to the run-down and go to destruction, becoming a ridiculous place without life.” Malfurion took a moment to say it, or said that he Natural understanding, balance and life are the core of his understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lahill has some of the arrogance of the elves, although not natural hate, but also does not like to discuss this issue with humans, just stressed: "Nature Life must be included, otherwise the desert of life can't be called natural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante smiled with his eyes closed: "The gap in the abyss is coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four are legendary, even if they deliberately slow down the flight speed, avoid danger, and it doesn't take long to reach the abyss gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the forest, the dust of the blood-colored dust shrouded a large area, and the center could see a big gap like a dragonfly. Through this The gap, the bloody plain on the opposite side of the pit, is faintly exposed, and the rich bloody smell and killing atmosphere pervade it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the dust, a still prosperous town stands on the edge of the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown Town"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long history of the stability of the abyss, the name is killing and chaotic The demons continue to impact the gap, impacting the seals and defenses of the elves, trying to truly fall into the material world of the Lord, turning this into a land of destruction and disorder similar to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For human adventurers, the demons are horrible, but all parts of their bodies are precious materials. It is very good to capture demons without entering the abyss. Choice, so an adventurer gathered here, with the prototype of the original town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, the great knights and the knights found that this is a perfect battlefield for tempering themselves, so they often come a long way to come and practice - for high-ranking knights Say, unless the blood is really top-notch and talented, you can only rely on battle to find the opportunity to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a relatively stable situation on the mainland, it is too dangerous to go to the dark mountains, dragons and swamps, and accidentally hit the ninth level. Magical creatures, and the gaps in Stroop Forest limit the power of the invading demons, so that the high-ranking knights do not have to worry about encountering the demon king, the duke, etc., and peacefully fighting the same level, so the town is more and more prosperous, It is one of the places where the density of high-ranking strongmen is very high, and it is only inferior to places such as Lance, Allinge, and Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the same level of battle is certainly not without danger, a bit of a knight, a high-level magician sent his surname here, and high-order The following adventures are often dead and injured, so the town is named "Unknown":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dragon of the Green" Mason looked at the "Unknown Town" and stood on the wooden sign for hundreds of years. He once again sighed and sighed back and forth, looking at the sky with the bloody dust covering the sun: "When can I leave?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves who guard the gaps have always been indifferent to the adventurers, but their actions have indeed eased their busyness, no longer have to sneak over The devils in the gaps are troubled, so they have a blind eye to the existence of the town of the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young brown-haired man next to Mason took out a special cigar from the Kingdom of Burriana. After igniting, he took a deep breath and squinted, then Spit out the white eye circles: "Big brother, don't worry, the elves won't let us leave until the inexplicable problem is solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel my The lungs are full of sand and blood.” Mason took over the cigar of his friend, Fred, and used tobacco to ease his mood. “You know, I promised to return with my family for half a year before I came out. It’s been more than two weeks now. They are looking for it and will be hurt by this 'mad' place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid spit a smoke ring and smiled bitterly: "I knew early to leave early." The elves are afraid that the news of the abyss gap will be leaked to the seas, so we will limit our ability to enter and leave, unless they can find a solution, or the sea has already heard from other channels, otherwise we can only continue to Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "If the abyss gap is out of control again..." As a six-level knight, Mason couldn't help but fear when he thought of the situation at that time. It was like a demon army of tides, the demon king and duke of horror. It is a nightmare that he will never forget. I don’t know how many adventurers have provoked a little embarrassment and died under the attack of the devil. If it was not the time to guard the "night wizard" Malfurion, he waited for the day knight. I am afraid that there will be several fallen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Mason’s words, Ferred couldn’t help but shudder, remembering the two bloody, red-scaled “bloody kings”, remembering Its golden cold pupil: "I hope the elves will ask for reinforcements as soon as possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf is a proud race, not really unable to handle it by itself. I will never take the initiative to ask for help." Mason usually admire the arrogance of the elves, but this time it is particularly hateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he recovered his eyes and burned most of his cigars on his hands: "The town seems to be a bit wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid’s eyes twitched slightly: “Well, some weird...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, Natasha, Malfurion lowered their height and moved closer to the abyss gap. At this time, a dark green and a brown figure flew from below and stopped. In front of four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three distinguished guests, thank you for coming to help." The brown figure is a tall, middle-aged human man holding a carved in his hand. The wooden stick that balances the sign is the "hand of balance" Lodell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this height, the abyss behind the gap is very clear, it is a plain that is stained with blood, but there are strange white stones everywhere. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plains, except for a few plants covered with scales, only the bloody soil and gravel, when blown by the wind, raised the dust of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the sky, where the dust was obscured, Lucien saw a pale sun, under the blood, with a strange blush . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is so bleak and bloody, full of mood-lower shades, seemingly proclaiming killing and destruction anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder." The dark green figure is a head-sized pocket lady with dark green hair, beautiful facial features, slender figure, fingers The end is faintly revealing the green color, with a pair of transparent flaps on the back, surrounded by a rich forest atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a tree fairy, "The Guardian of the Green", Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After greeting Malfurion, Celine did not speak again. For the tree fairy, the humans who destroy the forest are unforgivable villains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
