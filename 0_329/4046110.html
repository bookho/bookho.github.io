			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool breeze from the living room in the early spring night, Lilith and Sarah couldn’t help but shudder, maybe because the sky was dark and dark, the manor The environment is quiet and deep, and the young man in front of him is calm and restrained. They always have a feeling of darkness and darkness here, as if they had heard the stories of the dark mountains or the depths of the Black Forest when their parents told stories about their stories. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lilith and Sarah soon returned to their hearts and laughed at themselves: "A talented musical genius, a pure and beautiful piano piece The musicians, as well as the official music consultant of His Royal Highness, how could it be Dongzhi (Tibetan-Province), a low-key life magician? We are really too cranky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the Lopez butler came with a few servants holding a copper candlestick, and the swaying candlelight immediately brightened the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked down the stairs and calmly smiled at Sarah and Lilith: "Two guests, you are visiting because of a historical document that allows me to interpret ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is warm and peaceful, and Lilith’s ear is introduced, so that she can completely get rid of the illusion just now, her cheeks are red, excited and a bit stuttering: "Ivan Mr. Evans, I really like your music very much, whether it is "Destiny" or the serenade in G major, and the favorite is "Dedicated to Silvia", so the simple and beautiful melody is deeply I hit my heart and can see you, I am very happy, very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even organized the language to be confused, but still barely expressed His own meaning, his eyes filled with admiration and worship, Mr. Evans is more temperament than he imagined, and it is also beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, I also like your music." Sarah is not as excited as her sister, but she can’t help but express her love, in a repressed magical life. Here, the melody of fate is that he sang over and over again, thank Lucien? Evans wrote this inspiring piece of music, thanking the fat-headed baron for asking the band to come to the town for a big price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Thank you for your kindness, but I think we should still discuss the manuscript."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician who believes that "knowledge is equal to power", Lucien has a strong interest in historical documents, and perhaps contains the knowledge or information he needs, so Reception of Sarah and Lilith, after all, with the "Aalto Music Festival" is about to begin, this time every day, people come to visit, Lu Xien used the peace of mind to prepare for the concert to be pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Evans, we are dying." Sarah calmed down and took a stack of old white paper from her arms and handed it to Lucien. "This is the document, please also read it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the paper: "It doesn't matter, you really like what I can understand, can It’s a great honor to understand. Sit down, let’s discuss together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith blushes and sat down with Sarah, sneaking up to the opposite side On the sofa, Lucien was engrossed in the look of the manuscript. The deep side, the beautiful outline, and the unique temperament made her like it very much. She was ashamed to think: "Mr. Evans is more attractive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to quickly read through, so that the soul library first recorded Lu Xien this time is no exception, can be swayed, suddenly saw a familiar text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the sun enters the palace of Thanos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Lucien’s expression became slightly dignified: “Why did you see a similar sentence for the second time in just a few months? What does the relationship between Mr. Drony’s poetry and this manuscript?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such doubts, after the soul library recorded, Lucien looked very serious, less than ten pages of manuscripts for half an hour, the more The more I watched, the more I was shocked, because I compared some of the remote documents I had seen. The incomplete and unclear manuscript seemed to be telling a magical relic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly added the background and historical events, and interpreted the manuscript without any texts. The surface was dedicated and dignified, but The heart is a huge wave:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien turned the book of Astrology and Elements to the corresponding unique magical array. After careful comparison before and after, it was finally determined that the scene described in one paragraph of this document was a magical lock based on astrology. Cross star frame." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lock" is a powerful magic enchantment that covers a wide range and can run automatically for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Drony's poetry describes the scene when the 'Elsino' lake appeared, and this document seems to be the same, not only with more specific meteorites. Destroy the city, the description of the strange red liquid, and the follow-up of the magnificent architecture and magical locks. But this manuscript is too much, why is it a magical building on the ground, why is there no connection? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ancestor of the witch is Aalto's magician. Although there is no record, it can be guessed that his teacher, who has a 'prophet' The legendary magician of the title should be the magic lord of the nearby country. Since the lock is in the same content as his magic book in his territory, the underground magical building is probably the one he is responsible for. Unfortunately, the book of the stars and elements. It’s a magic book, and the contents of no notes are on it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless thoughts flashing in the heart, Lucian looked up and said calmly: “This manuscript is very broken. , there are no other The more information, the easier it is to interpret, and from the paper feel, this is the paper after the invention of the new papermaking, unlike the grass paper or parchment literature in the dark ages."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The literature we got was not the original manuscript, only so much." Although facing the musician Lucy, who likes and admires it very much. Evans, but Lilith responded with vigilance, and Sarah nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien compares poetry, literature, and the magical lock arrangement on the book "Astrology and Elements" and discovers that he can basically find out according to the terrain and the stars. Wait for the location of the "lock", because all "locked" operations rely on similar things, but the structure of each lock is different, it is difficult for people who don't understand the lock to calculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will be able to read the part that I can read." Lucien told the judgment of "Elsino" Lake one by one, It is obvious that Sarah and Lilith’s eyes are brighter and the expression becomes more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lu Xien finished reading the contents of the hand-written documents, Lilith couldn’t hide her delight: "I’m so grateful to you, Mr. Evans, you The interpretation is really useful for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough." Sarah was first pleased, then wake up, and quickly coughed to stop her sister's excitement, "Thank you very much. Mr. Evans, your interpretation, don't know how much we need to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xiping laughed and said: "A Jintal." Knowledge can't The sale, especially after preparing the music festival, excuses the wind and invites to leave Aalto. The money is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; served as a music consultant for Natasha for nearly six months, plus the remaining cash in the estate, Lucien currently has a total of thirty Jintales, many The wealth that civilians can accumulate in their lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the value of a few thousand Jintale manor, Lucian is no way to sell, which makes him a bit of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your knowledge far exceeds the value of Quintal." Sara took out her purse and respectfully gave Lucien a Quintal. He didn't hesitate, didn't have heartache, even if he followed the scholars to learn words and professional knowledge, he only had five to twenty Yinar in a month, but the value of this document is not what Kintal can measure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and pointed to the darkness outside: "The gate has been closed. If the two don't give up, why not stay in my manor for one night? My Although the chef is not as good as the court chef, his fried veal has also been praised by His Royal Highness Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Thank you, Mr. Evans "You are such a kind person." Lilith found that the objects she worshiped more and more in line with her own expectations and became more like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed the butler Lopez to go to the room with Sarah and Lily Ribbon, Lucien quietly stood in the living room watching them leave, the black shadow was shaking The candlelight is like a ghost twist:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was too coincidental to hear poetry from Mr. Drony, and someone came to the door in a few months. Request to interpret the literature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
