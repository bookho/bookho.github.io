			<div id="content">-- Seeking a referral on Monday, I want to push the list last week! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde is like a coveted old man, his eyes are dim and turbid, his reaction to things seems to be slow, or with kindness and jealousy. The smile, turning a blind eye to the disparity of Grand Duke of Ouette and Natasha: "A few months ago, because of the revelation and accurate intelligence of the Lord, the night watchman of the referee traced to a magic parliamentary congregation hidden in Aalto. Although the Magic Council often has a magician who goes through Alto to the last remnant of the magical empire deep in the Dark Mountains, few people dare to stay in Aalto and try to contact the ancient magical inheritors here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they just want to bring Aalto's ancient magical inheritors to the Magic Council, they have been doing this for over two hundred years, each adding a magician According to the current structure of the Magic Council, you can add a lot of power, unless that magic The teacher doesn't want to grow any more.” As a devout believer, Mr. Vaoliit seems to be afraid of disgusting attitudes when the magician does not seem to be mentioned by ordinary people. Perhaps it is because he has seen a lot and has a complete understanding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three most authoritative people in the Principality of the first row of the box in the first row of the Salde, Waorit, Natasha talk about this matter At that time, the earliest counties and countess were listening carefully, and the expressions were equally eccentric, as if they had thought of any rumors, but they did not interject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the point of view of his contacts in Aalto, there are indeed other plots. Unfortunately, the night watchman failed to capture him and let him destroy himself." Thrall did not answer, but looked at the tall paladin who was wearing a full armor and could not see his face, and he explained to the Grand Duke of Vaolirit and Princess Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We suspect that the 'professor' of this mysterious magician should come for the same plot, and also shoulder the responsibility of the death of the magician before the investigation, so It can be judged that he was to Aalto after the witch was burned to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the knight of the church can be called a paladin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, although her expression was a little weird before, but she was relaxed on the back of the chair, she was always relaxed, looking at the eyes with a smile The seat of ordinary nobles and musicians: "Your mastery of the Aalto magic circle seems to be very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Natasha’s piety to the god of truth It was praised by Cardinal Serge, and her teacher was the head of the Church of the Knights of the Sword, but in addition to praying and facing the god of truth, even in front of the cardinal and the Grand Duke, she was such a deputy Lazy look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although he deliberately disguised the knowledge of magic, the current magic system is different from the ancient magic system, which makes his cover some failures, but I can see that the professor Mr. does not trust Aalto's magicians, I think he probably suspected that the magician was rounded up because he had contacted Aalto's magic circle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tall paladin said the judgment inside the church, "And the two hidden people in the magic circle of Aalto, because of that matter, are also suspected by others, it is difficult to track 'professor', and Before the exact message of 'Professor', the night watchers did not dare to approach their secret gatherings, lest they be trapped, and I am afraid that they could not be arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This church is a powerful city. After centuries of ancient magical inheritors, some people were secretly included in the church. Some people have been caught by the church and changed their camps. But the church has not attacked Aalto again and again. Magician Mofaxuetu who will be emptied completely exposed part, because their strength has been insufficient to set off a big storm in Alto, but rather retain the integrity of this magic circle, you might catch big fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Ouerite touched his thin chin: "The professor's business is not in a hurry. The most important thing is the movement of the 'white horn'. And what exactly is their plot in Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish, Grand Duke." The Paladin himself made this decision because of magic. There is only a non-powerful magician in the parliament. There will not be too much conspiracy for the time being. "The 'professor' has been handed over to the primary vigil, and we are going to trace the 'silver-white corner'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha played with her purple hair to the waist and asked casually: "I haven't found Longsang? Aaron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, at the door of the box, a young purple-haired man who was half a head taller than Natasha came in. His appearance was similar to that of Natasha, but it was harder and more stable. The simple knight suit had only violets. Family crest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and gave a gesture to the Earl of Hain, Count Lafayette, and finally went to the first row, respectfully speaking to Sarde and Vaoli. Extraordinary public salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear cousin, you are late." Natasha shook her hand with a smile, this is the highest rank of the City Guard, Count Verdi. The nephew of Grand Duke of Ouol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Verdi finished the Knights ceremony, he sat next to Natasha, only between the two middle-aged women: "Before you come over Some of the news that the City Guard got about the Silver Point, but unfortunately did not have much to gain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While explaining, he picked up the music list: "Lu Xien Evans, who is this composer? When did he write this symphony called 'Destiny'?" Earl Verdi, who is famous for his music, is familiar with the musicians association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he said this, both the Grand Duke of Vaolirit and the Bishop of Sald took a look at the music list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The symphony of the theme of 'destiny'? It seems to be a composer who is brave to try." Bishop Sald said slyly, There is no such thing as a music trend in Aalto. Strength is the confidence of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variot’s grandfather put down the music list: “But why haven’t I heard of this musician? And what is his relationship with Victor?” as a Music lovers, Aalto's famous musicians who are qualified to perform concerts in the Hall of the Holy Land, are very familiar with Grand Duke Oa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed: "The Baron Othello asked me to change the track temporarily, and kept the music and composer secret, hey, but this road Sean Evans, I know, he is a student of Victor, a guy who only started his music career for three months. What kind of music can he write? In addition to courage, other guys who look like women are weak. What kind of music can I write? I really look forward to it." As a five-level knight, she is very good both in listening and memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three months? Although I started learning music at the age of eight, I was able to write a score at the age of nine, but I have to say that this is really amazing and unbelievable. "Will's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, he is the kind of thing that must do the best, can not tolerate the powerful man beyond others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde is still so calm: "There are always some people who are the geniuses of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hearing this sentence, Natasha could not help but think of all kinds of rumors about Bishop Sarder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting into the Aalto Abbey, Thrad is very mediocre, far less than the talented geniuses, but in the end, become the Holy Spirit The priest was him, although it took a full 150 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often cautions the latecomer as: "The piety of the Lord has nothing to do with talent and talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;So in the face of the so-called genius, Thrad is always so calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandfather Waorit looked back and looked at the aristocrats who were very surprised when they heard Natasha’s words, laughing: “Only hear the music. Can you be sure that it is true? The talent of music is something the devil can't give, but the lie is a symbol of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished, Victor Holding a baton, went to the stage, first salute the direction of the box where they were in the direction of the box, and then bowed to the nobles and musicians in other directions, and finally turned around, his head slightly lowered. Staring at the baton in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music began to sound, and the grandfather Waorit closed his eyes and listened, then smiled: "This is the highest level of Victor's work in the past, fully demonstrating the music. The beauty of the place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the beautiful music, the voice of all aristocratic communication slowly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the background, Lucien and Lott, Felice and others smiled and it seemed that Victor's mental state was very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
