			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you reviewed it yourself?" After a careful look, Fernando asked for a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucien not understand what he meant, he smiled and said: "Teacher, this paper does not have any subversion of the surname, just a supplementary paper for electronic discovery." As you know, I discovered through the flow of electrons that the vase contained a curse, so I used the research of the cathode ray method to verify the special material of the vase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Fernando took the paper and complained casually: "Every time you read your paper, you have to deal with the troubles behind you. Can't you write a regular paper normally?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fernando, as long as it is not a terror hypothesis of the level of "energy discontinuity", he is happy to see the general subversion of the surname, in order to advance the process of exploring the world, But if you need to subvert the surname, his eager surname will make him very headache. I really want Douglas to wait for Lucy's papers to communicate, and don't need to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a teacher who helped deal with the consequences of the possibility of exploding the head of the magician. Lucien was very happy and didn't want to take this trouble at all, so I heard Fernando at this time. After complaining, I smiled and did not make any arguments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking over, Fernando’s expression gradually became serious, and he read it carefully. After a long time, he only watched the little half and couldn’t help but shook his head: "Morris will definitely hate him. Why didn't he help him when he started Berak? "Afriest is trapped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper The title is "A new element that can radiate electrons and two other types of rays." In Fernando's view, the new element named "Uranium" by Lucian is not important. What is important is that its radiation confirms that electrons come from The atom, thus determining the atom's internal structure, illuminates a dark, microscopic world, which is enough to win the Holm Crown Award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, this is not the point." Lucian whispered a reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked up, the red eyes were sharp and abnormal, isn’t that the point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to electronics, I don’t know why special materials will radiate a new element." Lucien tried to make his language vague "wrong". Avoid revealing more content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A new element is radiated?" Fernando suspects that he has misunderstood that one element can radiate another element? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he read more and more seriously, looked at it, and the tone became harsh: "Is there any analysis of the composition of special materials, whether this new element itself Is it included in special materials?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Analysis, using 'same return' and other magical arrays to purify a small number of special elements, and found that it will still Radiation out of this new element, which I named '氦', although the purified material may still contain other undiscovered trace elements, but it can be determined that it does not contain this gas or its alchemicals." Lucien A few pages behind the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What secrets are there in the change of elements? Can they change each other?" Fernando fell into deep thought, waiting for a few minutes, his tone was as good as ever. "You are really shrouded in the goddess of fortune. You can get this special material even if you encounter assassination. I believe that in the end, this will definitely let us know the mysteries of the creation and emergence of elements, and the mystery of the birth of matter."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the tradition of the ancient magical empire, the parliament likes to virtualize the names of various goddesses to describe certain things, such as the essence of magic is called "magic goddess", the harshest cold It is called the "Goddess of Ice and Snow" and is completely different from the gods of different church beliefs such as the God of Truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, I don't want to submit this paper for the time being, I plan to seal it for a few years like a miracle experiment." Lucien made his own request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Fernando is not convinced that there is no paper that has a subversion of the surname, why not submit it without angering the magician and the church. It is not better to let more Arcane masters explore the microcosm and explore the material nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he looked at the last few pages, he saw Lucy’s curse magic idea based on the cursed ray and saw the suffocating heat on the ultra-low temperature. Contribute, I saw the two magical structures of "Evans's extremely cold rays" and "Ice and Snow Goddess". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Fernando's words, Affris looked at the paper with a burning look. He seemed to want to mention the feather pen and add his own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The principle behind the ice and snow magic is relatively simple, as long as the suffocation is discovered, someone will soon construct it, I want to be my own card." Lucien said Take your own reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled and shook his head: "This simple magic also wants to be kept secret? Hard, Lucien, don't forget Atlante I also took some of the materials, and another part is in the corrections department. Guess what time they can find out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In three or four years." Sean made his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando smiled: "The next five or six years is your time to concentrate on high-level, I don't agree that you often go out, so there is no magic as a card. It doesn't matter at all. Hey, the power of this magic is not small. It can make you have a turn to face in the face of high-level magicians. Even if you promote the six rings and seven rings, it is of great use. You kill Bellak. Is the extreme cold ray used? Is your cognitive world initially materialized?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the initial materialization when confirming that electrons are internal structures of atoms "Lu Xien can not mention that when the energy is not continuous, fortunately, the discovery of electrons, confirming the relationship between electrons and atoms is also a breakthrough in the minds of the arcaneists, bringing the initial essence of the cognitive world. It is possible, so Lucien once again said, "Thank you for your vase, Mr. Bellak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the storm dominated without doubt, nodded gently : "Then you have the possibility of raising the ranks in the next three or four years. If the material is not enough, I can go to my semi-level warehouse to find it. This paper can be temporarily sealed for two years, but I will inform Atlante, lest he should be willing to submit the paper, hey, two years later Ok, now, Morris will definitely use the excuse to discover the electronic and confirm that the electron belongs to the atomic internal structure is the same result before and after the stage, only to give you an 'electronic' ring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this paper should not be kept secret for a few years. It is said that both Timothy and Yurissie are studying the composition of the gas. It seems that there are already unrecognized gases in the air."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the storm dominates, Aphrodite’s eyes are brightened, and he looks at Lucien, who seems to want to marry the half-face warehouse he dominates the storm. Move it clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pretended not to see its gaze, although he was very greedy, but this kind of thing can not be greedy, if his wealth is enough, the parliament If you don't lack materials, it's best to rely on yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past few years, concentrate on improving the magic power." Fernando finally sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lentart, Nexel Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We must stop the conflict between the church and the Magic Council!" said the Duke of Bald, James. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holm Kingdom’s great aristocrats in Rentatt were summoned by King Fertis and King Patrick to discuss what happened today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker of the Aristocratic Parliament, Duke of Flensburg, looked at James coldly: "Stop? We strive to maintain balance and let the damn magicians Surviving, are they rewarding us with such things? I think it is a serious mistake to support them again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a white wig and shaved his beard Clean, the deep wrinkles in the corners of the eyes and the sharp blue eyes are in stark contrast, still as strong and powerful as his title "Wang Zhishi". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reopened aristocracy will not completely abandon the church, and the conservative aristocracy should also understand that without the magical parliament, there is no authority and status we have now." "The Duke of Wolfsburg, Russell, did not use vague words to slap the words, and directly put the facts that everyone knew but would not raise them on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the conservative and enlightened aristocrats stopped the quarrel and the palace was strange and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Russell, please pay attention to your words, our status and glory from the Lord's blessing, the lord's gift and their own efforts." Seeing King Fertisius's eyes slightly picked up, and the words broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
