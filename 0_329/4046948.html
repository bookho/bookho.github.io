			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Earl." A farmer who worked in the field humbly and courteously said hello to his lords, most of whom have not had time to look at it. Knowing the count of the Earl, only knowing that he can be surrounded by so many knights, can ride the dragon horse of the gods, can wear a collar over the back of the head, cover the gorgeous coat of the ear, here must be only the noble Earl, Moreover, the guys in front are not at the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Paphos has a pair of legs on his legs, holding a whip in his hand, and the farmer’s greetings are unheard of, this is what the nobles deserve. Treatment, do not need to be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left the manor to turn into the avenue, Count Peffes slammed his horse and let it run faster, surpassing a carriage along the road. One pedestrian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who ride the carriage, the Earl of Perfos is despised, how can the aristocrats who have been shackled by strangling the magician and all kinds of heretics give up The pride, the abandonment of the knight's instinct, vanity is also the original sin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pephos family was the first family of knights to follow the church and the king against the magical empire, and the title of the Earl was able to be tyrannical and established by generations. Immortal feats, including the Earl of Befors himself, he was promoted to the Knights when he was 40 years old, and he was awarded the title of "Guardian Dragon", with his hands covered with evil magicians and various heretical blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dozens of dragons and horses ran fast, all the way into the city, the gatekeeper of the gatekeeper saw the Pefus family’s logo and let it go. The road, I dare not intercept and check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus pulls the reins, and the dragon scales stand up, and the mouth screams like a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following knights made similar moves, stopping the horses at almost the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Earl adults." At the door of the villa, there are already two nobles dressed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wear the currently popular two-layer jacket, the numerous buttons are all made of gems, and the outside is covered with high-necked jackets, not many ornaments. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus turned over and bowed slightly: "Working hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is The two barons led by his count, today, helped him to convene a private gathering of the aristocrats who had come closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our pleasure." The two barons replied respectfully and led him to the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus is not scornful, but he is very satisfied with the attitude of the two barons, which allows him to feel the glory and authority of the superiors and nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several long tables in the villa hall, which are placed with steak, roast chicken, and fat food. There are already many nobles holding wine glasses, two or two Groups gather to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Countess." All the nobles greeted the Earl of Perfos at the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus raised his right hand and waved: "Everyone, good evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He enjoys such occasions, and the rights and places are always fascinating at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing the whip to the accompanying knight, Count Pefus is preparing to host the party, but at this time, the guardian of the goalkeeper introduces a sacred white The clergy of the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The honorary count, the bishop of the bishop asks you to go to church." Although the young clergyman is very polite, the face is tight and there is no A smile, giving people an unusually proud feeling, no one in the presence of the nobility feels wrong, this is the Lord's shepherd, even if he is dissatisfied with his attitude, there can be no indication, otherwise the night watchman of the referee will find Come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the tension?" Earl of Perfus asked awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude made the Earl of Perfus irritated, and the church's clerics did not even have the most basic courtesy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he controlled his emotions and said with no expression: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the count, already past six o'clock in the evening, no one can ride a horse except the knight who is on duty." The clergyman added succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus secretly clenched his fist and felt a raging anger, and as an lord, as the lord of the city, he even connected this No privilege? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the clerics finished the account, they painted a cross on the chest: "I hope that the Earl will arrive at the church as soon as possible, but the truth will last forever!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the truth is forever..." Earl of Pephos painted the cross with deep eyes, decided to be patient, and couldn't bear it? Fight against the church? A genie, nearly fifty legendary cardinals and sacred knights, blazing angels who can come at any time, what do they fight against? This is a horrible force than the past three magical empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with the gradual removal of the remnants of the magical empire, the church has become less and less dependent on its own aristocrats, and its attitude is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly traveled to the city church, when the sky was dark and clouded, and the rain seemed to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder exploded, the silver-white electric snake illumined the sky, and the Count of Pefus looked up at the sky, walked down the carriage, and entered the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Bishop, please allow me to pray to the Lord first." Count Peffes said politely that he had completely eliminated his inner dissatisfaction and resentment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is the county capital, close to Padre Harbour, the location is important, and relatively prosperous, so the bishop is a newly promoted Cardinal Field, he Gently beheaded: "This is your piety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before praying before the cross, Count Pefus smiled and said: "I don't know the bishop, you are looking for me. What's the matter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill looks like awkwardly: “According to the report of the night watchman, there are signs of magician activity in this area recently, I hope that you can invest more in the count. The energy is being traced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my responsibility." Count Peffes replied casually, waiting for the bishop to discuss matters that matter more importantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, then the count will go back and arrange it." Field smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing else?" Count Peffes blurted out in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fing raised his eyebrows: "What else is needed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a little, Pei The anger in the heart of the Forsyth took up, and called me for such a small thing? Send someone directly to say it! When is I? Church dog? Just call and call? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or the count you think this thing is not important enough." Field's smile faded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus tried to press the anger: "Please forgive me for the eagerness of the Lord, the bishop, since there is nothing, then I will go back and arrange Tracing things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out of the church with his expression, entered the carriage, and sat in a stone statue until the carriage drove a distance, roaring thunder The sound continued to ring, and his face became iron and blue, and a golden piece of scale appeared on the back of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's awful! We didn't treat our nobility equally!" Earl of Perfors secretly gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, torrential rain poured down, the night is darker, the whistling wind blows the trees and leaves on the roadside, from time to time with leaves, debris, etc. On the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the rain hit the top of the car, as if playing a musical instrument, Count Pefus looked out the window and smashed the night, the heart was difficult to calm for a long time, and the look was slightly confused. This is the true status of the nobility? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
