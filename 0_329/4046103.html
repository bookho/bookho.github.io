			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short, powerful, happy and smooth G major serenade begins with a clear beginning, Natasha’s purple eyes are suddenly bright, just the two melodies I lived up to her curiosity all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Felice’s twisted hands were unconsciously released by her. As a music student, she has enough discernment to judge the quality of the opening melody. This is the most impressive and most rhythmic part of the serenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So her nervousness faded and was infected by the follow-up music melody. The whole person became light and happy, the body followed the melody slightly and swayed, and the right hand patted the beat. I was amazed: "Even if it is a serenade-style piano piece, Lucien can also be a masterpiece and a classic. It is a genius musician who is the Lord's favor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the melodious, fun and cheerful melody, every guest is infected with pleasure and has the urge to dance, but this is the first time to listen to the talented musicians, so they have restrained themselves, full of laughter. Listening and listening to it, while watching Lucien's hands flow smoothly on the piano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his slender fingers full of rhythmic rhythm movements, pure and melodious notes seem to jump out one by one, and his body, arms, fingers and music are The integration of coordination is in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just music, Lucien’s play itself seems to carry an unspeakable beauty and temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that playing the piano will give you this feeling, with an elegant and noble atmosphere, full of charm." Seeing this scene of piano solo, no Knowing how many noble children and musicians have the idea of ​​learning the piano, the new piano playing skills themselves are an art in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many aristocratic girls see their eyes bright and their moods shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vivid and lively opening melody is repeated in the light dance melody, enhancing the gorgeous atmosphere of joy and clarity, and under its backdrop, the dance melody is revealed. The piano is different from the flavors of other instruments, and each note is full of texture, round and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a wonderful and cheerful music atmosphere, time flies very quickly. After a few minutes, Lucien presses the last note, and the right hand slanted upwards. Put away, this piano piece is finished, then stand up, right hand to raise the chest, toward Natasha, toward Felice, to other guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause sounded like a wave, and in the banquet occasion, this kind of bright and beautiful music was undoubtedly warmly welcomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elegant, gorgeous, balanced, Lucien you show your genius and spiritual surname to the extreme, this is a work without flaws." Nata Sa smiled with satisfaction and praised Lucien. As the future grandfather of Waorit, she is very "affirmed" that Aalto's musicians are the best in the continent and will not be surpassed by musicians of any country, no matter what form. The music is like this. "I am looking forward to Lucien. You will finish the next few movements. By then, I think it will become a handed down piece in the serenade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; She once again gave Lucien a very high evaluation, but did not point out the flaws that the Serenade could not avoid, that is, there are not many thoughts and connotations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis’s face turned red, and it was very exciting with the eyes that were crying slightly red and swollen before: “Lu Xien, thank you for your oyster gift, I think My rite will be remembered by the music history because of this serenade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy, Philippe." After the hug, Lucien returned Circle of musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher reveals the smile of the younger generation: "You have not lived up to our curiosity, Lucien, although it is still just a piano piece, but it has been able Let us feel the pure beauty of music. It is the most beautiful and moving piece of the serenade of similar style. I want to wait for you to complete it, it will be a classic that is enough to enter the elegant stage of the concert. Oh, although on serious occasions, it loses the interesting surnames."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can deny your genius, Lucien." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia is very satisfied with Lucien’s serenade, the smile is pure and sincere, and when Lu Xien played the piano, the body, arms and fingers were coordinated and full. The rhythm and beauty of the performance makes her a true heart for the piano. This is an absolutely elegant instrument. No matter the music or the performance itself, it has a special charm. It can be compared with the "Musical Queen" violin, and it is in the performance of delicate sound quality. Force, due to the pedal Clever use, not worse than the clavichord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the difficult content of the symphony and the thought surname, the style of the serenade is undoubtedly more popular among the civilians and the adventurers. Victor who once went to the pub to learn the wind knows this very well, "And Lu Xien is bold. I have used a lot of difficult skills. This is what I admire most. After all, your future is not a serenade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Victor still faintly advised Lu Xi'an said that there is a talented student. If the teacher is not a narrow-minded person, he will certainly be afraid to worry that his student has not taken the wrong path. Is he arrogant and has not deviated from the elegant music hall? Come, symphonies, concertos, sonatas, and operas are the objects that Lucian should concentrate on. Of course, in the learning stage, it is understandable to practice with other forms of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remember, Mr. Victor." Feeling the subtle and deep concern of Victor, Lucien's emotions are a bit complicated, except for the warm feeling. In addition, it is finally confirmed that Rhein knows the news of the Magic Council headquarters, and he has the goal of full struggle. Perhaps after a successful concert, he will embark on a new journey, and will definitely stay away from music in the future. The eager anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is a piano piece, it is gorgeous, exquisite and beautiful. It is the level that can not be achieved by many symphonies. It is the peak of music that expresses music beautifully. Other musicians around you, either gratified to see that a musical genius has not fallen, or disappointed to the extreme, because it is impossible to pick out the flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKantz’s expression was a bit distorted, and he glanced at Julian, who was deeply attacked, and then seemed to think of something, stood up and pointed to Lucy. Grace: "The performance you just played is not like a newcomer who has been studying the piano for a few months. You are the fallen person who traded with the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All musicians And the nearby aristocrats were surprised to turn their eyes. This is the most serious allegation, the allegation that Luisen is completely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McKantz, pay attention to your words, this piano piece is created by Lucien himself, and after several weeks of practice, even if he is Piano skills are not fully mastered, and they can skillfully play this one." Victor certainly stood up to defend his students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lott and Herodotus are silently accused of not talking, and the devil is involved, even if they are nobles, they are not willing to be free for Lucien. Excuse, if it is true? That would be to use his own life to justify Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKantz was just a moment of inspiration, but the more he wanted to be after the accusation, the more proud and stern look of Lucien’s eyes: “Mr. Victor, you The explanation is not acceptable. If Lucine’s performance is just normal, it is indeed in line with the skill of repeated practice. However, his playing is elegant and smooth, which is the standard of qualified performers. I would like to ask ladies. Mr., is it possible? Can only achieve this level of study in just a few months? The talent of creation can be said to be the gift of the Lord, born by nature, but the performance is hoarding and practicing. Lu Xien You betrayed the favor of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he said the more proud he had begun to pronounce the crime of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he said this, other people think about it just now, and found that it is true. Lucien’s performance is confident, full of charm, expressiveness and appeal. It is already possible to have a concert, so the eyes of doubt, fear, and worry are all condensed on Lucien to see what reason he uses to justify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s not Lucian who spoke, but Silvia, who has been quietly smiling and looking at McCann, her slightly hoarse voice A faint smile: "Mckanz, you better listen to other people's judgments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly, it seems that Natasha seems to be doing something Will tell her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Silvia, you see that everyone is aware of the hypocrisy, insidiousness and deceit of Lucien." McCannz did not dare to offend Silvia. With both hands stretched out on both sides, let her see the attitude of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor took a breath and defended Lucien. If this kind of thing was caught, Lucien would be on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this time, the mature lazy voice came: "I can testify that Lucien's playing skills are for other reasons, not related to any evil. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
