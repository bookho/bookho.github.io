			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10pm on June 3rd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whole city is still immersed in the unprecedented grand occasion of "returning concerts", when people are still immersed in the "Self-New Country" and "Ode to Joy" When the classics of the symphony are great, when the streets and lanes often hear the songs of "Ode to Joy" and the melodious and mellow melody of the second movement of "The New Kingdom", the people in the dark corner of Aalto have regained their usual life. And hold such a rare opportunity to hold a secret meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a seemingly ordinary civilian house in the Viola District, there are dozens of mysterious characters in the hidden basement, most of them wearing black belts of similar style. Hooded robes, a small part of the face wearing a variety of street can buy a mask, painted with children like bears, goats and other animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did the slinger, Mr. Sage, still not come?" A woman who covered her face with a hood but revealed a bump in her black robe The mysterious man surnamed the whispered, although the voice has changed, it still sounds a bit sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are surrounded by a round table with a few white candles and lots of books, paper and materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged man replied with his special cold and strange voice: "Mercury, how do I know? Mr. Sage is already a formal magician, and he has the right to come at the last moment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage did not withdraw from this magic apprentice circle after the dangerous Aalto became a formal magician, but instead guided by a teacher-like attitude. Other magic apprentices, and exchanged some magic potion formulas to them, so he soon became the essence of this magic circle, so many magic apprentices benefited from it, at least the hanged himself is getting closer to the formal magician Rank, and he also vaguely felt that the strength of Mercury, Morning Star, and Reindeer was greatly improved. I don’t know if it has become a formal magician, or by magical potions and magical arrays to enhance other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still five minutes. If Mr. Sage has not come yet, we must leave." Before the Mercury answered, the black robe man wearing a reindeer mask He hoarse voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magic apprentices have nodded in agreement, and this kind of hidden circle party does not tolerate someone late, because lateness often represents an accident, not a little bit lucky . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning Star heard the words of the reindeer and smiled bitterly: "It is really depressing and annoying to be vigilant and fearful of life at all times."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to suppress the pain, it's just like a fire wolf." The hanged person sneered coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, all the whispering magic apprentices were quiet, although there is no definitive evidence to show that no one has witnessed and completely heard of Mel. What happened in the forest of Zehei, but from a few simple and easily inquired facts, it can be judged that the fire wolf is a traitor lurking in the magic circle. For example, the fire wolf volunteered to know the ruins, such as the fighting party is a large number of night watchers. For example, since then the professor has not come, such as the professor "Rong" to the list of purification sequences - they know from the official magicians of other circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling this matter, the voice is hoarse but there is still a bit of sweet and touching mercury sighing gently: "Unfortunately we have traitors out of it, let Mr. Professor hastily left Aalto. He didn’t have time to tell us where the Magic Council headquarters is. Otherwise, we don’t have to feel confused and depressed. We can’t find the 'light paradise' and feel that there is no way ahead.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the professor, she is deeply awe-inspiring, this comes from the profound knowledge that she experienced, from the horror magic that she witnessed, from his own Boarded the purification sequence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several newly added magic apprentices often hear the name of "Mr. Professor" from the original members, and they are full of curiosity, but they are not Suspecting the description of Mercury, being able to enter the purification sequence proves everything - this is the same great awesome as the magicians of other circles mentioned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that Professor Mr. was just an ordinary mid-level magician. I couldn’t think of him being much more terrible than I thought..." The hanged man was cold and sighing, suddenly There was a unique knock on the entrance to the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury cautiously walked to the door of the secret room and whispered a question: "Mr. Sage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a two-story civilian house with a basement, with numerous The entrance to the window, so they did not arrange the first identification measures at the gate, but placed a magic trap directly on the walkway leading to the secret room, and confirmed the identity by knocking on the door and the problem, so that they could be detected in advance, and they would be ready early. The magic means to escape from the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me." The voice of the sage is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar voice, peaceful tone, coupled with mental faintness, did not sense abnormalities, and the magic apprentices put down their hanging hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time someone comes, they tighten the string, which is an unspeakable painful feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury removes the magic trap, opens the door, and sees the sage wearing black magic robes and hood shadows covering the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, Mr. Sage." All the apprentices supported the right hand and were deeply envious, paying tribute to the sage by the etiquette of the ancient magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they finished the ceremony, they looked up, but they all took a breath, because the sage stood still surrounded by a cold, black magic robe. The mysterious person, and myself and others have not even noticed any problems at all. In the vague mental power induction, the sages are empty before and after! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sage, what do you mean?! Why do you suddenly bring a stranger over?!" Go back to God, Mercury angrily accuses, this is similar The most taboo thing in secret gatherings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is allowed to bring someone without prior notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged and other people, despite their indignation and worry, did not vocalize like Mercury, because the sage is a formal magician, and he can kill it alone. All magic apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mercury really hides its strength, maybe it has become a formal magician..." Seeing this scene, they silently thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage laughed and said: "Mercury, don't be excited, he is not a stranger, but also participated in our party."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, who?" Mercury and other magic apprentices asked in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mercury, hanged, morning star, reindeer, don't you remember me?" Lucien once again used a deliberately distorted cold and hoarse voice, while Unleashing the powerful spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no longer the oppression of the magical items, but the authentic mid-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged person and so on only felt that the black robe magician was cold and horrible, as if he could never reach the bottom of the abyss, just saw him and felt him The breath makes you tremble all over the body, and the cold from the heart spreads to every part of the body. If he is not just a momentum, no real oppression, he and other magic apprentices have already fallen to the ground, not to mention the concentration of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate magician, absolute mid-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mid-level magician who has a heaven and earth difference from a magic apprentice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Mercury is a little normal, although she subconsciously retreats two steps, the bare hands are barely shaking, but more is just horror than being Suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembled: "Mr. Professor? Mr. Professor! You are Professor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The only strange middle-level magician I know is only Professor Mr.! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very glad that you can recognize me." Lucien replied with a grin, but it is also very clear that mercury is not deliberately distorted by himself. The hoarse voice that can often be heard in the magic circle and the figure that is once again elevated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call! call! ...the sound of amazement and fear is loud and loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
