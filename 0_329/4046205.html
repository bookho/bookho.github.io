			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t expect to meet this kind of thing, focusing on magic experiments and parsing magic, except for Rock, Jerome, K, and the same office. A few familiar teachers will occasionally talk a few words. They have always been quiet and focused. There is no eye-catching place. Even if it is so low-key, it is even complained. It is inevitable that it will be a little depressed and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a habit of hard work, how can Lucien give up easily, admit mistakes, and sincerely think after thinking: "Mr. President, I think I The methods of teaching the basics of arcane and magic are very effective. The ancient magic language, hell language and magical creatures of the 'Thorn Tree' class and the 'Blood Bird' class have significantly improved their level of mastery. They are also good for my style. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Donald's answer was short and powerful. Once again, Lucien expected that he would admit that his teaching method worked well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Donald’s positive evaluation, the words turned: “But Lucien, you didn’t look at the school rules? Apprentices should maintain absolute respect for the magic teacher and the classroom order. Magic teachers must also demonstrate sufficient dignity. Your teaching style encourages apprentices to disrespect teachers and classroom order. This is a serious violation of the rules and traditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Many methods may work well, but they are based on the premise of breaking the rules. This is not allowed, such as a magic item, whether it is done by the task itself or by the weak. The degree of easiness is different. Should we encourage and teach apprentices which ones to choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I hope you will reflect and understand these reasons." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxien has nothing to say, even if he proposes to punish the results of the three courses of the apprentices, President Donald will certainly not accept it because What he cares about is not the teaching effect. Bad question, but on the strict hierarchical order clearly inherited from the ancient magic of the empire between the apprentice and the official magician of maintenance, although the old-fashioned but it does meet the conditions of this world, so the unlimited rise truth unassailable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s silence did not speak, Donald thought he understood the serious surname of the matter, so smile gave a little encouragement: “Lu Xien, I know, young people Always full of thoughts, there are bad and good inside, for example, you will appreciate the method of strengthening the test exercises, decided to promote in the entire magic school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a part of the abandonment of the apprentices, leaving only the sea tactics they hate. Lucien licked his temples and felt that he would be cursed by apprentices. Even if you just keep the frequency of staying in practice every day and testing once a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Out of Donald’s office, it seems that I heard what happened to Roque’s surname and took a picture of Lucien’s shoulder: “How? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop the class for one month, halving the salary, retaining the right to use the magic lab, the school library, and the low-cost purchase of materials, if it is violated next time, Then I will leave the job automatically.” Lucian had no idea about the suspension of classes, so he could concentrate on the consolidation after the second ring, but half of the salary would be heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock heard, whispered a swearing words: "The electromagnetic system is a group of carefully watched bastards. They also teach 'thorn The tree 'class and 'blood bird' class, compared with the apprentices in private, feel that their electromagnetic basics and other old-fashioned seriousness is not interesting, and the effect is not good. Later, these evaluations were secretly told by some apprentices, they I think that you have broken the atmosphere and seriously violated the school rules, so I confess to you here, President Donald. Asshole, if I find the opportunity in the future, I will never let them go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this." Lucien finally understood the reason for his "innocent disaster." Any new thing is always resisted by the old order, whether it is good or bad. At the same time, a little ridiculous feeling also made Lucien unable to resist the abdomen: "The guys are really annoying. Is it because my name is followed by X, the nickname is a professor, is it subject to the hostility of the electromagnetic faction? Beyat looks dumb. I can't think of doing this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beate black hair, ordinary ordinary image appears in Lucien’s mind, but he can enter Douglas Magic School, which has a good level in the field of electromagnetic magic, is currently a first-class arcian, a two-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock and Lucien walked side by side on the magic tower stairs, he half-jokingly and semi-scientificly said: "Lu Sien, you are evaluated by the apprentices as the most Cool, the teacher with the most surname. Even if you practiced this week every day, they hate them very much, and the popularity is more than me. However, 'I don’t have to listen or practice in my class, as long as the final assessment can pass' In this case, how can you casually say it? Even if you are really doing it, acquiescence, you should not say it. Their complaints can be successful, mainly because of these words, not your humorous teaching."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock took up his serious expression, laughed and said with indignation: "In fact, what order, what tradition, not the big guys have the final say? If Lucien you are a big arcian, even if you say this, use this Kind of style teaching, do they dare to complain about you? Do you criticize that you violate the tradition and violate the school rules? I am afraid that you will loudly praise the Lucian Grand Arctic Master for the open humor, not so old-fashioned, greatly enhance the effect of the apprenticeship, is us "Model of learning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, Rock, you are funny, but it makes sense." Lucien laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the lunch break, Jerome, K, Vernier and other magic teachers have come to the garden villa to comfort Lu Xien, and a total of Into lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the lunch, Annick, Reyia and Heidi, who heard the punishment decision, also rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s surprise that Sprint and Katrina followed them, and the squad Grant and a beautiful Lucie don’t know. Wen Jing girl, she is about 17 or 18 years old, has a unique seaweed green hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans..." Annick, Heidi and Reyia wanted to comfort Lucien, but they didn’t know what to say, 憋For a long time, they said together, "We will always support you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint lowered his head, the dark red hair shook slightly and seemed to nod, Katrina and Grant also learned that Annick had a fist and waved his fist: "Mr. Evans, we feel that your lecture is great and will always support you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Grant whispered aloud: "If you don't leave practice every day, it's better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I will be very Go back to class." Lucien didn't ask them to fight for themselves, because in a serious traditional magic school, they would definitely be fired if they did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majesty of the magic school and the official magician has long been so that they did not have this idea. After chatting a few words, Heidi suddenly said: Mr. Evans, several of our magic apprentices are from across the Stormwind Strait. There are still a lot of gaps between the apprentices here in the subtleties of arcane and magical foundations. It is hard to learn and analyze magic every day, and it is a bit of a catch-up. Just if you have a month of free time, can you take some time to guide us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will not let Mr. Evans guide you in vain, these days we are on Some small things that have been successfully refining the alchemy course have been recycled by the school, and some Yinnaar have been smashed!" Lei Yiya added childishly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evacuation, tutoring? Arcane cram school?" Lu Xien suddenly felt ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Heidi, Lei Yiya, Katrina nodded seriously: "Yes, please Mr. Evans, help us to tutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has not answered yet, K is a smile on the side: "Lu Xien, they can find their own deficiencies, and have the courage to look for opportunities, it is very Appreciate. If you have time, it is better to help them. I have time and guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have to experiment every night, During the day you have to go to class and practice magic, it will be fixed on Saturday afternoon. And how can I be cheeky to ask for the money of several children? You can become the official magician is the best reward!" Lucien was helped by K After that, I also consciously wanted to do something to give back to the society. Anyway, I have a lot of time this month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the Arcane cram school really give back to the society, isn’t it to retaliate against the society?" Lucien thought divergently, and then said, "What are you going to do?" Come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I." Heidi raised his hand, and Lei Yiya and Annick also nodded excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina’s cheeks are red, but boldly staring at Lucien’s eyes: “Mr. Evans, I want to participate.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to..." Sprint's voice was very weak, and I could see that my face and ears were red. Grant shook his head and smiled and said: "Mr. Evans, I think I can keep up with others..." He has always been a leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
