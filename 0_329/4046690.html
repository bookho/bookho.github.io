			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary magicians and a monster close to the gods are in a fierce battle, and the aftermath is swaying the entire world behind the door. The atmosphere of destruction, the space seems to collapse at any time, and the lifeless forest of death has turned into a real end. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the legendary magicians of the ancient magical empire, Douglas's head is surrounded by bright gems. They are like artificial planets, some are gold and blue, some are sea blue, and some are pure red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gems are faintly ignorant, and with the different spells of the spells, weaving the "field" of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tuxedo became a black majestic robes, typical of the ancient magical empire style, with a deep, dark light on the surface, isolated from the "Monster Benedict III" Made of the Holy Light Ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He floated in front of two things, one is the exclusive legendary item "The Star of the Star", one is a thick book, deep black , silver and white lines, constantly flipping, playing a legendary magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this unreasonable monster, Douglas used all his legendary items, two legendary peaks, two legendary third-order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando lost his red color in his right eye, becoming dark and dark, like the whirlpool of the sea, and the source of destruction, constantly blowing high-energy storms, playing in the stars All kinds of wonderful curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the culprit in turning the dead forest into a final place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright red robes on his body control everything around him, and Benedict III, who dominates the posture and changes the monsters, fights for control of the environment, and the right hand takes A dark black scepter that Shane had never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scepter seems to be writhing like a life, but it is erratic, full of chaos, giving the impression of endless abyss. Every time Fernando uses it, it creates a large chaotic area that destroys everything, including space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary sorcerers used their own cards, but there is still no way to overwhelm the "headless pope", the holy blessing, the light of judgment The Purifying Spear, the Horn of Heaven, the Flame of the Pure World, the Holy Cross, the sigh of the wind, the eye of the gods, all kinds of magical skills, the power is endless, but Douglas and Fernando are firmly suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Douglas slightly scared, not for the strength of the monster - even if it is the real pope, without the gods, he is sure to retreat, But because I don't understand the state of the monster! In general, this evil and strange monster is inherently restrained by the gods, but it can behave like a real pope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really more than an imaginary monster." Douglas sighed in the mind line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is more strenuous than him, but not confused: "We are looking for opportunities to retreat in the direction of the entrance, it can't stop us!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" Douglas fully agrees that this adventure is only to the soul of the fireplace, there is no need to entangle with a strange and unimaginable monster, and Lucien has not yet Killed by a monster, the opportunity to be entangled by yourself, should also be close to the entrance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early August, even the wind was full of scorching heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meeting room of the Supreme Council, once again discuss Douglas, Fernando and Lucien who have not returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we have to organize an adventure team to rescue again." "The Emperor in Control" Brooke folded his fingers and looked around at other members. "This time. Will you be led by me, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is exhausted, but has an unusual excitement, in the past few months, from the perspective of electronic waves He faintly touched another road to solve the problem of the new alchemy. If there are still some problems in the basics of mathematics and mathematics, some experimental phenomena have not been considered, and perhaps the results have already been achieved. However, at the juncture of the magical parliament, he still has no hesitation. I put down the experiment and decided to organize the manpower to go to the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no friends forever, no eternal enemies, and only eternal interests. Brooke believes that the words that Lucien said have the same applies to the Northern Church, which has a good relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest to wait another month." The soul of the soul, Vicente, whispered in a hoarse voice. "The flow of time near the soul fireplace is unusually slow. I suspect it was only inside." Less than a day, the Speaker of the House, Fernando, and Lucien Evans may be on their way back to the entrance. In this case, it is irresponsible for the parliament to organize the team rescue."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of desire for the secret behind the soul fireplace, but he is afraid of the unknown danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I agree with Vicente's opinion, wait another month, then I will go with Brooke." Oliver nodded and made a statement. It is not timid, but it is not necessary for the time being. The two legendary magicians should not be so easily trapped inside, especially the mysterious existence of the dead spirits and fall back into sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is similar to Brooke, at the critical moment of the breakthrough in the study of electronic wave equations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri looked at Natasha sitting next to her - she was invited to attend the meeting of the Supreme Council, with no expression: " The prophet did not predict that Lusien was in danger of falling. After one month, if they had not returned, they must start on time and I will participate in the rescue team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The meeting quickly reached a consensus, and Brooke sighed softly. He said to Hathaway: "You have provided a genius-like idea for solving the atomic model with two electrons. This is the victory of matrix mechanics. I am not now. If you doubt its value again, you still can't understand the meaning of the arcane behind it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing." Hathaway is indifferent and concise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook looked at Natasha again: "I hope you can understand our decision, because it is still difficult to confirm that they are in danger, of course, this paragraph Time I will meet in the outer area of ​​the Temple of the Dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After organizing the adventure team, although it is powerful, it can play a greater role, but if it encounters At the time of danger, the single legendary peak is more likely to get out of trouble. This is one of the reasons why Brooke decided to go to the team and not organize the adventure team for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Natasha's expression was firm, and the silver-purple eyes did not fluctuate. Then she got up. "Lord Brooke, please allow me to leave first, I still I have to temper my blood and skills, complaining that I can't solve any problems, I can only start from the direction I am good at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi holds the latest issue of "Arcane", full of admiration to Annick and others: "Hersea Hatha pointed out that there are two solutions The path of the atomic model of electrons is really the radiance of genius, haha, which also proves the correctness of the teacher matrix mechanics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have thought about solving this problem, There is no direction at all, is this the gap with the Arcanist?" Katrina exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Lei Yiya and others also read this paper, and I am very impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher's matrix mechanics is complicated and difficult to understand, and there is no specific arcane meaning, but there is no doubt that it is a correct direction, from particle surnames and discontinuities. The direction of the last name." Sprint's eyes are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meaning of arcane will always be found." Here, Heidi suddenly smiled. "The new alchemy textbook of Holt School of Magic has to have Changed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucien? Evans principal and professor stipulates that she is a glorious "instructor." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Annick, what are you studying with Sprint recently?" The relationship between them is very good, so Lei Yiya No curious to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick did not conceal: "We may have thought of how to explain Bruker's abnormal splitting phenomenon, introducing a concept of electron spin with a quantum number of one-half. This will lead to some strange problems, the electronic surface rotates far faster than the speed of light..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
