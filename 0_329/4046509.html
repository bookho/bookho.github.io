			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changing appearance of Lucien walked along the Sonar River towards the slums, where there were a lot of secret altars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of storms, the goddess of the earth, etc., who were expelled from the valley, certainly did not want to give up the "rich resources of faith", so they each left Secret preachers, and Lucien is trying to "inquire" from their mouths to the status quo of the false gods, in order to judge the progress of El and Francis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been more than half a month since the spread of the plausible “story”, Lucian intends to stop from the present, no longer take the risk of changing the image, let the rumors brew, Through the maritime traders and traders, they spread to other parts of the world, causing concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From now on, watch the changes and seize the opportunity to get rid of the dangers." The evening wind on the Sonar River boasted to Lucy with the unique moistness of the rainy season. On the face, the hotness of the evening began to change a little refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s left hand was shaken uncontrollably, his head slightly stunned, and there was a feeling of coldness behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this?" Lucien was shocked, and the situation of uncontrolled jitter in his left hand has become more frequent in recent days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne was thought to be the precursor to the wake of the moon, Aitna, who was sleeping for half a month, or the signal of his expression of hunger. I plan to find a living ritual with many gods in the fields of death, silver moon, tranquility, etc., to appease him slightly, but after several consecutive times, Lucien has noticed that this dangerous chill is from herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it true that Aitna, who recovered her strength during sleep, has any problems with my body or soul, so I reminded me in this way? It may be that with the slight recovery of his power, my left hand can use a little bit, so I discovered the potential inconsistency or hidden danger between the body and the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which kind of possibility, the problem points to Lucien himself, so that his thoughts are very dignified, the strange magic or curse of the main material world is a lot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of the problem must be found tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Converging the mood, wearing linen robes Lucian walked into the slums, this time he pretended to be a secret believer of the "earth of the earth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on?" A poor man who passed by whispered, pointing his eyes to the direction of progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also whispered: "Well, look for the Angrid priest to pray."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the prompts, Lucien went to the broken street on the right, and met a believer along the way. At their prompts, after seven turns and eight turns, he finally saw an ordinary mud house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling of familiar face is good." Lucien touched the face that was not his own. When he first came, he used hints and instructions along the way. , hypnosis, charm and other magic to get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the mud house, inside is a thin old man, he climbed directly on the ground and kissed the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angri priest, bothering you to pray," Lucine said politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrim is a wrinkled face with an uncontrollable smile: "I don't care, I am very happy, I heard the news of the two false gods falling." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is a secret missionary, the number of believers who can fight for it is undoubtedly much less, so the battle between the six sects becomes naked, leaving behind the priests The relationship has also deteriorated rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, the two false gods fall?" Lucien truly showed his surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrid stood up from the ground: "When I prayed in the morning, I got the revelation of the mother god, but I always suspected that I understood wrong, half a An hour ago, I finally confirmed that the gods in the secret altar of 'The God of Storms' and 'Eros of God' broke down, and the priests lost the power of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Was it deprived of the surname of God by the 'God of Redemption'?" Lucien didn't think that El's battle was so amazing that he could kill the two false gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his attitude, Lucien suddenly realized that some of the six false gods had betrayed. At least the Mother Earth was attached to El, so that he could kill two false gods unexpectedly! Otherwise, if they watched each other and helped each other, even if there was a false god accident, El and Francis did not dare to do it. They would doubt that this was the trap that they and the Lord of War had set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the mother be blessed." Lucien saluted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angrid draws a cross on the chest where Lucien wants to laugh: "It should be called the angel of the earth."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not intend to conceal this news from believers. This difficult moment is to rely on similar messages to inspire people and strengthen their faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough." Lucien smiled and "really" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the slum, Lucien changed his appearance again in the woods by the river, and the cover of the night returned to the slum in another direction. This time the goal is "The God of Redemption" El's Secret Church to confirm the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a preacher, Lucien and Anthony are aware of several contact believers in Husum City, so the most easily grasped source of information after the death This is it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the slums, Lucien suddenly heard the sound of someone walking back and forth in the corner, his eyes turning slightly, penetrating the darkness, and seeing a man wearing linen Young man in a robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a woman." Lucian’s eyes narrowed slightly, and the woman who disguised herself as a poor man aroused his interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Lucien was secretly looking for outsiders who might have problems, trying to find the night watchman and get the information he needed, so Two points of "night and quiet" and "doing professional camouflage" are worthy of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without stopping, Lucien continued to move forward until he entered the poor area, found a dark place where no one was, and confirmed that he had left the sensing range of others before he condensed Spiritual power, instant knowledge, and then changed the image again, "step by foot" out of the slums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to that corner, Lucien pretended to glance at it inadvertently, his pupils deep and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-ring astrology magic "true knowledge" exists for the illusion, invisibility, deformation, darkness, ambiguity, mirroring, secret door and a small amount of special alien space The powerful spell, under the eyes of the blessing, under the gap, the woman's disguise was directly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sophia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recognized the elf-like woman. She is the princess of the sacred Heerz Empire, Sophia, and when she sees her, Lucien remembers her horrible father Rudolph II, the legendary powerhouse who apparently has touched the seven ancient ancient devils and the mysteries of the gods. I feel a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when I first recognized Sophia, I planned to "kidnapped" her, and Lu Xien, who had tortured the magical parliament control area, dismissed the idea, who knows the mysterious Did Rudolph II project onto his daughter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien shook his head slightly, speeding up and preparing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Sophia, who had escaped from the robbery, was still in the same place, full of disgust at the stupid slum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just took two steps, his eyes suddenly solidified, and a familiar man came out of the woods by the river, Francis! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His direction is where Sophia is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did they collude together?" Lucien stepped a little slower and felt Francis’s gaze coming over, so he forcibly converged his emotions. Unexpectedly moving forward, and at this time, a man with a linen robes coming out of the slums, the temperament is gloomy but gives a feeling of tyranny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis has been staring at Lucian’s back until he has left, not paying attention to the matter, only to regain his gaze, to Sophia and the slums The man who came out nodded: "I am very punctual, we change places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
