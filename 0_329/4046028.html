			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "simple", so "sincere" Lucian, let Victor can no longer hold back, laughed, tears will flow out, others Whether it was Rheinland, or Lott, Felice, etc., they laughed very fiercely and could not maintain their grace. Even the old gentleman of Xavier shook his head and smiled, but Anne, Colin and so on could not follow Victor. Music students, laughter with faint bitterness and jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at everyone’s reaction in disbelief, probably understands that his lack of common sense is a joke, but they are not surprised and confused. Not too serious, so I asked out, "Mr. Victor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor coughed a few times, convulsed a smile, and looked at Lucien seriously: "I mean, Lucien, are you willing to follow me to learn music? Although you are older, the music is more about talent, and even if you are talented, follow me for a few years. Can also become a qualified musician, do not have to worry about future life, Aalto out of the musician, but other countries aristocrats most like to invite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he paused Humorously added: "Of course, the tuition is free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lott, Rhein and others laugh again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Victor, his students are divided into three types, one is to learn the text, five silver per month, if he is fancy, get If you allow, you can become a second student. The student who follows him to study music, 10 Yinnar every month, can only become his third student when he is learning music, showing his outstanding talent or talent. He performed and used his relationship and reputation as a true disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a disciple, Victor currently has only one, he has become an outstanding musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lott, Felice, Herodotus belong to the second, Lucien, if promised, is the second, but it is free. 10 Yinnar's tuition per month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Professor Victor’s students, there are about seven Jintales in a year, which is equivalent to the best of the non-commercials in the civilian class, that is, one qualified The musician's annual income, such as Anne's father, the Aalto City Court clerk's salary for a year is only 15 Jintal, but most of Victor's income comes from the performance of the invitation by the nobility, other national music associations. Normally, there are 100 Jintales in a year, and this is the higher level that can be achieved by those who do not have their own estates and do not do business in the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if Victor pushes away all the invitations in the last year and can’t make ends meet, there’s nothing wrong with getting rid of Lucien’s tuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian didn’t think of Victor’s thanks, but he wanted to collect himself as a student who studied music. For a moment, he was a little hesitant, but soon, Lucien I thought about the contents of the witch's notes, and I have to repay the thoughts of Uncle Joel's family. I thought about it myself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know where to learn magic. A good place, for a long time, I am afraid I will continue to live in Aalto. After all, it is the largest and most prosperous city in the west, the closest to the dark mountains, and the most complicated city in private. I want to find magic materials and inquire about the news. It's a lot easier here. In this case, it is a good choice to use music students or musicians to cover up the magician's identity and earn the money you need. This is a very respectable career in Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the intention to start learning magic in Aalto, Lucian does not want to use the various inventions and materials in the library to make money, because it is easy to attract the attention of the church. ,Wait Safe place to learn magic, country, and then to do so too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in my heart were quickly sorted out. Lucien showed a sincere smile: "Thank you, Mr. Victor, I hope you can teach me wonderful and elegant music. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor nodded with satisfaction: "Lu Xien, your simplicity, diligence, seriousness and cleverness, I have rarely seen it, I hope that you will be able to There is a certain achievement on the music road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is finished, even if Lucien is allowed to follow him to learn music, Anne, Colin and others suddenly change. I have some loss and unhappiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really not simple." Lucien couldn’t help but refute a sentence. Just did not have common sense, and felt Colin and Renee Waiting for someone to look at their own eyes is quite complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien, after having no music foundation, borrowed the "Universal Dictionary" and went out of the hall to prepare to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Lucien." Brown hair, the small, delicate and delicate Renee suddenly came up from behind, showing a sunny smile, "I It’s Renee, Renee Weisz, you’re really talented in learning words and languages.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is busy going back to the dictionary to thoroughly check the witch’s notes Interpretation, how can I talk to Renee: "Hello, Renee, I am leaving late today, I am in a hurry, I will talk to you again in the next day, sorry, I am in a hurry."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a coincidence, you are busy with yours, Lucien, goodbye.” Renee smiled, but quickly recovered, full of understanding and thoughtfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anne and the aristocratic male student Siemag passed the other side of Lucien, snorted, and then looked at the two and kept elegant. Steps, go outside the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them and Lucien, Renee’s smile solidified, and I didn’t expect that I just wanted to establish a normal personal friendship with Lucien. Anne was dissatisfied, and the deliberate approach and appreciation of these days was completely wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin and David, looked at Renee with a smirk, and looked at Lucien’s back and shook his head, why didn’t he Such good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to his own cabin in Adejan, only five More points, close to the summer of Alto is still bright, Lucien found an excuse to read hard, told Eliza to go to her house at night, and then baked a piece of black bread to fill the hunger, as for exemption from tuition, eight Yinnar gave all the good things to Eliza, and then pushed them to tell them tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, for Lucien, there is nothing more important than reading witch notes and learning magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having eaten the black bread, Lucien will lock the repaired wooden door, put out the paper and the quill, and make a learning look, then open the soul book. Pavilion, quickly include the dictionary into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing this, Lucien opened the witch's magic notes and read them carefully against the dictionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the experience and accumulation of the previous few days, at around 10 o'clock in the evening, Lucien has interpreted all the contents of the magic notes except the last few pages. My heart was long and relieved: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the ancient witch’s text of the witch is not well learned, so the magic notes are recorded in great detail. Some even copy the notes of the family ancestors, I can completely learn the magic according to her records, but her magic notes only end up how to become a formal magician, and then I need to find another way, or learn from the magic notes. Ancient Hillvanas text, deciphering "The Book of Astrology and Elements.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a formal magician, now Lucien can start learning magic It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the witch’s record, in the ancient magical empire, the magic is recognized as the mysterious change of the four basic elements of earth, fire, wind and water under the influence of spiritual power. Later, it added light, darkness, soul, etc., and was able to summon monsters from hell, abyss or other alien spaces, so the magic was divided into eight factions: elemental, star, dead, illusion, summoning The force field system, the change system, the alchemy system, and the book "Astrology and Elements" is based on the elemental system and the star system, and contains a small amount of other magical books of other faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before becoming a formal magician, you can't learn a ring of magic, you can only learn informal magic, called a magic apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell structure of informal magic is very simple. In Lucine’s view, it’s just a clear rune of standard geometric patterns of junior high school, simpler than six-pointed star. Then, by mourning its pronunciation, and using the mental power to stimulate the corresponding magic material to form a rune, it can be performed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the standard of mental power, that is, from the fullness of mental energy to cognac, the amount of informal magic that can be used at one time, the magic apprentice is divided into third-order, trainee, Formal and advanced, respectively, five, ten, and twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to successfully construct one becomes a formal magician, and the casting of this spell will not require the cooperation of spells, casting materials, and gestures, depending on whether the mental power is exhausted and whether it is still in the buffer period of the last magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this, Lucien pressed his eagerness to try and continued to interpret the last few pages, intending to look at it completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met another magician today, and I actually met other magicians in Aalto! He looks like a reclusive magician. A lot of different, very weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading a page, Lucien suddenly interprets this important content, Aalto really has other magic Teacher exists! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s spirit is uplifting and continues to be interpreted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“in the sewer I found a strange red-eyed mouse with a magical taste. I don’t know where it came from. I haven’t found it for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Red-eyed mice breed extremely fast, blood is poisonous, slightly hallucinogenic and paralyzed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With Lapland blood vine, the effect is unexpectedly good, I envision The magic trap can finally be laid out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who did they cultivate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Here, Lucien couldn't help but glance at the ground. If the red-eyed mice are not magic creatures cultivated by witches, who are they, and there are other dangers in the sewers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien quickly went on to interpret:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And met the magician again, he The insights into magic are so different, the knowledge is very profound, and there is a fascinating charm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, he actually said ancient magic, except many Powerful and weird spells can be referenced and used, others are completely outdated, obscenity, instinctive exploration, how is it possible?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He gave me I read a collection of his magic books, not thick. It is a book called a journal. This magic book is called "Arcane." According to his explanation, 'Ao' represents the knowledge of the world's origin and law of operation. Arcane is the meaning of the essence and principle of magic. It is very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This "Arcane" is the first issue issued more than 300 years ago. On the first page, there is a great Arcanist's article, which is a speech of his magic meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "From his expression, he is very respectful to the great arcian, even to the point of worship."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I read this article carefully There is a trembling feeling in the whole body. I don't even know how to get back home. The brain is messy. I have to record it. Why have I never thought about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These lines of text are the same as most of the text on the last page. The letters are big and small, undulating, seemingly messy and trembling. It seems that their master is in a very excited mood. Lucien interprets it in a puzzled way. I want to see what the article that the witch can't calm down for so long:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., ladies, many years ago, our esteemed ancestors, From the dragons, from the elves, from the giants, from the demons, the devils, and various magical creatures, they learned how to use their mental power, and then analyzed their body structure and blood traits, stepping through their blood and transforming themselves. Body, invented a lot of enhancements Divine meditation thoughts, and with reference to the magic structure inside and outside their bodies, created various kinds of magic, which gained powerful power, drove the devil back to the abyss, kicked the devil back to hell, and let the dragons, elves, The giants either retreat to the remote mountains, the wilderness and the alien space, or surrender to our feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glorious victory, let ancient legendary magic The division is more persistent in pursuing strength, going to the abyss, to hell, to all kinds of different space to conquer, until the truth of the gods grows up, in just a few hundred years, the three magical empire is destroyed, the glory of the past has become the future Bitter, stunned and desperate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear gentlemen, ladies, it’s time to be quiet, don’t be fooled by power, calm down and think about some problems, we need Make it clear: "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
