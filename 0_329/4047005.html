			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decaying mud exudes a stench, and a wild wolf who breaks into it under a panic is deeply immersed in it, mourning that he wants to pull his leg out, but it falls more and more Deep, until the sludge drowned its ear and nose, interrupted its screams. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vincent returned to the swamp, he saw this scene and saw a sullen black robes floating in the place where he was constantly active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only white bones left in the place where the black robes are exposed, and the needle-shaped red flames are beating in the hollowed eyes. The clothes are gorgeous gold lines. pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also noticed the return of Vicente, with a hoarse and gloomy voice as the dead: "Where did you go? The magic council has messengers to come over." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente faintly said: "Go home and solve some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp And, picking up Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going home? Solving things? You slaughtered the city? Have you destroyed the church and the referee in the city?" The black robe sorrow said with horror and anger. "Do you know how much trouble this will cause us? Do you want to ruin the organization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dead body in the case of an absolute advantage of the church Master Tucheng, this is definitely a provocation to the extreme, will definitely lead to the legendary level to hunt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congus, this is my business, if you are not satisfied, I can quit the organization." Vicente simply replied, without any arguments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lich is the leader of the "soul supreme", the Archmage Congas, the change of the original Kukes, he took the death of the soul to protect the many spells Surprisingly, he escaped, but later the "soul is high" was also hit by the destruction of the surname, only a small number of members escaped, he also had to completely hide for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, the wind passed a little, he left the hidden place, trying to reorganize the "soul supreme", in the process, he accidentally learned that "death lord" The half-plane was never found by the church and seemed to be closed automatically. So he returned to the swamp near Cux, looking for the half-plane clue that the "death lord" might have left, and the accident was discovered in the swamp. A self-taught necromancer, Vicente? Miranda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just a few common Necromancer books and materials that are not complete in the swamp, he turned out to be a formal magician within a few years. Congas, who is planning to reorganize the "soul to the highest", appreciates it very much. In the name of the guide, he has replaced Vicente into "the soul is supreme." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what happened over the past twenty years has made Congos unable to believe his eyes. This guy named "Vicente Miranda" may be Because there is no formal magic education, many ideas are contrary to the fundamental concept of the Necromancer, but because of this, he is completely free from the constraints of the past, and he actually improved and corrected many Necromantic concepts. The human body structure and the circulation field have made great breakthroughs repeatedly, and received several real-world feedbacks, and promoted the Nine Rings at a speed unimaginable by Congus! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-eight years from scratch, becoming a Master, this is definitely a genius in the magical genius, even in the heyday of the magical empire, according to Congers As far as I know, there are only four or five who can compare this record. Even the "Sun King" Tanos, who is known as the most powerful magician, is also the special one of the "Destiny of the Destiny". Long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Congers also benefited greatly from the huge breakthrough made by Vicente, plus the magic that came from the Magic Council. The Mathematical Principles of Philosophy and the Foundation of Calculus, his cognitive world is almost semi-cured, and he is confident that he will try to promote the legend within 50 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Congersâ€™s feelings about Vicente are very complicated, obviously people who are prepared to be treated and cultivated as students, and they will be with themselves in a short time. He is equal and has the strength to fight with his own, so that he has not had time to rebuild the organization and have established a teacher-student relationship with him to cultivate a friendship that can be trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Congus did not suppress Vicente and protect his rights, because he knew that Vicente might have had an odds and relied on a strange The item sacrifices some of its own flesh and blood, otherwise he may not be able to break through to the official mage in the harsh environment and materials. Therefore, if he wants to promote the legend, he needs a larger theoretical breakthrough and takes longer. And when you are different, when you don't have to shoot yourself, Vicente will bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cux has a 'mad dog'." Vicente did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just a night watchman?" Congers breathed a sigh of relief. "I will tell the various branches and organizations that they have recently paid attention to concealment." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente nodded gently: "Who is the messenger of the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is here I am very interested in things, because he read "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" and "Basic Calculus" in Congus, which shocked the thoughts contained in it and linked his own achievements in the human body structure and circulation. Even if he did not learn calculus, he would be genius again, and there is no way to construct a spell model more simply than before, so that the advanced speed is a record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even if he is still indifferent and cold on the surface, can you want to see Derek, the author of these two books? Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers floated to Vicente: "It is Fernando, one of the authors of "Basics of Calculus."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is equally complex with the senses of the Magic Council. On the one hand, he resists the intention of the other party to integrate his "soul supreme" organization. On the other hand, he is quite grateful to the other party for sharing the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy" and The behavior of the Foundation of Calculus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can be seen." Vicente touched the storage bag in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is in the hidden forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small market that exchanges magical materials and spellbooks is in full swing, lively and hustle, Vicente and Congos pass by, stepping in The underground palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The appointment time is after half an hour." Congus sat behind his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente did not answer, and turned to Congers's bookshelf, took out a thick book and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time is very fast, and half an hour has passed without knowing it. At this time, the magician responsible for the hospitality walks with a bright lady. Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando?" Conggs asked indefinitely, it was such a flame-shining lady that was quite different from Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando nodded slightly: "I was recently stared at by the church's night watchman and had to change my mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the belt, the chest suddenly sag, the whole person became a handsome little man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente looked at this scene and said in a disgusting way: "Pervert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He is a normal person, and the boundaries between men and women are still very important. Even if there is a need for change, it is only a difference between a person and an appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando suddenly became angry: "At least you are more disgusting than people who see it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Vicente did not answer, disdain to argue with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snarled a few words and saw no response from the opposite side, so there was no motivation, so he turned to look at Congers: "I want to see the human body structure." And the author of the Theory of Circulation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers recently compiled the results of Vicenteâ€™s research into books and exchanged them for the Magic Council Douglas, Fernando, and Mystery. The latest research results of "Ms. Silver Grey". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers raised his palm and pointed to Vicente: "It is him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah?" Fernando, who has become an Archmage, noticed that Vicente, who is also a Master, is so young! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
