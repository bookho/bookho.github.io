			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have passed through the invisible quiet thick layer of cold curtains, and Lucien heard the sound of "squeaky" and then the body hit a hard object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first sound that Lucien heard after entering the world of locks, and "friendly" made him tinnitus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worried that the two ghouls were still behind their backs, Lucien, who was dizzy and fierce, did not hesitate, and the moonlighted and changed direction and rolled a few times on the ground. Then I waved a long sword and suddenly turned and jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword did not hit anything, it was a wide corridor, although it was still gray-black walls, pale carpet, no other colors But it seems to be softer and more vivid than the outside. It is no longer like a solid black and white photo, and even a little warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ghouls, following the passage of Lucien, seem to be uncomfortable with the shaking of the "curtain" and the environment that suppresses undead creatures here. Falling on the ground is struggling to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucien let this opportunity pass, stepping through the first few steps, "vigilant" swords flashing with pale cold light and being hit by "ice flying blades" The ghoul that had passed in was cut and aimed at the deep wound on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword is like a wood that has been wrapped in countless layers of animal skin, making a dull sound, but the neck of the ghoul is twice in a row. It has been opened for a long time, and his head is swaying, and it seems that it may fall at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left his hand and lifted it, the sulfur was thrown out, and there was no spell casting. The mental power was immediately evacuated for a small half, and a white wall of fire would have another meal. The ghoul is isolated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in front of the ghoul, he was hit by a heavy slamming, and Lucine stepped to adjust the position, alerting the sword to continually linger. Its neck is wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three hits, "Card", the ghoul's head was finally separated from the body, with a sticky, disgusting black corpse falling to the ground, and The body without the skull swung a few claws forward and smashed it completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of undead is not like ghosts of spirits such as wraiths, ghosts, etc. Physical damage to the physical connection can make them "quiet". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing this ghoul, Lucien resisted the feeling of nausea and slight paralysis, ran to the front of the corridor, and opened the ghoul behind the fire wall. Distance, then start fighting with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little faster speed and magical cooperation, Lucien spent a few minutes finally crushing his head and letting the rotten brain tissue spatter on both sides. Wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a formal knight, I may not be able to kill one, no intelligence is no intelligence." Lucien is in the "little girl" grievance He was injured in his hand, but he still hadn’t healed himself and stalked the ghouls for a long time. At this time, he was breathing heavily and he took time to recover. “But Palmier’s ice-blade effect will not be so. Poor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes of rest, after the "moonlight blood" restored most of the level, Lucien went to the front of the wreckage of two ghouls Reluctantly hold back the rancid smell that made you disgusted and peeled off their palms with a vigilant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the method of casting the second ring magic "Ghoul Touch", how can Lucien be wasted. Although this must be in contact with the other party to get the effect, but special occasions are still very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sulphur Fire Wall" reappeared, burning the two ghoul wrecks completely, and Lucien clasped the sword and proceeded cautiously along the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale carpets, gray-black walls, seemingly endless promenades and slightly reverberating footsteps, always give Lucien an illusion of walking in the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth is getting stronger and stronger, and there is a black door in front of it, which is still engraved with a special, incomplete twelve-star magic circle, the same It is one of the basic magic arrays of the "Great Cross Star". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out another tube of mercury and concentrated on the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gray-white desk on the window of the hall, with a black note on it. Outside the window, you can see all kinds of strange magical plants, with baby faces, and occasional bleeding. The sun is dazzling... Observing the terrain, making sure that the black door from the left hand side of the desk can enter the magic garden, Lucien slowly walks to the desk, all the way to concentrate on finding magic traps, etc. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing changed, Lucien arrived at the desk very smoothly, then turned the black notebook to the first page with a vigilant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale parchment is written in the dark ancient sylvanus magical empire text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Moonlight Rose in the No. 1 room No. 25 storage cabinet, urinium in the No. 1 room No. 72, giant thorn tree roots and sap in the No. 1 room No. 99 and No. 2 room No. 3, vampire blood in No. 3 Room No. 21, the banshee's teeth in No. 46 room No. 46, ... the leaves of the grimace in the No. 7 room No. 17, the petrified snake's feathers in the No. 7 room No. 92, the 'Shepherd' moon flower in the No. 8 room On the 8th, the stinking fisherman's lymph in the No. 9 room No. 1, ......... full of several pages are similar items, Lucien originally thought it was a record of material storage, but found with nine rooms eight hundred and eight Compared with eleven storage cabinets, only a small part of the records are recorded, and these materials can be used by themselves!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a refining "silver moon pharmacy" There is a refining "gate of magic" potion, there is a refining "cry soul" potion... "It seems to be specially written for me?" ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought in a faint thought, there was a picture in front of him. Nearly a thousand years ago, in this black and white room, there was a pale old man. Holding a quill, I was surprised to smile and wrote on the note in the rustling sand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing a few pages with the material storage location, the notes showed a lot of blanks. Often, there is only one sentence on one page. The black words and the pale background make Lucien look shocking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When doing the 'experiment', I happened to It is an interesting world to discover this strange world, which completely overlaps with the main material world, and confuses and irregularly projects the non-living things of the main world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......" After several explorations, you can be sure that this is a world that is very suitable for undead, such as wraiths, ghosts, etc., and it is so quiet, Such tedious, forever black and white gray will make the living person completely mad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compared to the skull of the abyss on the 133rd floor, and either filled with a sulphur flame, or a cold, bitter hell, this eternal silence The world is more like a country where the deceased sleeps. Please allow me to name it the 'dead world'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some guys seem to have discovered this too..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"In the dead In the depths of the world, I found a very interesting and dangerous place. It has a striking connection with some of our 'experiments' that I concentrated on. I have to invite those old friends to explore together, perhaps to solve the eternal Change the secret. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I started, I suddenly felt a strong uneasiness, so I made a prediction at great cost." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A friend who saw my notes, please allow me to call you "the unbelievers who walk between light and darkness", you probably got me. The book of Astrology and Elements, and follows the records of poetry and manuscripts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may still be tied there without completely dying, but I don't expect you to specialize in saving me, but after you enter the legendary field, I am afraid It will be attracted by the place where there are countless secrets. Please let me be free when I arrive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, even if you want to come now, I will advise you not to go deep into the realm of the dead, because there are many powerful undead creatures, even high-level magicians. The Archmage will also be very dangerous, and the place I mentioned is consistently considered by several old friends to be 'legendary restricted areas'. Oh, I still remember when I found out there were a few old-fashioned mummies' 'cheer' faces. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a nice morning crystal ball in the drawer on the left side of the desk, and the magic item I made in the drawer on the right side." Helping you to sense the gap between the main material world and the Necromancer in the middle of the night. These gaps are scattered but spread throughout the continent. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
