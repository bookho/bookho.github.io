			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lussien, Charlotte, and Sandra, who saw this inexplicable scene, sighed with relief because they expressed the "Beltralang" castle itself. The magical array has not been opened, indicating that the core part of the magician's castle has been destroyed when the summoning ceremony fails, or it is indeed a low-level devil through the summoning array. The intelligence is not enough, and the magic knowledge is not known. Vertical magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is possible, this is good news for Lucien and others, because a fully inspired magic tower or magician castle often means If the master has one or two levels of strength, if the magician inherits which high-level one, it is not impossible to rely on the magic tower to temporarily resist the six-ring and seven-ring magicians, so this is a three-ring. If the castle designed and built by the magician Bertrand completely opens the magic array, it will be equivalent to a four-ring, five-ring magician. It takes a long time to break the road, Charlotte and Sandra. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien did not immediately rush in, but stopped in the air outside the castle, pushed the single glasses, and the left eye blocked by it became Red and red, through the partially open castle window looking at the dark scene inside, from time to time can find the red light of huge heat radiation - from hell, most of the devils growing in the sulfur flame, immune flames and toxins, the infrared radiation is Far more than ordinary humans, sometimes even with thick walls blocking and absorbing, it can make Lucien barely find a trace of red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the conclusions drawn by Charlotte and Sandra using their respective investigative methods, Lucien’s mind is likely to show a low-level devil. The topographic map of the castles in the scope of their activities, combined with Susan’s description of the environment, quickly made a preliminary decision, calmly saying to the other two: “We first need to destroy the summoning array and then clean up the remaining devils. According to this idea, we can't go out through the windows or directly blasting the walls of the castle. It is easier to go through the gates, courtyards, and hall stairs to the second floor and away from the window."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I think so too, Mr. Evans." Charlotte features identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sandra’s hand slammed into a flash of lightning, condensed into a silver-white electric light spear and flew straight through the gate, falling into the corner of the courtyard. In the darkness of the bottom, a dazzling electric light and a slight explosion sounded, which is an energy well that draws the power of the sun and the tide to maintain the normal operation of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an opportunity for the magic array to be unlocked, destroying one of the energy wells so that they are blocked by the magic array after entering the castle - even though most of the magic towers are arranged Both are stronger than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are many similar energy wells in the castle. They all converge to the energy of the third floor. Only when they are completely destroyed can the castle be destroyed. Most of the magic array inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the well, a faint black glow with countless magical runes emerges, struggling to resist the bursting of silver electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sandra is ready to condense a four-ring "Thunder Spear" attack, he suddenly sees Lucien extending his right hand and condensing his palm A different red fireball from the ordinary, the size of the skull, the color is restrained, it seems to contain the power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien’s right hand push, the red fireball slammed out and quickly hit the energy well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang, completely out of the explosions that Charlotte and Sandra expected, and there were countless black smokes in the field, they vacated. Formed a small mushroom cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black smoke disappeared, the broken energy well appeared in front of Sandra and others, which made her open her mouth and could not speak, pure explosion and Destruction is really the strength of the elemental system, and it is worthy of the title of “destructive madness”! It’s just that the magical power of Mr. Evans is too exaggerated. It does not know how many times more than the three-ring fireball, and can even rival the "large flames" of the five rings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the elemental will or the unique magic of Mr. Evans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can she and Charlotte be standing next to Lucien? It’s impossible to tell if this is the magic that the magic item fires or the magic that it releases, and Lucy. Yep? Evans has only three levels of magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after seeing this magic, they have no doubt about Lucian’s magical power, at least in terms of mere destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xi'an's big fireball" is mainly based on explosion damage, supplemented by flame burning, which is equivalent to the elemental explosion of the four rings. More importantly, Lu Xi's Holm crown ring "element" is still It can increase its power by 40%, so it looks like a horror of five rings of magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien’s original mental power can continuously display more than 20 large fireballs, but with the super-magic skill “False Increases Far”, only Can release seven or eight, but the "element" ring makes Lucien's mental recovery speed up to the level of the five-ring magician, as long as there is no continuous use of the rest of the spell space, there is basically no half-hour battle. The danger of mental exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be said that the "element" ring is an artifact compared to the level of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of magic, Charlotte and Sandra did not oppose Lucian’s decision, and quickly landed in the castle courtyard with Susan. At the same time, she was given the "acceleration" and "bear bear" magic, so that she can keep up with the three mid-level magicians who have superimposed these magic gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, Charlotte and Sandra stood in front of each other, behind Lucien, this is the standard magic parliament three fights Formal, while Susan followed Lucian, behind Sandra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground floor of the courtyard can see the blood stains of the splash from time to time, and at this time there are evil screams in the castle. Obviously the low-level devils have discovered the enemy invasion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly passing through the courtyard, a fireball from Charlotte directly blasted the iron door in the hall, and then rushed in with Sandra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, an incomplete human corpse lay flat, their faces are full of lingering fear, broken limbs, heart Intestines and so on can be seen everywhere. The rich bloody smell and nightmare scene make Susan almost retching and soft feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly discerning the direction, several people began to traverse the burning sofa, chair, wood, etc., stepping on the stairs with blood and meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black carved stair in the smoky smog appeared in the corner, and Susan couldn’t help but feel a little excited, but she found some joy on her face, but suddenly there was a flaw. The sound of the humming sound, a group of bloated "Wasps" carved out of obsidian flew from different walkways, they are huge, equivalent to two or three humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike ordinary wasps, their heads are like a human female surname with a white pupil, her expression is full of pain, and her head has short tentacles. The jaw is twisted into a straw, and the back has a pair of flexible black wings, and at the end of the body there is a spike that shines with black light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these "Wasps" used their horrible female surnames, Susan screamed like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien, Charlotte, and Sandra have not been affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Tiger Bee", from which there are no yellow, red or orange stripes to judge just low order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick, bright lightning emerged out of thin air, squatting in a slap in the face of Sandra’s mind, cuddling her with a huge body and injecting toxins The tiger bee is on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, this tiger bee is coke-like, and tiny electric light pops up from it, hitting other tiger bees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the lightning-sucking convulsions were in place, and only a few in the distance were unaffected, continuing to madly cast a fire attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bitter cold wind mixed with diffuse snowflakes whistling near the stairs, which quickly solidified the size of the fist, the hail of the cold ice, and many tigers The bee demon freezes into ice and is fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-ring magic "ice storm" comes from Charlotte! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the devils are immune to common flames and toxins, they are resistant to acid and cold but not strong, so the combat experience is rich and neither Charlotte nor Sandra Choose flame magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
