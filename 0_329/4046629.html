			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the call with Natasha, Lucien did not clean up his room and lab like other single men, so that "Queen Her Majesty" Visit, not to mention the Leo butler, more than a dozen servants, a Mithril Golem and a few steel golems to drive, just the towering "Pinocchi" can make the entire magic tower An angle is clean and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Lucien himself is a very organized person, and all kinds of things, especially experimental materials, are placed strictly in the original way, with obvious The law, so as not to be mistaken when focusing on the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the mind, Lucien pays attention to the shackles. In the past few days, he has cracked the last two layers of seals and completely mastered this. A nine-level item close to the legendary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penultimate seal is of little value, just to let Lucien use the nine-level magic "undead natural enemies", but the last layer of seals Contains the mysterious geographical coordinate transformation law of Muskillin's record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious place is located in the depths of the dead spirit, and seems to have an inseparable relationship with the origins of high-order undead such as Ador. It is probably the mystery of the dead world. There is a "palace" that is asleep waiting for recovery, and may contain the greatest secret of the dead spirit that Rhine refers to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information left by Muskilllin contains more than a dozen parameters, which are closely related to the specific circumstances of the Necromancer, and only truly enter the realm of the dead. In the depths, you can calculate the mysterious place of changing position by obtaining real-time environmental data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have become a legendary magician, and it is time to explore the secrets of the Necromancers and rescue Mr. Muskilllin from the plan." The harvest in the cross-frame puzzle is the basis for Lucian's true growth. Without the deliberate legacy of Maskillin, the person without the strength of the official magician is likely to have died on his journey to Stewart. The arcane master who explores the world and studies the mysteries as the goal of life will sooner or later have a trip to the world of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Lucien didn’t plan to go forward recently, and he had to wait until the six legendary magics were engraved in the soul, and it’s better to have a legend. The third-order or peak-level, and "group" by the Magic Council, this is the safest way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After two days to apply for information from Ms. Helen, my authority is sufficient to obtain the information extracted from the souls of high-order undead creatures such as Ador. ..." After Lucine had made a decision, he did not entangle himself with this matter, and began to concentrate on the study of "time and space scepter" and analyze "revenge gaze." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Lucien came to the Allinge Magic Tower The thirty-third floor, waiting outside the study of Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the time and space fluctuations in the study room, the familiar atmosphere was introduced to the nose of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent, the door opened, a tall lady came out, Natasha dressed in a white safari and trousers, stepping on brown Long riding boots, slanting on the head wearing a black knight hat, clean and cool, and such dressing is very compatible with her temperament and appearance, except for a slight surname, it is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s slightest glance, Natasha proudly pressed his chest with his right hand and said slightly: “Hello, you are the truth of the element, "The scepter of the time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms., you are my truth." Lucian answered humorously, and there was a little regret in his heart. A lot higher, compared to Natasha, it is still a few centimeters shorter, especially the short legs, but fortunately it is not too obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and stood by Lucien, looking around at the Allinge Magic Tower when she was a child: "It's more beautiful than I remember." The overall minimalist design and silvery icy luster, ubiquitous mysterious patterns and other details constitute an unspeakable fantasy style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So every A magician or apprentice will always leave an indelible impression after seeing the Allinge Magic Tower for the first time, giving himself the goal of being stunned, and your knight will take you to visit the Institute of Atomic Studies." Lucien stretched out his right hand and made an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha chuckled: "This is the mysterious forbidden zone that all nobles and citizens are discussing. It seems to hide the deepest secrets of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there was no external pressure and danger, Natasha was very relaxed and unhappy, and she followed Lu Xien all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two consecutive laughter alarmed Helen, who was on duty at this level. She opened the door of the study and frowned slightly: "She is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha has no magic and arcane badges on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is my fiancée Natasha, the Queen of Holm Kingdom, Ms. Helen, should you have seen it?" Lucien introduced, and at the same time Doubt, Helen should not know Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is also very polite: "His Helen, I often hear from Hathaway, you are one of the ladies I admire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen’s frowning brow stretched out: “You’re Natasha, I’ve seen your image, and I’ve heard your name, but I’ve never been in touch. Together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tried to hold back the smile, and Ms. Helen apparently did not focus on this aspect, so that this problem occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since confirming the identity of the visitor, Helen has no time to chill, directly close the door of the study, and continue to indulge in his own arcane world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Herren’s appearance is the most exquisite of the female names I have ever seen." Natasha smiled and sighed as she stepped onto the lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien’s mouth smacked: “How do you care about her appearance...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't you care about this?" Natasha felt that this was a matter of course, and then smiled. "Reassured, I can be loyal and loyal, appreciate and appreciate, there will be no other ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien touched the hair behind the Natasha Knight's Cap without words, and the direction he needs to worry about is different from normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stands on the edge of the lift and points to the 31st floor: "Is the Sky Radio station inside? I really like the Lark and the Nightingale." The voice of the woman, do not know how their real people look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, Natasha asked similar words, but then Lucien worried Adding love to yourself and perfunctory the past with other excuses. Anyway, Louise was a little famous musician when he was in Aalto, and he was not qualified enough to be concerned by Natasha, the Viking Countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the daytime, they are not in the sky radio station," Lu Xien explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity, but I will stay in Allinge tonight, can I take the Sky Radio station?” Natasha is very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship has been confirmed, Lucien naturally will no longer have the fear of the past, smiled and said: "Okay, I still hang the director of the sky radio station. Title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, I have long been known as Lucien The meeting of Lazar, Heidi, Ophelia and others were excited and anxiously waiting. Although they all saw the portrait of the Queen in newspapers and magazines, they never met face to face with her real person, let alone this is Lucy. Yep? Lord Evans publicly ends the sign of the single. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, the entrance to the institute opened, and Heidi’s eyes saw the teacher side by side with a heroic, clean and free purple hair lady. In. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True beauty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder teachers will like her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a perfect match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The whispering apologizes constantly, Natasha's temperament and image are very much in line with the taste of the woman present, she thinks that she has a British beauty, different from all female surname magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien giving a light cough, Katrina and other students returned to God and respectfully bowed: "Good morning, teacher, good morning, Her Majesty the Queen." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Lucien introduced Lazar, Jerome and other friends, Annick, Lei Yi Li Ya and other students to Natasha, and they chilled a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the assistants spread out, Heidi saw Natasha cheerful and generous, so he took the courage to ask: "His Majesty, what is your emotional experience with the teacher?" The entire Ariel's magician is very curious!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Directly, you are curious, cute little girl." Natasha smiles and laughs. Looking at Heidi and other students, "In short, I pushed your teacher down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Heidi, Reyia almost spewed out Saliva, have cocked their thumbs, really domineering! Dealing with the gentle and restrained men of the teacher, direct decisive seems to be the best way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be very free." Lucien interjected, "I will assign you a task to study the computational principles of the auxiliary computing matrix."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and other students’ faces suddenly became bitter, the teacher was angry and angry, and there was another task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to know the process from start to finish, you will be free to tell you later." Natasha smiled and followed Lucian to the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door of the laboratory, Natasha saw the smooth lines inside which outlined a sharp and cold alchemy device that could not be described on the experimental platform. The secret pattern is full of deep and mysterious taste. Although this style is cold, it does not make people feel ruthless. Instead, it has a great shock and a sense of eternal change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s totally different from my mother’s lab, there is one, one, the beauty of the stars.” Natasha was shocked and tried to find adjectives. Express your own senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the charm of arcane and magic, come and try this electromagnetic cyclotron." Lucien shared his research life with Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After starting the electromagnetic cyclotron with the will, Natasha saw a wonderful dreamy electronic trajectory in the cloud room, and exclaimed: "Is this a small electronic?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien just had to answer, hey, the voltage portion of the electromagnetic cyclotron suddenly broke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s none of my business..." Natasha thinks she has no extra work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien checked: "It is the normal surname damage, come, try this magnifying magic array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Natasha once again said innocently: "This is really not my business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, also the normal name is damaged ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took Natasha and tried a circle, broke three alchemy devices and two magic arrays, although less than a percentage One, but also reached the usual one month damage amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they are afraid of me?" Natasha squinted at her chin, her eyes were "serious" and she sought excuses for this anomaly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said with a funny smile: "If you don't have a long time, you will have a nickname, 'Experimental device destroyer'."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is definitely a bad day for the stars!" Natasha was arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien visited Nalta with Natasha The center area is circled and does not return to the magic tower until noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This style is more starry and fanciful than the atomic laboratory...you design it." Natasha was once again by Lucien "Babel Tower" was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you, the hostess." "Pinocchio" came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is curious about the wisdom of alchemy life, looking at Lucien: "Don't you teach?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
