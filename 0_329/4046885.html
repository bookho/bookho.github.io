			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy?" The skinny Vicente looked at Lucien, the deep voice was hard to cover, and the two dark red flames were fierce. The ground beats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there are no red blood, white brains and shattered skulls, this will cause most arcane masters to collapse their worldviews and stagnate for a long time. What are the benefits? Do you satisfy your perverted hobby? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the top members of the top panel did not say anything, but their eyes and expressions showed that their ideas were consistent with the "death soul" Vicente. Too crazy, will the results of the experiments that I am afraid of facing others will be broadcast to all the Arcans? In fact, you are really "falling morning star", right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien maintains a gentleman’s courtesy smile: “Long-term stagnation does not mean that there is never a chance to be promoted, as long as it is really based on experiment and mathematics. And exploring the world, sooner or later, will reshape the world view and find its own path, and will not leave too serious hidden dangers for the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If this does not endanger The experiments of life are not dare to face, how can they explore the fields that may subvert common sense in the future? If the views of the microscopic field are not yet internalized into the components of their cognitive world, let them undergo the baptism of experiments and understand what Is it the wonder of the microcosm, correcting their thoughts, is it necessary to wait until they unwittingly turn into the structure of their own cognitive world after they have been promoted again and again, and then slowly give experimental results? Even if it is better, The results of the experiment are in line with the common sense of most people, and by then there will be people who will burst their heads or cognize the world of broken solidification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas vs. Lucien The words are more agreeable, but there are also some concerns: "Will the live broadcast be too urgent, or wait until we verify what happens and then consider what form to tell other arcane masters."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a baptism for them. In the past they were always under our protection, and they didn't know enough about the 'cruel' of arcane research. Since there is no life threatening, let them face it. This kind of shock will also accumulate some experience in the future. When faced with the subversive theory again, it can be treated with more arcane and more objective attitude, and the risk of headshot is minimized.” Lucien has always maintained a gentle smile. The people who are familiar with him, such as Konatha, have faintly noticed a bit of bad taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason is right..." Hathaway and Helen nodded in agreement with Lucien, but they always felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued: "In addition, I think other forces will not be able to bear to watch this live broadcast, and this time the experiment is simple and clear. Containing the truth of the world, it is equally likely to have a great impact on them, so let them feel the torrent of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Viken Directly falling under the experimental results, the two experiments you envisioned are the most classic experiments in history.” Oliver, the playwright’s thinking is very jumping, and he is full of creative passion when he thinks about the scenes described in his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the most recognized arcane and magic experiment is the electronic double-slit interference experiment completed by Lucien. The idea is clear and simple, although the experimental device is difficult to make, It is not complicated, and the results are incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas couldn’t help but smile: "Most of the arcane masters grew up under your repeated subversive theoretical shocks. The resistance to these two experiments is far stronger than those first witnessed by the first time. Maybe there will be strong people who can't stand it, the world view completely collapses, and then doubt the life, doubt the self, and no longer can go any further." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that you are not just referring to Lucien, the archer and some of the legendary magicians present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando used the usual poison tongue: "Because the arcane masters who cannot withstand the blows have either died or have been eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas converges on a smile, very serious: "I am very curious about these two experiments. The first thought after becoming a god is that I can explore their results. This must contain the most essential secrets of the world. I don’t know if you have any feelings. The state of the gods I describe is in line with the theory of wave-particle duality. Particles and waves are unified at a higher level, but in our In observation, only one side is presented, so exploring the mystery of quantum is the secret of studying the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the initial establishment of the quantum field theory describing electromagnetic force, his cognitive world of broken solidification has begun to regain its vitality. Only by solving the problem of infinity, he can completely "heal" and find his own path of the god-like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then live." Douglas nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than half a month, just returned from the 830 New Year holiday The students of the third general school suddenly got the notice. They didn’t have to take classes this morning. They all concentrated on the square with the live screen and watched the live broadcast of the arcane experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Australian experiment live? What arc experiment?" After more than two years of getting along, Ali and his classmates gradually became familiar with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad leader Charlotte, who was asked by him, spread his hands and said that he did not know: "Maybe the high-level arcian who invited the satellite live channel came. Experimenting on the spot, so the school organized us to watch, learn the normative experimental operation process, and understand the significance of the arcane experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the squad leader, I don’t know. Said so much, but also very written language, Ali secretly admire, the next live broadcast is both curious and full of interest, this ordinary person who has not even started the magic apprentice, I am afraid that this life does not know whether there is still A second chance to see a high-level Arcanist experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the development of Arcane, thanks to the artificial planet invented by Douglas and Evans, thanks to the rapid development of electromagnetic communication, thanks to Ms. Heidi for creating on the live screen. The indelible contribution made in the process... Otherwise, not to say the second time, I don’t even think about it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery is on, this is the charm of arcane and magic, this is the change they bring, Ali habitually painted a cross, expressing his own thanksgiving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aringe, in Rentatt, in Cox, in a city where all the Magic Council branches are opened, a free magician I looked at the live screen with suspicion and didn't understand what the arcane experiment would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Heidi’s personally produced small live broadcast screen is glowing with waves, waiting for the signal to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the experiment?" Annick is very interested in this kind of arcane field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi licked his mouth: "I have a bad feeling. If I wait to see the teacher in the live broadcast, then we will be the first live broadcast screen. Blow up, otherwise it will not be it, but our head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd laughed and understood that Heidi is in an exaggerated language Expressing speculation and a little uneasiness in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the current sound of Zizz sounded, the screen gradually became clear, and a room full of experimental devices appeared, showing a kindness in a tuxedo. The old man and a handsome young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really a teacher!" Heidi’s fists clenched, but did not blow up the live screen according to the previous words, but looked at it with full concentration. The picture, waiting for the beginning of the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experiment is definitely very important, otherwise the teacher will not choose this form of live broadcast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane explored the world’s “instinct” to overcome her little fear and looked forward to the experiment, and around her, Annick, Sprint, The same is true of Katrina and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of the Speaker?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of Evans?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exclaiming in the Allinge Magic Tower, in the tower, in the headquarters of the will, in all places where you can see the live broadcast, it is actually the Speaker of the House and Lord Evans. Conduct an experimental live broadcast? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mentioned the eyes of the blind, curiously expecting and fearing panic, the Lord’s Excellency is nothing, and the "record" of Evans is too brilliant. People are crying from the heart and fear. For example, in a drama about the Arcanist, there is a popular line: "Is my head still there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
