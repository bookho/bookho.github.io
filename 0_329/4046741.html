			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent wind blew, and the gravel above the bloody plain was once again immersed in the air, sloppy, infinite, letting the sun shine slightly through the thick dust. Returning to dark red, a wild dog with three heads dragged its tail from afar, feeding on the dead demons, and slowly growing scales on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have red eyes and swallowed the body like a game, and even the bones were chewed and swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante opened his eyes and looked at the scene. The voice was soft and affectionate: "Is it into the abyss now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the action plans of Lucien, Natasha, and Malfurion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario simply cooperates with Lucien to prevent sudden changes in the inside, so that the relationship between the Magic Council and the Elf is worse, so there is no answer, doping A hint of green pupils looked at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Alum goes into the abyss and stays in the unknown town today to see if you can find the problem."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he smiled: "The entry into the abyss survey is a relatively backward choice. It should not be abyss if it has not been carefully searched and examined for four weeks. Goal. If the source is really here? I don't want to waste time, especially because of my own negligence and wasting time and doing things step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Very good, the next time let us focus on finding the odds of the unnamed town and the nearby area." Atlante quite agrees with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion has no opinion at all, and Lanhill and Celine, who feel the power of "eternal blaze", are quite silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When flying to the town of the unnamed, Natasha asked through the spiritual connection: "Why do you want to go to the abyss? No need to take risks... If you want to help I am looking for a chance to fight, waiting for the demon kings to attack in the town of the unknown, and there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that Lucien is not the kind of It is quite doubtful that people are prioritized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'space fusion' is quite similar to one of my ideas, so I hope to thoroughly study it and maybe find some 'things'." Sean explained one sentence, looking back at the gap in the abyss, shaking his head and talking to himself in the mind line, "'Space integration'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha sees that Lucien has his own purpose, so he nods, no more to say, feels that every cell is uplifting, eager to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason and Fred are squatting back and forth on the street, surrounded by equally anxious waiters who can’t wait to get out of here and don’t want to be The victim of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, stand, you hit me!" In such an atmosphere, a big man suddenly screamed, his bald head had a tangled leaf The cyan pattern is one of the totems of the barbarian in the southern end of the Dark Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man who was screaming at him was carrying a short bow, and his right hand clasped a blue dagger with a chill of chill, and his emotions rose a little out of control. "The barbarian, close your mouth, this is not the place to play tricks, otherwise I don't mind letting you taste the taste of freezing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because just now The turmoil caused by the eternal blazing sun, the streets that are not wide are crowded with adventurers, and it is inevitable that they will collide with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! You must apologize to me, or else I will make you a nameless person!" Barbarian popularity is violent, two-meter-high body blocks The muscles bulged, with a layer of bronzed deep luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the two are about to fight, a Knight’s right hand turns into a flame, squatting between them from top to bottom, causing the earth to split into a blackened Gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet!" The knight's icy golden eyes swept the two knight-level adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason, who witnessed all this, sighed: "It has been blocked for a long time, and it has experienced the demonic tide and the death of many adventurers. Everyone’s emotions seem to be more and more violent and anxious. Blood case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even his own, there is a similar irritability and painful feeling, want to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid gently took a breath and tried to criticize the elf's inefficiency. The "eternal blaze" has not been lifted for a long time. At this time, he suddenly looked up and felt a strange change in the sky above the town. "It's down, low, depressed, dim!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the sky is half bright, there is a fascinating light in it, sometimes it’s dark, like a human heart, and the other half is coming. The more bleak, the more and more low, and finally, the blood fades, leaving only the deepest and deepest darkness, the boundless darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this darkness, there is a little bit of star-like flickering, fascinating and colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the scene of this vast abyss as if it were a starry sky, looking at the scene of this annihilation is like a human heart, Ferred is in a state of disappointment, the soul is floating, There is no other perception for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the cool breeze with bloody smell, Ferred slammed a chill and saw the sky return to normal The diffuse dust still blocks the sunlight, no, not the sun, but the silver moonlight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it just an illusion..." Freder turned his head and found that Mason and others stood there all the stone statues, and the whole town of the unknown was surprisingly quiet. Even the estrus dog in the "Bone Bones" bar did not make a roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a half-plane projection, the half-face of the legendary magician..." Mason also returned to God, as if the answer seemed to be self-talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some rituals that help the knight to temper the blood. It is necessary to communicate and summon the power of the legendary plane, just as the promotion of the clergy in the truth god must communicate and summon the Lord. ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid laughed and laughed at himself: "This is the first time I have seen a legendary plane, not a 'stained plain'."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord of the blood-colored plain, "Bloody King" is a legendary second-order demon. If a magician, a cult, a special bloody knight holds a blood, killing ritual, It may summon the power of the "blood plain", so it is also a legendary plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two legendary mages of the parliament have finally checked." Mason has a heartfelt exhaustion, and at this time, has entered the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a growing number of polluted forests outside the town of the unknown Trees that violate normal laws, they bend indeliberately, as if they were mischievous by children, there is a tumor on the bark, with bloody stains, and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a forest that is polluted too close to the abyss, but it gradually weakens after a hundred meters, and it is almost normal at 200 meters. It's hard to take on the need for 'space blending'.” “Hands of Balance” Loder introduces the only place in the neighborhood that is likely to be in harmony with the abyss parameters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked closely for a while, checked it again with magic, and nodded: "It can be confirmed that this has nothing to do with the expansion of the abyss gap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante also gave similar conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I really want to go to the abyss." Malfurion is not willing to go in, "Abyss will" is a kind of madman. No one knows what He wants to do next, because he does not know Himself! If He could not think of it, he would blew himself in front of himself and others. What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more worried about the abyss will without the brain than the infernal Lord of conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Space integration' is still in its infancy, basically between the Scarlet Plain and Stroop Forest, which is affected by the abyss and is also dominated by the main material world. Suppressed, the will of the wounded abyss is almost impossible to fall on the bloody plain, just as He can't directly fall into the main world." Lucien explained to Malfurion, this is the processing experience of the ancient magic empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
