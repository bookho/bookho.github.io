			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. X? Oh, it’s like the mysterious and evil villain." After being familiar with Lucien, Lazar showed more enthusiasm and talk. Unconventional surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "When I made a big event that alerted the entire magical world, I left a bloody X letter on the scene." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloody X-letter? It feels great! But why always reminds me of the words left by the professor who killed the traitor in the purification sequence, It’s really fascinating and cold.” Lazar was intoxicated by himself, and he didn’t pay attention to his friends’ faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time passed, the reason why the professor was going to clean up the sequence was to spread a little, especially the Rogerio sent by the Magic Council still lived in Aalto. After a period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh." Lucien laughed twice and quickly shifted the subject to discuss the famous Alchemist shop in Alinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the talk, the two soon arrived at the "Magician Management Department", this time Lucien successfully activated the Arcane Badge, dark black background There is a faint glow, and there are seven silver dots flashing on it, deep mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This badge is mainly for recording names, arcane points and arcane levels. There is no other magic effect, but according to Lazar, it becomes a middle-level arcane. After the division, this badge will be constant with a magic effect, and once again at a high level, the same is true for similar magic badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, do you decide to add an X to your name?" Eric watched Lucien wearing the arcane badge on his left chest while serious Asked, Lazar had already called Mr. X a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Zheng focuses on: "Yes, Mr. Eric, what else do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Nothing, just remind you, arrange your life and residence for a while as soon as possible, then come to me to leave a contact address and method. Yes, when you reply to the invitation of the "General Oralist Monthly" It is best to attach them together. Maybe you will always contact them later. Please come in, the door is not locked." Eric snorted a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, someone was knocking at the door of Eric’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Eric is still busy, Lucian and Lazar quickly quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Eric seems to be very busy..." Lucian looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar seems to have heard a joke, haha ​​said: "Because he only works for two days and fourteen hours a week, the rest is to learn magic, The time for the magic experiment. And the reward is very rich, there are 30 Jintal or Arcane points income in a month, it does not affect the usual task of receiving tasks, inventing magic and so on."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ten deacons of the Magician Management Department are so envious of doing things, it is really enviable, but unfortunately it is the welfare of the middle-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is born with envy: "There is less time to do things, more rewards, and it seems to be close to home. It is a perfect job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If the parliament does not arrange this way, there are not many middle-level magicians who are willing to do such cumbersome and not very high-level management work. After all, the main thing of the magician is to learn magic and arcane and improve their strength. Only Those who do not hope to progress will be obsessed with the accumulation of wealth." Lazar Young, vigorous when it is naturally despise the kind of decadent decadent give up hope magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression became serious: "Right, Lucien, have you considered what you will do in the future? It is peace of mind to experiment and learn magic. Fundamentals, or adventure, complete tasks to get a lot of wealth, then buy magic items, exchange pharmacy, materials, etc. to enhance strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really study and conduct magic Experiment.” Lu Xien has lived in a depressed state for more than a year, and has experienced many dangers. He is not in the mood to take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar regained his normal smile: "Then I suggest that you wait for the magic school to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar smirked: "First of all, your coaching task can only be completed in half. Then you can choose to teach two formal magic apprentices to become high-level and pass the 'apprentice assessment department' routine investigation, but this one of you There won't be a reward for the copper fair. You can also choose the work of the magic school, which not only has a salary, but also has six apprentices in the magic class that teaches it, even if it is a high-level task, it is very easy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I remember Lucien, you only have sixty Jintales and nine arcane points?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes." Lucien nodded honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar gently patted the palm of his hand: "Although this money is a wealth that ordinary civilians can't afford for a lifetime, but to the magician In fact, it is a stone thrown into the sea, and it can't splash a lot of waves. As long as you want to acquire more knowledge and master stronger power, the magician is definitely the most expensive occupation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you need money to borrow books from the library, renting a 'assisted meditation room' needs money, and when experimenting with magic, both the lab and the materials need money, over and over again. It takes money to parse and release the magic. It is only necessary to pay for the regular needs. Sixty Jintales can probably use it for half a year. And when you upgrade your level, the materials you need will become more precious. At that time, you may have a magic experiment. A summoning attempt will consume sixty Jintales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently jaws: "I have heard a sentence, not enough Wealth cannot be a good magician. Fortunately, the magician Being able to get money by strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So in addition to receiving missions, taking risks, refining magical items to gain wealth, the Parliament also provides two ways, one is The higher the level of arcane and magic, the cheaper it is to buy materials from the parliament and rent a lab, and the high-level papers are rich in arcane rewards, and the invented new magic is exchanged for the arcane point, enough for strengths The Arcanist who explored the research deducted the magical consumption and lived a life of luxury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar seems to envy this arcane master, "Additional One is the combination of several Arcans and magicians to propose a study of arcane or magic in a certain field. If approved by the Parliament's Magic Research Committee, not only will magic laboratories and alchemy devices be provided free of charge. Also directly give a large number of arcane points, but unfortunately most of the research projects are led by high-ranking arcans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien could not help but pull Pulling the corner of the mouth, silently thought: "This is what will make me later The rhythm of funding?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For our first-time magician, if you don’t want to explore and don’t want to take on more dangerous tasks, then you have a good teacher. Follow the study and experiment with magic, or just find a good thing to do. And to the magic school is the favorite choice of the first-class magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zal screamed twice. "If you are a teacher at the Magic School, you only need ten classes for twenty hours a week, and the rest of the time is arranged by yourself. Although there are only ten Olympic points in a month's salary, Lucien you have to remember that the magic learning laboratory, the teacher can use it free of charge, the school's basic library, the teacher can read for free, and guide the apprentices to do the experiment materials. It is also provided free of charge by the school..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So good job, what can I win?" Honestly, Lucien was moved, especially when he heard that the Magic Lab and the Basic Library were free. How much money can you save? Lucien has always been a bit of a fan.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar took a shot of Lucien’s shoulder: “On the first day, you will get seven Arcane points, based on the evaluation of the word “create a surname” on your arcane thesis. Hehe, although the council has a ‘Support for Remote Magic School Mission’, it calls on low-level magicians to be teachers in several remote schools in the remote county, but I think you should not want to leave Allinge in a short time? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I can try to enter the five magic schools in Allinge." "Lu Xien did not expect to take the nickname of "Professor", he actually went to be a magic teacher, really "come to each other", "Right, Lazar, is there a mandate for the parliament? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien remembered the pale hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, one each year." But in the low-level, only the guiding task is to force the surname. After all, the parliament hopes that we can learn magic with peace of mind and grow up as soon as possible. After becoming a middle-level magician, if the task is too dangerous relative to its own strength, it can be exchanged for a new task after paying a certain price. "Lazar has no opinion on this, because there is no task that must be forced to go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-zone "task area" consists of silver-gray metal counters, each with a dark green magic water curtain behind it. Each task is issued by a parliament, submitted by a magician, and published by aristocrats or businessmen. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; four weeks Lucien Lazare and looked around, only to see a counter that no one before, so went over, <br /> <br /> & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the counter is a normal middle-aged lady, she asked coldly: "Are you taking the task, or handing in the task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Submit the completion of the mission." Lucien handed the documentary and the magic badge presented by the Apprentice Assessment Department to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman took the file and looked at it, wrote a few words on it, and then placed it with the magic badge on the right side of the silver-gray counter. On the lineup, he pulled the rope and sounded the familiar ringtone and silvery light of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light disappears, there is a piece of parchment inside the magic array - in order to transmit within the magical array, you must use magical specially treated parchment. Not ordinary white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged lady took a look and looked cold and honest: "Lusien Evans, half of the mission, you are next to the individual to guide the election The apprentice, or accept the 'Support for the remote magic school mission?'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that she took out the books of the basics of arcane and magic that seemed to be ready at any time. Thick and thick piled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to apply to enter one of the five magic schools in Allinge." Lucien answered politely. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> middle-aged woman Eyes of a challenge, Leng Heng said:. "Do not waste my time, please make a choice" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the council forbidding me to apply for five magic schools in Aringe?" Lucien saw her bad attitude, but still kept calm and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged woman leaned away and looked at Sean: "No. But you are an ancient inheritor of magic, and only came to Parliament yesterday, so I think you are wasting Time. Even if there is a formal arcane level, I don't want to enter the five magic schools in Allinge. What do you apply for? Please choose the task as soon as possible, otherwise I will complain to the 'Magic Management Department' that you disturb the mission area. "Run order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since there is no ban, you refuse to apply for Lucien, I will complain to the 'Committee' that you violated the 'Task Area Management Law '." Lazar screamed that his passionate and kind people were irritated by his arrogant attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lazar’s familiarity with the regulations is not like the ancient heritage of the magician who just came, and Lucien is also seriously looking at the level of his left chest. The Arcanist, the Second Ring Magician badge and the task area management nameplate, the middle-aged woman "Lloyd" angrily said: "Since you have to waste time, then waste it. Kindly remind you that you still don't know gratitude."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she took out a document from the counter and handed it to Lucien with the quill, urging him to fill it out quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above are name, age, magician level, arcane level, good at magical factions and approved papers, new magic, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about it. After completing the previous items, he also transcribed the specific evaluation of his paper. If you want to fight, you can’t neglect if The gentleman who reviewed this document just looked at the name of the paper and did not go to the evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurrying a few times, the middle-aged woman, Lloyd, took the road to Lucien’s paper with a stunned look. When she looked closely, the expression suddenly became dark: Is this true? If you are guilty, you will be severely punished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can check my arcane badge." Lucien faces the facelessly The badge was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lloyd looked at the seven silver dots with a black face, then put the file and the two badges together into the magic array, pulling the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she half closed her eyes and seemed to be praying for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
