			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, in the luxurious bedroom of the manor house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s father squinted back and forth, complaining to Shirley’s mother: “It’s a good idea for you! Say what you agree to, Let the low-lying boy begin to contact the aristocratic circle, attack his confidence, and let him take the initiative to leave Shirley. As a result, he is even tighter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Who knows that he is so shameless!" Shirley's mother was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s father snorted: “The world you have seen is too little, and you don’t understand humanity at all. This poor boy just wants to become a nobleman through marriage. The more we show, the more eager he is, how can he leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know! You know everything! Then you agree with me. The idea, but also promised a marriage contract?" Shirley's mother sharply shouted, "You can say, can you have any solution? Shirley is like being controlled by the magic, how to persuade not to listen! Also threaten me with life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley’s father’s expression became cold and he snorted: “I certainly have a way. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's mother snorted: "Do you have a solution?" any solution? Why don't you say it earlier? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions exposed her panicked and resentful heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am looking for someone to observe After this kid, he is very interested in herbalism and pharmacy blending, and often goes to the swamp to find exotic herbs. "Shirley's father was cold with a face and raised his right hand. "After a while, find a mercenary to follow him to the swamp, then, click..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He made a gesture of pinching his throat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You want to kill him? Are you not afraid that Shirley hates us for a lifetime? Not afraid of her suicide? She often threatens us with life! "Shirley's mother asked in silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's father showed a hazy smile: "How could she suspect us?" We are already softened by her, and the good parents who agreed to the marriage contract, if they want to kill him, how could they promise to agree to the marriage contract? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Shirley’s mother suddenly realized, "So I promised the marriage contract?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, otherwise how can I give in? "Shirley's father nodded. "At today's party, the young people who like Shirley seem to be very dissatisfied with the poor boy. Shirley should treat them as suspects." It has always been one of the main factors of crime. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Very good, I don't want to see the poor boy anymore! "Shirley's mother smiled with satisfaction. "Dear, you are so smart, when do you want to start, I have to look at Shirley." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley's father shook his head: "Don't worry, I said."嫉妒 has always been one of the main factors of crime. The few boys are born of nobles. They have always been bold and arrogant about the civilians. So we can observe for a while, maybe they can help us achieve the goal? Then we don't have to risk the adventurers. Oh, I promised this banquet for this purpose. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have always been right. "Shirley's mother smiled and nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main manor houses In the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three noblest children who were most provocative in the previous banquet quietly gathered together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Andrew, my anger is hard to contain. "One of the aristocratic children of natural curly hair said angrily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat young aristocrat called Andrew was gloomy and sullen: "I am the same!" Yes, I like Shirley very much, but I can't get the degree of madness before she gets it, so if she marries other nobles. I will only be sad and sad, and I will not do anything too aggressive, but, however, she is going to marry a civilian kid, a kid who has no hope of stimulating blood! This is an insult to my personality, an insult to the dignity of the nobility. How do I treat other people at the party later? 'Yo. Andrew, are you even a civilian kid? ’”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural volume of the aristocrats who spoke originally tried hard: "I am like you, but now the poor boy is Shirley's fiancé. If we want to do something, I am afraid to be excited by Baron Brenzel. They have a nearby Wide range of influence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very frustrated, Brunzer is Shirley's last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room became quiet and caught in an unspeakable silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Andrew snorted: "This kind of thing can be done without us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well?" The other two looked at him doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andu laughed and said: "I know a night watchman. As long as he accuses the poor boy of being a magic apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a magic apprentice?" asked the young aristocratic amber eye in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it was before or not, it must be in the future." Andrew said insidiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! The other two nobles were no strangers to this trick, and they understood Andrew's true meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if Baron Brenzel is going to save him?" The natural volume nobles raised a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew laughed and said: "Since the church occupied Aalto, the magicians have been hiding more hidden. Many night watchmen have not killed the evil people for a long time. It is said that the upper level of the referee is somewhat dissatisfied with this, fearing that the bottom watchman will lose value. Therefore, as long as there is a clue of the magician, this part of the night watchman will certainly not let go, as long as the Baron Bronzel rescues people before getting 'evidence', let The poor boy himself confessed, the baron dared to fight against the referee, against the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no 'evidence', then the baron can't bear him before saving people. Torture and 'death', anyway, is just a civilian, no one will really pursue it." The young aristocrats with amber eyes complement the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of natural curly hair are a little worried about the truth: "But can the night watchers get used to the 'making magician', will it get us? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot, we are nobles!" Andrew groaned. "Okay, let's make up the 'Kintal', so that I can easily convince me. The night watchman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the three were actively discussing, there was a maid standing outside the door, her right hand holding a tea tray, and her left hand solidified in the air. Keep the posture before knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pale and her ears swayed slightly, and the sound inside was heard clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a special human being, although she did not stimulate the blood and became a knight, but she was a bit special and had a good hearing. So she was sent by the Brunsell service room. work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding your breath, the maid turned quietly and left the door step by step. After waiting for the corner, she accelerated her pace and went to the master bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, you are doing very well, I will deal with this matter, you don't tell the lady, lest she worry." Baron Brenzel The face said "indignation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嘿. This plan is really great. As long as I have passed the night tonight and tomorrow, no matter what I do, I can't save Vicente's life. Shirley, don't blame me. Dad can't do anything... He rehearsed how to comfort Shirley's words in his heart. Well, when Vicente was arrested, he buried the maid in the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not leave a loophole in doing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the nightmare who had a nightmare wakes up and sends breakfast to the guests. It turns out that young nobles such as Andrew don’t know when already left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They started to act?" The maid thought a little worried. Miss Shirley is gentle and kind. She has a very good attitude towards her servants. She never fights and tortures. If her fiancé dies, she will be very upset. I don’t know if the Baron adults can come and stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss is very happy..." She thought subconsciously, would you like to tell her about it. Let her tell Mr. Victor to hide and wait until the Baron adults solve this problem before returning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her impression, Andrew’s family is much more prominent than the Baron, so there is a bit of concern that Baron Brenzel can’t stop it in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was squatting at the door, always determined, one side is a very good lady, and the other is the order of the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly. The door of the room opened, and Shirley looked at her blankly, not knowing why she appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the atmosphere solidified, Shirley softly said: "Nice. What happened? Can I help you with anything?" She thought she was Silk is coming to ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niss made a chill and made up her mind in the soft care. She quickly looked around and whispered: "Into the room." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door closed, Shirley listened to Nisi originally had to talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face suddenly became pale, and her heart was filled with tide-like worries. If it was just a simple obituary, she believed that she had to ask her father to come forward, and there should be no problem. However, there are several bodies in the basement of Vicente, and several bodies that have been broken down by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If found by the night watchman, who would believe that he is not a magician besides himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And father and mother are not very satisfied with Vicente, it is possible to save a rescue under normal circumstances. In this case, they will never be Center guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you must inform Vicente, ask him to destroy the bodies, or throw them back into the swamp! Shirley anxiously took a few steps back and forth and decided to rush to Vicente's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want to let faster servants or guards go on their own, but how can the corpse tell others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver and another corpse were left here by the bald-headed wicked George, because the "Tombkeeper" was just buried in the cemetery today, municipal The hall and the church did not find a substitute at the moment, so George asked for two days to guard. Once the signs of undead creatures were discovered, the fireworks were immediately ignited and the vigils were able to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George won't be in this horrible cemetery, so Oliver is left: this damn boy, dare to seduce my daughter, I have to let him know that I am the manipulator of his destiny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is not worried that Oliver will escape, he will not even arrange for another corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver was conservatively tortured during this time, suffering from the pain that had never been seen before, and the madness gradually disappeared from the young face and replaced with the expression of numbness. The heart is getting mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only love is the only candlelight in this tragic world..." he whispered, though George's daughter was not beautiful, not the type he liked, but She warmed her desperate heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the companion who seemed to want to fight with others at any time, Oliver decided to go out for a turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you dare to escape, I will take you back and bury it!" The other corpse threatened him with a bad voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s mood was worse, and he was not awkward during this time. After the "Tombler" cabin, he slowly walked in the cemetery, and the thick scent had no effect on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silver Moon is so beautiful, but I am so miserable..." Oliver looked up and looked at the bright silver moon, suddenly rushing into emotions, Shi Xing Daihatsu, but when he was doing a sonnet, his feet screamed out, and a scream came out in his mouth, "Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
