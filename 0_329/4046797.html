			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Coastal Corridor, the capital of the City Alliance, Keswick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the city's most prestigious "Rose Square", the ice and snow that still bloom in the cold is like a burning flame of the same group, dazzling and burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But tonight, the night seems to disappear, their beauty is unappreciated, the square, the streets around, the nearby houses, where you can see the central huge black" The curtains were crowded with people. They looked up at their heads and looked at the changes in the curtain with almost the same shocking expression. They listened to the sad and serene melody that sounded in the bottom of the Moonlight Sonata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the "nightingale" Louise opened, they only returned from this sluggish state, bursting out a burst of exclamation, there is actually a living person in the "curtain" ? Or is this a magical spell more than a magic radio? Can you not only hear the sound, but also the wonderful spells of the figure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Miss Nightingale unlock their doubts and horror, but they lead to a more exciting and exciting wave, something they have never encountered before. Their ancestors also did not encounter it. Is this the "magic civilization" repeatedly promoted in "The Voice of Mystery"? This is a manifestation of "magic civilization." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crowd, a man with a fur cap looked at the "nightingale" Louise with a horrified look, shook his head incredulously, and the Magic Council broadcasted Is it even further? Let anyone in any place see the Valkyrie in the Grand Theatre of the Kingdom of Rentat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what does this mean? Others may not know, but as an elite night watcher, it is better than anyone else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Radio has been invented since Lucien Evans, since the launch of The Voice of Mystery. The changing attitudes of the people in many prosperous cities in the northern coastal corridors, the attitudes toward the church changed, he experienced from beginning to end, initially did not care. The changeable heart may be quietly silent, and when he feels that the atmosphere is wrong, all the details have become scary and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the failure of the church in the "Rentart Battle", from the hunters who hunt for prey, to the escaping of the emperor, to hide in Tibet prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the magic radio can not only transmit sound, but also reveal images, what a terrible change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has witnessed everything just now, understand that this model wants to be promoted like the previous magic radio, I don’t know how many years there are, but the Magic Council is Do this. Do this step by step. The church did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. You must report to the agent immediately!" He held down his leather hat, lowered his head, and retreated from the crowd of people. It took a while to squeeze out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the square, the surrounding quickly became quiet. The night watchman quickly found a hidden corner and took out a brooch-like magic. Items, trying to sue the church for what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a hurry and directly contacted the headquarters of the heresy of the holy city of Lance, but there was only a noisy sound on the "brooch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! The voice of the mystery of the Magic Council can be heard everywhere, and can also transmit images, but I can’t even contact the holy city of Lance. How come this is against the magician?" He suddenly became mad and frustrated and anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he also understands that it is not the same year, Kswick has been controlled by the Magic Council, without the cathedral with the material transfer array and the sound transmission array. The method was transferred, so the night watchman who was on the opposite side of the Stormwind Strait and the North Coastal Corridor could no longer be as convenient as before. The move just was his subconscious habit, but the wizard of the Magic Council was in the area ruled by the church. Still able to rely on "artificial planet" to communicate with Allinge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gap is the real reason for his frustration and urgency! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artificial planet that seemed to be created only to challenge the authority of the true god is increasingly imagining the radiant, it is definitely the most influential in the alchemy items. One of the pieces,! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cigarette ignited, and he took a deep breath, eased his emotions, and then re-energized the brooch, liaising with the boss who was also lurking in Keswick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigilist bite his teeth and must propose to the church to develop our own artificial planet! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also understands that the product of this frontier field of arcane research is difficult for the cardinal of the church to copy - "launch satellites", they are There is no pressure, so chances are to capture the artificial planet of a magical parliament! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information about "satellite live broadcast" is due to the parliament’s control over its own ruling area, so it is passed to the holy city of Lans, one level at a time, perhaps Before the completion of "Women", Pope Benedict III had not received it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent golden color is the main color of the Grand Theatre of the Kingdom of Rentit A magical crystal lamp or hanging from the ceiling or inlaid on the wall, sprinkling pure and bright brilliance, complementing the gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha are sitting in the box, waiting for the performance of "Valkyrie". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been expecting this opera for several years, and I am finally able to fulfill my wish tonight." Oliver walked in with a polite voice, took off the white gloves, and smiled. Shake hands with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many differences in the microscopic field, he will not be glaring at Lucien, especially in his favorite drama and opera fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you like it." Lucien smiled and asked Oliver to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to him, there are not many legendary magicians who are willing to come to the opening ceremony of the Rantart Festival. Douglas is busy with his preparations and has no experience with the opera. Special love, so it didn't appear. Brooke is almost the same reason. Vicente has a cold relationship with Lucien and doesn't like opera. Even his daily life seems to be lacking. He wants to put all his time into the arcane. Helen with magic research is even more impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the legendary magicians are out, and some guard the national branches. Some are busy studying and have not appeared here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Opera is not something too interesting." Sitting in the "storm dominated" by Lucien, Fernando looked at the stage with his eyes, still wearing his own bright red Magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing "Women of Valkyrie" is about to begin, Lucien uses the soul to connect to Natasha: "Does Hathaway not come?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She may not like the occasion of so many people. I remember that she is still very interested in music and opera," Natasha guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and said nothing. The Prime Minister of the Holm Kingdom, Russell, had already begun to address and announced the opening of the festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prime Minister! I am still seeing the Prime Minister for the first time. Look like this!" Banus said with a happy and surprised voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriha pulled him and snorted: "Be careful, otherwise it will be reprimanded by the policeman. After the coronation of the Queen, it’s just a reprimand, if Before, it would be whipped for disrespect for the nobility." And it is still such a big aristocrat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand. Understand. Actually. You see them, and they are similar to me. The policeman wants to reprimand. I am afraid I will be reprimanded to the throat." Banu Sis is very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell announced the start of the intense preparations after the opening of the Rantart Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short time before the start of the opera, the magician responsible for the broadcast adjusted the angle of the image magic array, allowing the "audience" to see the full view of the Kingdom Theatre. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too gorgeous, able to listen to the highest level of opera in such a theater, it is really dead and no regrets!" Banus and others have admired . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
