			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping out of the door of the small hotel, Sharp’s body image was broken like a blisters, disappearing into the thick night, and Old Green did not regain his gaze, hoarse The voice said: "Are you ready to accept his mission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether we will eventually accept it, the most important issue at the moment is that it is no longer safe here. We must move immediately." Douglas's expression was quite serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando also woke up and muttered: "This mission will not be accepted by the old man. All we can do is leave here, and then we have to Establish a place to contact the transfer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an obvious question, even if the union promised to take over the task of assassinating Alfonso and the big nobility represented by Sharp We have established a good private partnership and will not expose the contact stations that are important to the entire organization to their sights. If communication is needed, it is better to maintain a smaller and more unidirectional channel, such as by Old Green. Come to shoulder this task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this kind of thing, the general idea will only mean that the organization is not far from extinction! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, Fernando is worried that the wall will be connected to Douglas and Old Green Road with the soul in mind: "See the underwater relics of Lake Lamourag."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you must leave first, I have to leave some secrets to warn the Master who came during this time." Old Green looked around the lobby of the small hotel, in tone There are obvious sighs and disappointments, as if they were forced to leave their homes that have worked so hard for decades and have to go far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sneered aloud: "This broken place is lost and lost. What are you sorry for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, this is the 'family industry' that my great-grandfather started to operate." Old Green's tone is faint, not a little angry, like talking about other people's things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stunned and looked down at his toes, then raised his head and looked at the wine cabinet behind the old Green with a pair of bright red eyes: "Maybe this hotel will be preserved. You are a Knight of the Day. It has a good relationship with many nobles. It may come in handy in the future, but there won't be so many magicians here..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said a big pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, tempered boy! I don't need your sympathy!" Old Green suddenly burst into a foul mouth and interrupted Fernando's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face turned slightly red and snorted: “I sympathize with the black-clawed dog and will not sympathize with you, the old man who lies halfway into the cemetery!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green lifted his chin and signaled Douglas to keep up, and snorted at the same time: "The Necromancer does not often say that lying in the graveyard is the beginning of life? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rot-like bodies of the stinking body know what is life?" Fernando said without saying back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stupid boy, I am still not a big man at age, know what is life?" Old Green "does not show weakness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Douglas’s slightly helpless look, the two have been arguing that Fernando is out of the door and into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the starlight, the lake is a little bit shimmering, sparkling, peaceful Quiet, and there are many such lakes, like scattered pearls, scattered on the earth, and connected into a string of dreamy necklaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not the 'land of thousands of lakes'..." Douglas floating on the lake said with amazement, and took a deep breath with a touch of water Fresh air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is a bit surprised: "Do you know the land of thousands of lakes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this good-looking..." Fernando whispered without an aesthetic taste, and then said, "This is Lake Lamourag, you pay attention to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Douglas looked at the lake and found that it was not big. It was said that there was a giant otter and some people believed that such a small lake could have underwater remains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cast spells, fell into the water, and quickly sinked to the bottom of the lake in the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando noticed Douglas’s strangeness and explained in the mind connection: “I don’t know which idiot magician built it, maybe he wants to put the whole thousand The land of the lake is all connected, but it is because of his idiot that this ruin has not been discovered, and the church cannot imagine that there will be relics under such a small lake with no resources."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a huge stone, there is a small cave hidden in it. It is not like a human being. It is like a nest of some aquatic creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gasified the form directly, and drilled in. Douglas did not hesitate, followed by gasification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the narrow "pipe", Douglas found himself in a palace where many magicians came and went, to them The arrival was quite alarming, but after seeing Fernando's familiar beauty, he turned his head and was busy with his own things, such as the exchange of alchemy materials and magic books, such as asking others to refine items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, a high-level magician directly casts magic to check whether Fernando is deformed or disguised for others. In this respect, it is referred to as "sewer." The "magic" of the "mouse" can be more vigilant than the referee, because they are already wary, they are already dead, or "study" at a costly price will be "vigilant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a feeling of a magician gathering here..." Douglas said slightly with a sigh of relief and sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas, Fernando, you are coming right, the president knows what happened just now, please go see him." Roland Jr., who escaped early in the cover of Fernando Run over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is the headquarters of the union?" Douglas was a bit strange, Fernando did not mention before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando also feels weird: "Where is the president?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." Roland Point Nodded, I looked at Fernando up and down. "You're fine. The president was prepared to see Douglas and hold a core meeting here. As a result, the grilled fish hotel had an accident..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be against me, not so fast let me know where the headquarters are... Douglas swears, but he has never been entangled in this small problem, generously nodded: "Roland, trouble You take us to see the president."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fool task they gave..." Fernando followed Beuglas and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing a stone paved ramp, there is a hall full of strange patterns at the end, a man who has to be white and spirited Welcomed, hehe smiled: "Welcome to join our magician union, Douglas, you are an excellent magician, your research on curves, irregular graphics has come before us, if you have the opportunity, hope to Asked for your advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas slightly stunned, and Annord, the president of the Union of Wizards, knows that he is studying "flows"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "stream number" is the name of the initial part of the mathematical content he studied for himself, but he increasingly feels that the name is not appropriate and he intends to change it. change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s surprise didn’t last long, and soon I realized that my communication with Fernando in the past few days has always been watched by Annod, even he The core meeting will take place only a few days later, perhaps also to have time to "observe" yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming the leader of a fairly large magic organization is really not easy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The study of many great magicians in the past gave me inspiration," Douglas said humblely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He introduced a few people who followed him. There were many wrinkles, and Rieger with a eagle-hook nose. He was tall and thin, a Ramen with a horse face, and his blond hair was high, and his eyes were like gems. Veronica, they are all wearing a typical magical robes, gloomy and deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas greeted one by one and smiled at a brown-haired young man next to Anord: "Gallos, long time no see."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man’s hair is neatly separated to the sides, the tall collar reaches the top of his head, with a cynical smile on his face: “I didn’t expect you to do a raid on the referee. The thing, this is the style of Fernando."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the friend of Douglas to the Union of Magicians, Carlos, Fernando and Roland, Anord Student, a six-ring high-ranking mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you envious?" Fernando didn't suffer at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallos laughed, his black eyes looked at the toes, and did not answer, because the president, Ann Arnold, began to ask: "You commissioned the 'dark blue demon' What is the opinion of the mission?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who led the way, quietly withdrew from the palace and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rig sullenly said: "He just used this task to warn us that there is no need to get caught up in this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if we can really do it? Will he really value us and cooperate with us initially?" Ramon pulled a long face and opposed Rig's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, we have to be able to complete!" Rieger and Veronica also said that the statement is different, but the meaning is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly calmed down, even Fernando did not dare to boast Alfonso is not difficult to kill, after all, the union is currently being "the heart of time" Ketonian stare With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord seems to be very satisfied with this situation, his face is unchanged, coughing two channels: "We are not without the opportunity to complete this task." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President, don't be kidding!" Rigg said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really impossible to rely solely on our own strength, but if there are other magical organizations to cooperate with? They are not concerned by the 'heart of time'." Anord’s temper seemed to laugh very well, and then continued before everyone spoke. “I have been busy with other magic organizations during this time. It’s just a certain result, and I have invited a lot of magic organizations to’ Aringe's guest, discussing the issue of cooperation, so I will set up today's meeting here, not the headquarters, because 'Aringe' is also near Rantat."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He explained why he didn't bring Douglas to the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President, are you sure to convince those organizations to cooperate?" Veronica is at the heart of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord smiled awkwardly, like an old fox: "If they knew us and the deputy head of the Knights of Truth -" The Dark Blue Devils' teamed up and willing to work with us to accomplish this task. Contacting the nobility to counter the church is not the only strategy we can come up with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When are we and Has the 'Deep Blue Devil' cooperated?” Even Ramon expressed his incomprehension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod laughed and said: "After joining other organizations to complete the assassination of Alfonso, he should pay attention to our strength." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando twitched his mouth, the president was too treacherous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which organizations are there to ‘Aringe’?” Rig thought about it and asked questions cautiously without further entanglement in the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod nodded: "Reassure, the organization I invite is weaker than us, not 'Parmela's cabin', ' The legendary organization of Death Scythe and 'Music Dance', it is worth noting that there are one to two nine-ring masters of 'red eye', 'soul supreme', 'shadow singer' and 'tower of destroyers' The rest have dozens of twenty ordinary organizations without the nine-ring wizard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
