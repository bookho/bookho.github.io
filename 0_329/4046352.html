			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is something weird?" Lucien knew it and felt that his acting skills were getting better and better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a few days later, it’s still out of Lucian’s expectation that I thought it would be too detailed for at least a month or two. accurate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock was a little excited: "I think we might find something new, Lucien, it’s a great XXX. Fast, come to the lab, You see what you know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a person who is unconstrained in thinking. At this time, he screamed straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discovery may not be a fruitful result for Lucien. Each of his papers received a second-level evaluation, or won a tribute. Or, it’s a raging discussion. In just a few years, from an arcane score, it has not become a five-level arcane master. It has excelled in the younger generation, and even many magicians who have lived for two or three hundred years are also in this respect. I dare not compare with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For yourself and other middle-level arcane masters and magic apprentices, a new discovery often means at least ten base rewards for arcane points. Not to mention that new discoveries will surely cause many people to explore. Quoting points is a considerable amount of data. Even if there are several people sharing, it will take a month to break through the bottleneck and become a second-level arcian. In less than a year or two, you can move into the middle level, laying a solid foundation for the improvement of the magic level, which makes Rock not excited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, Rock, calm." Lucien interrupted his magical analysis, tightened the magic robe, followed Roque to the laboratory next door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, my XXX is too eye-catching, following you this genius arcian research is full of surprises, your intuition is too sharp. If Without you, how can we associate the solution with gas discharge? I thought about it for a few months. When I changed the second-class arcane badge back to school, the idiot idiot of the electromagnetic system would surely scare off my chin... ..." Rocke continually showed the essence of his own words, but his thoughts were too leaping, completely forgetting to describe new discoveries, and his esteem for Lucien was beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it can "make lightning" in the air and it doesn't have much impact, the electromagnet's magicians have been subconsciously studying the phenomenon of gas discharge. Ignore the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly licked his mouth, although it is not clear whether Rock found a cathode ray (electron flow) or a plasma phenomenon (plasma), but Is it too exciting? In the future, those things must not scare him to death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rock and Lazar, the lower-level arcane masters, the cognitive world is still very incomplete, much higher than most middle-level arcans It is a very good potential supporter that the Arcanist is more likely to accept new theories without knowing the world's collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Planck, who first made the energy hypothesis on Earth, once said such a famous saying: A new scientific truth cannot be convinced by its opponents. And to win by understanding, its victory is mainly due to the fact that its opponents have finally died, and the new generation familiar with it has grown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for the Magic Council, every high-level magician is an important cornerstone that is impossible to get, and one headshot is very big. The harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformed laboratory shines with metallic luster, and numerous cold lines form complex runes, magical arrays, a black line, and pipes that are extremely artistic. The way of the breath is arranged, and the ceiling is hanged from a metal or a hand made from the body of Warcraft, allowing the magic apprentices to make dangerous moves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the application of Lucien, the alchemy platform and the magic array have added defensive curses and filth arrangements, because many magicians are unconscious in the experiment. Being cursed and debilitating and dying. At the same time, Lucien is very clear that the magical array of these protective curses that he has repeatedly selected has the composition of lead in it, otherwise if one day he is hurt by the surname of the surviving Passing away, jokes can be big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, repeat the experiment just to Lucien." Rock took Lucien to the side of the discharge magic array and told him this group. Sprint and Heidi, Lazar have been waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magic apprentices whose names are not stable are not selected by Jerome for experiments that require meticulous and patient ultra-low temperature material changes, but now follow Mr. Rock to complete the Ivan When the teacher's experimental project was unexpectedly discovered, it was very exciting and very exciting. It seemed to have seen the official arcade badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gas discharge glows, and it is strange that the green glow is also flashing on the glass opposite the cathode magic array. When Heidi stops the magic array, the green glow disappears accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you see, there is nothing on the surface of the cathode magic array. There was no similar paper before, maybe it was never found. Ray." Rock looked forward to Lucine, waiting a little nervously for his answer. He is already the authority of the Arcane in the minds of most middle and low-level Arcans, and should be able to judge through this phenomenon. What happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar, Heidi, and Sprint also hold their breath at the same time, uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly became somewhat solid, just as Lucien, Soup, Aphrodite, etc. faced the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Before the experiment was confirmed, it was only hypothetical. The only thing that can be determined is that in the past discharge experiments, no one found This, but can not rule out that the ray may be the electromagnetic wave and particle flow that we are familiar with. We need to design different experiments to verify. Each of you is involved in the research, and the experiment you designed yourself can be written into the essay reading."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side, Lucien opened the discharge magic array and waited until the opposite side of the glass showed a green glow, placing an obstacle between the two, suddenly, on the glass Corresponding shadows appear, confirming the relationship between glow and discharge magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" Rock and others responded with excitement, both as an expectation and a gratitude to Lucien for his goodwill. He even allowed the members of the Institute to read the papers in a reading manner. Unlike other research projects, whether the experiment was designed by the leader himself or not, he was the first author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the cathode ray is a ray that has never appeared before, then the relevant experimental papers of yourself and others will certainly be quoted, even if it is not comparable to the discovery of cathode ray. The paper itself is also a considerable score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the discovery of cathode ray papers, they all agree that Lucien is the first author, not only because he is the host of the Institute of Atomic Research, but also because of the entire experiment. It was his arrangement and arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw their desire to try, and smiled slightly: "I will join you, Jerome, they can also be in private time. The time has been exhausted. Right, I will announce several regulations of the Institute of Atomic Research. First, if it is the research idea that I have put forward, the magic experiment of design, the reading of the paper will be signed, I will not be cheeky; second, the rest of the project Members are not allowed to publish privately. I must sign and review them. This is clearly stated in the Parliament. Third, a weekly meeting will be held on Mondays to discuss their experimental progress and research."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a specific project, Lucien will turn the monthly meeting into a weekly meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few words, Lucien had the feeling of "mentor" and "boss", and his heart was dumbfounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the provisions of Lucian, Lazar, Rock and others are no doubt, but think that Lucien is really a good person! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Because of the sensation of the previous issue of "Arcane", even though Lu Xi'an's thesis has not been officially published, many high-end relationships The arcane masters and middle-level arcans also know the proponent of the formula, Lucien, through their own news channels. Evans? X has completed the construction of the formula arcane meaning, so I have borrowed this paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holly Kingdom "Heidler" City, the headquarters of the pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the promotion of the ranks, Felipe, who concentrated on constructing magic in the soul, put his hands in the black trench coat pocket and quietly looked at the quiet light gray outside the magic tower. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that the organization still harbors such a big secret, and even discovered the alienation space that the Parliament of the Dead Spirit does not know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of the golden level and the unlimited potential, Felipe was quickly included in the core of the pale hand, learned the existence of the dead spirit world, knowing that it is a strange world with a dead soul There is a certain projection relationship with the real world. Many of the undead are still intelligent. The name of the "dead world" is translated from their language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the connection to the dead spirit world, there is a significant gain on many necromantic magic, and it is more convenient to summon high-order undead, "Pale Hand" will The secret was concealed and the routine exploration was carried out without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
