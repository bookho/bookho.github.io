			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper crown pub close to noon is slightly brighter, and the radiant light will be punctured, compared to the early morning when Lucien came, the people inside A lot more, the barking voice, the voice of the bard, the high talk and the sounds mixed together, it seems noisy and noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien noticed that there are a lot of strangers wearing leather, or fierce, even the beautiful women, it seems to be Mercenaries and adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toughly through the crowd, Lucien finally squeezed into the front of the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, guest, come for a drink?" Yann drank the ale, and his head didn't lift up and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed and said: "Uncle Uncle, it is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lucine, how did you look like this?” Yan En saw Lu Xi’s bruised face, his beard shaking, and he looked a little surprised. “Wait, Jackson of Aaron’s gang in the morning came to inquire about you. Little guy. You won't get rid of these villains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not willing to say more: "Well, things have been solved, Uncle Uncle, I think Do you know which scholars are teaching the text?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, have you gotten five Silverars? Wouldn't it be to rob those villains?" Even more surprised, looking at Lucien's gaze is like watching an unknown creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought that it was really a robbery, but can't say that, so I explained a few words and mentioned that the Joel family lends itself to it. The money is ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇 喝 大 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝 喝<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, you and the Joel family should be careful, although as long as John is the servant of Sir Wien, they will not dare to retaliate directly, but privately, There are always guys who like to risk gambling." Yan En warned Lucien again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly nodded: "We will be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩这Take out a piece of white paper, and it looks like a child smeared like a strange pattern: "Oh, I can't read, but I can always draw some marks myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then he read the names, residences, and time of the scholars who were willing to teach the words, and let Lucien choose himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened carefully, one by one, and suddenly heard a familiar name: "Victor? Musician Victor?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇n looked strangely at Lucien: "Yeah, do you know Mr. Victor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have met the Musicians Association, but Mr. Victor did not have a concert in the Hall of the Holy Grail after more than three months? Does he have time to teach the text?” Lucien felt that he would be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;寇恩哈哈 laughed: "Because of this, Mr. Victor will teach the text."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It is not so easy to hold a concert in the Hall of the Holy Ghost. You need to get the Board of Directors of the Musicians Association, or the invitation of His Majesty the Grand Duke, Princess Natasha. And since the Holy Hall has only one concert a week, unless It was the famous dozens of musicians, and the others had to wait for a long time. Mr. Victor was invited half a year ago. In order to prepare for this concert, he shoved all the performances, including the invitation of the Syracuse court, and the income became Rarely, it is said that it is supported by savings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands the reason: "Since Mr. Victor pays so much attention to the concert in the Hall of the Holy Sepulchre, why? Also waste time teaching text?" You can borrow money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I heard that the closer to the concert, the greater the pressure of Victor, you know that musicians are always very sensitive, if you don't find Do something else, maybe Mr. Victor will be mad at this concert! Hey." Yann drank a ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jisu District, named after the great musician who invented the violin, Jisu, is home to most musicians and musicians in Aalto, and has beautiful scenery. Quiet and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees on both sides of the street resemble phoenix trees are tall and dense, and the sunlight shines through the leaves to the ground, forming a block of bright golden spots that form light with the surrounding shadows. With a dark melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked under the tree at the address given by Yan En. After several lost, he finally found No. 12, Sneew Street, Jisu District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the blue-black wall is a two-story building with cyan vines, an ancient and quiet atmosphere, if all goes well, In the next two months, from Monday to Friday, from 2 to 4 pm every week, Lucien will be here to change his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently tapped the door, and soon there was a servant coming over, looking through the fence-like iron gate, and looked at Lucien’s dress, slightly Frowning: "Which one are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien said clearly, he still didn't believe it: "Learning text is five months. Yinnar, first, after school, are you ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not very concerned about this level of discrimination, now Nothing is more important than learning the text, so I took out the purse and poured out a few Yinnar in my hand: "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The middle-aged servant was surprised to see Lunain’s palm, and he couldn’t believe his eyes. The guy dressed so badly could come up with five Yinnars, like his musicians. The servant, only ten Yinnar in a month, it is not bad to get rid of a Yinnar every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door while watching Lu Xien: "Mr. Victor is a famous musician of Aalto, and is familiar with the officials of the City Hall. "It seems that Lu Xi'an is getting wealth from an abnormal channel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled, didn't answer, followed the well-dressed servant, crossed the courtyard, and went to the second floor and looked at him. Lightly open the brown wooden door with your hands and feet and go in for notification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, the servant came out and whispered softly: "Follow me, come and wait directly to hand Yinlun to the hall." "Housekeeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is very wide, with a low-key dark yellow carpet, close to amber coffee table, brown sofa, small round table and other furniture, in the distance It is a long table, it seems to be a dinner table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is because there are more people to study, Victor text does not choose the study, but in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa, on the red wooden chair, sitting five men and three women, it looks young and young, from the age of 13 to 20 Wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee table in front of them or the small round table with feather pens, paper and other items, from time to time carefully copy what, and more often whisper Read the pronunciation, recite the words or squat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From their wearing, Lucien can clearly see that two men and one woman, although the clothes are cleaned very clean, seems to be doing their best. Dress up, but it is still very common in nature, and the other three men and two women, whether the clothes are old or not, seem to be valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien guessed that they were ordinary members of the aristocratic family who could not inherit the title and most of the property, nor could they motivate the blood. They had no extra money. Specialized tutors can only learn from scholars, and in Aalto, becoming an elegant musician is a very good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of private teaching, it’s impossible for everyone to have the same progress, so Victor in a red jacket talks in front of him and then goes to the ear. Whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around the hall and saw a black and neat dress in the place near the door. The groomer was white and his face was white and his face was wrinkled. I am not too young, I can stand there, but my back is straight and meticulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
