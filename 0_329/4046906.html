			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City of the Sky" Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-ranking magician madly "launched" the disintegration around him, letting a common arcian, a middle-level magician face ashamed Desperate emotions spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the pale fog fell, the high-ranking magician was "locked", and the "dissociation" was included to "dissolve", and then, a deep The faint rays came out of the fog and hit the high-ranking magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly, his magical effect is lost, and no longer can use any spell, even if it is extremely arrogant and despise others, he also Slightly stunned, after all, magic is his instinct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being hit by the "anti-magic ray", most magicians will react similarly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, one by one magic came from all directions, with the tacit understanding of this high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s order to the disciplinary mage is to control and seal the main guarantees while ensuring their own safety, but if they have rich combat experience, If you are in danger, you can kill it directly. You don't have to be afraid of it, and worry about being investigated and punished afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the mad mage in front was banned, the middle and low-level magicians who were desperately sorrowful and sorrowful suddenly woke up from the nightmare and saw the white fog coming out The Taoist figure is like a disciplinary officer with a black scepter badge on his chest. The young man with a black and brown scorpion is led by the gentleman who is still afraid of it. Don't worry, there are very few 'infected people', we have basically cleared them, but you should not run around the street, so as not to be accidentally injured by my subordinates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this calm and generous voice, the nearby middle and low-level magicians relaxed a little. Looking at the distance, I saw that the burning magic tower had been extinguished, and only the black smoke appeared. The screams are gradually subsiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man left, a low-ranking magician sought to confirm: "Mr. Yurisian?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s him, it seems that the 'infected' are indeed controlled!" The mid-level magician next to him really vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian is a different kind of magician. The arcane master who received the highest honor such as the Silvermoon Medal actually chose to join the committee instead of the arcane review. The committee, and also fighting in the front line of the corrections department, but also because of this, he is considered one of the largest voices and real powers in the Panel, and will not get false information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low-level magician who asked the question was obviously relieved: "This is also normal, except for the Lavendi and others who guard the major branches. You have returned, these 'infected' can't make a big harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't believe that the legendary magician will be infected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-level magician who answered him agreed to nod, but immediately thought of what a bitter smile pointed at the sky: "We are only a little trouble here. The real danger is there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Speaker of the House can't stop Viken, we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the atmosphere that just got a little bit of color has become quiet again and again, all the magicians present have raised their heads and looked at the battle in the air, where the results determine the fate of the whole world, and I can't do anything about myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is very cruel, and a few people decide the future of most people, but it is an indisputable fact, and because the strength belongs to itself, especially obvious. This is not the field of arcane. It is not the genius of a magician. The inspiration can “beat” a legendary magician. Even if the genius is like Evans, it took more than ten years to get close to the sky. The gap between those few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the chaos subsides, more and more magicians in the "City of the Sky" begin to pay attention to the battle in "high altitude", Heidi is like this, Annick is like this, Samantha is like this, Felipe is like this, "absolute defense" is also the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not skeptical of Brooke's strength. Even if he is fighting with the body of Melmos, Brooke will not fall to the bottom, but now Melmos is only relying on the body projection, briefly playing the strength of the legendary peak, Brooke There is also Alin's help, and it will not be too difficult to defeat him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that the battle must be resolved as soon as possible, or the battlefield must be opened up to half the plane, so as not to cause a huge loss to Allinge - although there is a lock Protection, but this is an outbreak from the inside out, and the lock may not be fully borne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third general school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali and others trembled in the classroom, watching a huge "devil" wielding a sword, chasing the first time to organize Part of the school teachers and guards who defended - they have magicians or magic apprentices, some are retired soldiers, some are knights who teach the rules of battle and knights, although the level is not too high, but it is enough to withstand a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the distorted face of the "Devil", the red eyes, Ali had a burst of fear from the heart, what happened? Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear, he is very admired and envious of the teachers who can use magic or use blood to protect themselves. This is to strip away all external " Essential ability, just like the knowledge that you have learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of fears screamed in the "teaching building", so that the nervousness of Ali and others could not be alleviated, the whole atmosphere was like a full The warehouse of alchemy explosives only waited for a sparking star to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge crash came, and Ali and others suddenly saw that the devil who was getting stronger and stronger and suppressed the teachers fell directly to the ground, twitching It is divided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Knights of Rescue are coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice exclaimed, Ali saw a long-distance rider coming in with a team of knights in full armor, and the blond man standing at the front of the large aircraft, Holding a thick long gun in his hand, the muzzle has obvious electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear students, I am the captain of the Knights of Truth, John Wellesley, don't be afraid, the situation has been brought under control, then We will take over the safety protection of the nearby areas and gradually eliminate the remaining infected people. Please don't panic, don't run around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When saying this, John’s voice is a little trembling. This is also a no-brainer. In order to stabilize the situation and the hearts of the people at the fastest time and avoid the accumulation of negative emotions, he has just used high-order electromagnetic guns for a while, and he can’t control his body for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if his voice is slightly trembling, he hears Ali and others in the ear like "Holy", many people cry and cry, fear, fear, hate The emotions are discharged with tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali swayed down the wall, it was really dangerous, and now there is a body lying in his classroom! If today's course is magic-related, the teacher will kill the infected classmate in the first time, and change the music lesson and the aristocratic etiquette class. That is really unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic etiquette, aristocrat... He suddenly thought of Jane, a little nervous, what happened to Mills School? Is there anything wrong with Jane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I think about it, the more he is worried. Although he knows that Mills’ school defense is better than his own school, he still doesn’t know how many times he can’t control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running out is dangerous, the street is very dangerous...Between the inner struggles and hesitation, Ali stands up and rushes to Mills School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a figure jumped from the low air to the front of him, and Jian Jian stopped him: "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is treated as an "infected person". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
