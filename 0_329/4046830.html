			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic Research Institute. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Annick and others are waiting for the new issue of "Arcane" and "Magic", at the beginning of the beginning of the month about quantum field theory The series of papers gave them the enlightenment inspired by the arcans in the microscopic field, and felt the direction of breakthrough in the microscopic field. So under the guidance of their own efforts and the guidance of Lucien, they quickly grasped the current quantum. The field theory knowledge has completed a related paper and discussed with the Arcanists and high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, Annick and Sprint are themselves one of the founders of quantum field theory - applying secondary quantization techniques to electronic systems It was their joint thesis, so it was not too difficult to understand and grasp. Soon they quickly followed the pace of the great Arcanists such as Lucien, Brooke and Fernando, and began to get dizzy by the "infinity". They are all gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the case of low-order approximation, quantum field theory is very good, but unfortunately, when high-order approximation..." Katrina sighed, no The word "infinity" is spoken, otherwise Annick is still nothing, and Sprint will definitely be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi rarely confuses his troubles, and smiles at this time: "No matter what, this is a field that can understand the nature of electromagnetic force and electronic secrets." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused for a moment: "Oh, no, at least the quantum superposition state, the observer effect, etc. are temporarily unable to see the hope of interpretation from the quantum field theory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Moreover, the different processes in which charged particles exchange photons generate electromagnetic forces give us some inspiration. It seems that we have grasped the occasion where positrons may appear, and we have to design some Collision experiment." Cherie added to Heidi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, the discovery of particles is not as simple as finding the right ray and observing the trajectory. You must let the "ray" collide with different particles and collide at different positions. , colliding with different energies, resulting in different reactions (split or other), and then finding the anomalous trajectory from the results of these complex disturbances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of theoretical guidance, relying on experimental exploration, will be like a headless fly, can only rely on a long time to accumulate, so the legendary magician, Archmage We are temporarily unable to find anything of great value from the cosmic rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi proudly laughed: "So this will be our going to the 'Universal Observatory, the main content of the experiment, with the teacher's attention to the positron, you fight But ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint snorted: "In any case, my attention is on quantum field theory. There is still a lot of knowledge to learn and master. I didn't go to the 'University Observatory' for a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I think that the paper by Lord Hathaway is also very instructive and ' Aesthetics, when protons and neutrons are considered to be the same elementary particles, I truly feel the simple beauty of the essence of matter." Roryia's daily research is to determine the properties of different materials at different temperatures and through these The nature of synthesizing new materials, and then repeating the experiment to find out why they are superconducting is boring and complicated, so it is appreciated that the essence of all complex things will be attributed to simple views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick calmly said: "It is not so simple to think that the study of atomic decay in recent years seems to indicate that protons and neutrons are not as we imagined. Simple, or the situation in the nucleus is not as simple as we think. When it decays, it can release electrons and storms to dominate the neutrinos that you guessed. Even Lord Oliver guessed that neutrons can be converted into protons. What secrets are contained, is it difficult to say what is said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meant, Lei Yi Liya probably understood, gently nodded: "I know However, according to some arcians, 'neutrinos are almost impossible to find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neutrinos are not charged, the quality is very very light and almost no It works with matter, so it is called "invisible particle" by the Arcaneists, which means it is extremely difficult to observe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as it exists, it can be observed through design experiments!" Sprint was very confident about this, then he shook his head: "But currently the most What's important is that without a stable reactor, many experiments are difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi snorted: "Most of the Arcanists said they didn't know what they were ignoring. They couldn't keep up with the progress in the microscopic field.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the voice just fell, she stood up and smiled and said: "Good morning, teacher. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time she found Lucien walking to the door.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien Take a stack of periodicals from the storage bag and smile. "I just happened to meet the apprentice who sent you the journal. I just took it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and others are not sincere and fearful about the teacher's actions. After all, they know the teacher's personality very well, knowing that his actions are really just by the way, no Other meanings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you teacher. "Katrina, Heidi and others took the journal with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shakes the rest of the book: "The most Interesting is the new thesis of Hathaway's mother-in-law. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the most interesting?" "Sprint and others have stunned. It can be evaluated by the teacher as interesting. What is so easy? This shows that he appreciates the idea and direction of the paper, and also explains the inspiring value of the paper!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi quickly rushed to the catalog and found the title of Hathaway's new paper: "A Little Speculation on Strong Interaction"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading, Annick and others looked at each other and faintly guessed what, after all, the essence of electromagnetic force just had a direction, and the result immediately appeared strong mutual The force of the paper, there is no connection between the two, they are hard to believe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Hathaway will establish the "model" of quantum field theory And the idea introduces nuclear force (strong interaction force). Since the essence of electromagnetic force is the complex process of charged particles exchanging photons, whether strong interaction force can also be considered as exchange of certain particles between nucleons (protons, neutrons) The resulting interactions?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's ideas are not difficult to understand, but need to be bound by the rules and regulations, have the courage to make associations, so, Annick, Carter Rina, Heidi and others accepted the premise of this speculation without any difficulty, and continued to read it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the research on strong interaction is still very shallow But enough to support Hathaway to build a rough model, then root According to experimental data, this kind of particle is a new particle that has not been discovered yet. The resting mass is about two or three times that of electrons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery of such particles, the nature of the strong interaction force is also presented to us..." Annick whispered a little shocked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Predict a new particle? "Katrina has a strange feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lei Yi Liya slightly frowns: "If it is found, then whether weak interaction can use this Model construction, also have new particles? How many kinds of particles are there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if in a flash, the type of elementary particles has doubled, although this is only a guess, but Lei Yi Liya and others have to pay attention to it, Is it true that in the microscopic field, the types of elementary particles do not have simple characteristics? Instead, they are a complex and huge system?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint is excited: "If It’s really good to find out, that means the essence of strong interaction will have no secret in front of us, only the exploration of details! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the three basic forces beyond gravity can be attributed to the exchange of particles and construct the corresponding model, that means in our eyes, the whole world." There is no secret! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been confident and full of passion, and this time is no exception. As for the number of elementary particles, it is a matter of no need to care, anyway, it is only speculation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the study of weak interactions can't even build such a model, or else I have to predict new particles." Heidi said quite "sorry," and then she was happy. "Maybe these new particles are hidden in cosmic rays!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
