			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not expect that Sterk is really in constant trouble in the last two months, and his plan to go to the Kingdom of Holm is once again hindered, but from At the beginning of this world, all kinds of difficulties have been encountered on the road of my own life. It is difficult to walk to the present day by the spirit of never retreating and never giving up. There is only one strait from the Magic Council. Compared with the dangers I have encountered before, this obstacle is really nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien asked calmly: "Is he really a traitor? What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things must be asked clearly, you don't want to be made by Sterk's liaisons, and you don't want to be abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ferryman" tone is smothered: "His name is Harrison Brown, the official knight, two weeks ago in the "Sturker" He published the report of his acceptance of the medal, on the grounds: 'Defending the glory of the Lord in the darkness, purifying nearly fifty lost lambs.' If you suspect what I said, you can go to the city library to find the issue. In the newspaper, there was even a speech in the city council when he was honored, and there was no regret for the more than 30 magic apprentices who died because of him. Most of these apprentices were only twelve or three years old and only accepted. The basic training of arcane theory has not yet entered the state of meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will verify it." Lucien nodded. "But I still have A question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ferryman" looked at Lucien's slightly dull face: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my travels and previous experience, for this betrayal, the church is immune from this to ensure their safety. Retaliation, has always been a secret reward, or allow them to be added directly to the night watchman squad. Basic not heard openly awarded Knight of the Order of. Perhaps this is a trap? "Lucien will not take his own life a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ferry" is not surprising to Lucien who can see this, like the magician who grew up in church suppression and pursuit The theory of surgery will be very lacking, but it is definitely better than the ones educated in the security environment of the parliament in terms of sensitivity and strain: "Yes, we also think this may be a trap for the night watchman. But we must kill him, To shock those guys who are ready to move inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We would have tried to assassinate without you. Now I will give you this thing, so that you can pass it as soon as possible." Test to Aringe. If you refuse, it doesn't matter, leave a contact information to me, I will tell you when there are other things that can prove identity in the future." He paused. "If you accept, it is necessary. We can ask for it, we will help you to draw the attention of the night watchman. But we will not tell you in what way, after all, you have not proved your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you succeed We will be the greatest enthusiasm to welcome the new companion "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; his heart silently make a sentence, if you fail, we can not be implicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the blood force of Harrison Brown? Is there any extraordinary weapon or item? What is the law of activity? I think you should have collected this information. Lu Xi'an smiled and asked questions. As a formal magician, even if he was face-to-face, he had a great grasp of killing the knights of the same level, not to mention the secret attack. The main problem lies in other aspects. "Through this information, I Can you be sure that you are sure to kill Harrison Brown in the protection of the night watchman and get rid of the tracking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ferry" is very satisfied with such a clever magician Dialogue, straightforwardly said: "Brown's blood power is 'regeneration', a good blood from the trolls, power, speed, as long as you don't cut your head, it will regenerate indefinitely before consuming the body's energy. Of course, since it is the blood of the troll, acid and fire can destroy his regeneration and make him truly dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a hand in him. Level 1 given by the parliament When the weapon dies with a spear and adds toxin damage, the church rewards him with a second-class supernatural item, the Hunting Man Shield, which absorbs a certain degree of elemental damage in addition to its own defense of the second-level knight. As for the existence of other extraordinary items, we don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The law of his activities is..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "ferry" told the information about Brown one by one, and Lucien, Lucien listened quietly and analyzed possible opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the wax artist of Soge promised Brown to make a vivid wax figure for him before he went to Lance and put it in the wax museum to recognize his contribution to the darkness. So he will definitely go Participate in this opening ceremony. Of course, it is not excluded that the night watchman will let him often come out for activities." After the ferryman answered, he repeated it again. "At that time, if we need to lead the night watchman, please let me know in advance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let me try." Lucien accepted the incident with a dull expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After agreeing with the ferryman about the location and the sign, Lucien walked into the darkness in a small boat and used the dual means of magic and knight to get rid of the tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the middle of the night, Lucien, wearing a black hooded robe, appeared on the edge of a stone arch bridge, which is the gateway to the Sog Wax The museum is one of the two bridges on the island, and it is the best choice from the villa where Brown lives to the island. Taking another bridge will take a big circle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, according to Lucien, as the wax artist of Soge is very popular in Stourke, there will be many nobles and big businessmen tomorrow. When they come to the ceremony, their private boat will definitely be filled with water that can be docked near the wax museum, so even if you take a canoe through the canal, you will disembark on the water and then go to the wax museum through the stone arch bridge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the middle of the night, the sky is a little bit starry, the water surface reflects the waves, and it is quiet everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood by the bridge, his hands pressed against the bridge, his mouth screaming silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ripples of the road were uploaded from the road to the stone arch bridge, and they were fed back, then adjusted and then feedback. Gradually, the stone bridge began to show The ground swayed and became more and more intense, and the swing was getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor's Resonance Hand"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the amplitude of the stone bridge is reaching its limit, it will collapse at any time, but Lucien suddenly stops and watches it calm down, with no change before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the internal structure of this stone bridge has been devastated, although it has not collapsed, but it is enough to produce a certain degree of load. Lucian hopes for a small change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The black-streaked heraldic boat stopped by the street, Harrison? Brown walked down with the entourage. He looked at the extraordinary boat that docked oppositely. He couldn't help but look forward to his longing. When can he have the same status as them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly watching for a few minutes, Brown was surrounded by the entourage, going to the stone arch bridge 100 meters away, where people came and went without any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Brown looked around, although he knew that there were several powerful night watchers who were nearby to protect and monitor themselves, but knew more about their betrayal. Enchanted the Magic Council to anger, can not be inadvertently cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the church’s request, I can’t ignore it, I have to go out and move around occasionally. I hope that these months will be safe, and when I get to Lance, I can Be completely relieved to enjoy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this cautiousness, Brown and his entourage embarked on a stone arch bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, on a boat that was not far from the bridge, Lucien, in a black suit, nodded to a carriage on the shore: Remember to send the steel to Utaka. This is your reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man driving the carriage showed a thick smile: "Please, please rest assured. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly moved, and Lucien also signaled the boatman to paddle the boat, as if preparing to cross the stone arch bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy steel carriage drove up the stone arch bridge not far away, and Brown just walked to the center of the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison? Brown's pace is slow, and he keeps watching, but the pedestrians who come and go are so ordinary. Occasionally, the strength does not seem weak, and it is also the followers of the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
