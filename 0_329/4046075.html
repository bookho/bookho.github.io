			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worship is the nephew of the majority of believers in the church of truth. The five-story building of the Musicians Association is similar to Gothic architecture. It is very deserted. It is ugly to see people coming in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Lucien walked up the steps, the two guards saluted with a warm smile: "Good morning, Mr. Evans." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning." Lucien was a bit strange. He ended the concert at 10 o'clock last night. Today is another week, and the association cannot spread itself so quickly. The thing, but the attitude of the two guards explains everything, "Is Elena telling them?" Elena is the only person in the concert who needs to come to the association to work, but Lucien doesn't think Elena is like the kind of person who is being promoted everywhere, unless someone asks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was passed by himself, the two guards quietly huddled together and whispered: "I don't think Mr. Evans can be so fast. Become a musician. I remember that he came here to carry garbage more than three months ago. I also helped him see the cart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't think of it Ah." The other guard looked back at Lu Xien’s back. "In the last two months, Mr. Evans went to the library every day. He often practiced musical instruments in the afternoon. It is similar to other music students. Who can think of him? Musical genius!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first guardian shook his head: "Unfortunately, I don't have a musical talent, otherwise I don't have to guard the door here, huh, Ivan. Mr. Si must have resigned from the library. Is his talented musician afraid of no aristocratic sponsorship? I am afraid there is no chance to open a concert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Association Hall, Elena and Casey are working After looking at the things in the wooden cabinet, after seeing Lucien, he quickly stood up and said: "Good morning, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Irene With a playful smile, Na is like a good joke, and Casey is completely respected and restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Elena, good morning, Kathy, what are you doing?" Lucien asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena blinked and said with excitement: "Lu Xien, is the latest issue of "Music Review" and "Symphon Guide". The first time I saw the name of my friend in these two newspapers, you are awesome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is illiterate but has long been in music The work of the association has touched a lot of written materials, plus people who are also thoughtful and diligent, and after some guidance from Lucien, they have been able to recognize all the letters and recognize the names of most people in the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was slightly surprised and said: "So fast, shouldn't the two newspapers be released at the end of the month? And the concert was held yesterday."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Music Review and Symphony Herald are the most authoritative newspapers in the music industry, and are sought after throughout the continent, published in the last few days of each month, mainly in the past. The excellent music and comments of the entire continent in a month, as well as the things of some famous musicians, of course, are basically Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor’s concert is in the third week of the harvest month, and for the most part, there is still one week before the two newspapers come out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena looks excited: "I heard that many musicians were infected by your symphony of destiny, so they wrote comments overnight and went to church in the morning." Before handing over to the association, the association decided to publish it in advance, which was the first batch printed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, do you want to buy one?" Kathy looked at Lucien with curiosity, restraint and respect. In her opinion, today's two copies must have a collectible meaning for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien felt that if he didn’t buy it, some couldn’t make it, so he smiled and said: “One kind of give me a copy.” Then I took out the purse and poured it out. Twenty copper fairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the work came to the association, Lucien was given to Alisa three silverinars and purchased clothes every month, most of the money After squatting down, all the materials and utensils needed were temporarily satisfied through the party without paying money, and the money bag no longer dried up as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What did you write above?” Elena handed two newspapers to Lucien, curiously asking, the same was true of Casey. When they were at the Musicians’ Association, the biggest hobby was to find familiar people. Read newspapers and books, such as Piero, such as Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the "Music Review" and looked at it, on the first page, in addition to the "music commentary" three thick black words and "sacred In the ninth issue of 815, there is only one painting of the appearance of the Hall of the Holy Grail, and two lines of black characters: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gentlemen, ladies, take off the hat, pay tribute Well, this is a true genius!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Othello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena and Casey heard the two lines of words that Lucien read out, and they looked brighter and looked at the road with admiration. Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the first page, the first article that Lucien saw was "Music also needs the soul - a tribute to the symphony of destiny":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Music is the gift that the Lord has given us, the weapon that inspires us to move forward, but in the past three hundred years, except for the sacred and solemn religious music, other music is just It simply makes us feel good. And such goodness always makes people feel pale and weak, and it is difficult to impress people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Until the concert of Mr. Victor in the Hall of the Holy Ghost, after hearing the symphony of destiny created by his student Lucien Evans, I realized what the music really needs!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Music is a poem for everyone's inner feelings. If there is no integration of emotions and no burst of spiritual power, then the music is destined to be pale and unable to infect others, as if lost. The living soul of the soul, and this symphony of destiny, has a theme and feelings that run through four movements. That is the uncompromising of the darkness, the struggle with the hardships, so it is the most passionate, shocking, powerful and most touching symphony I have ever heard."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Sien? Evans is an undisputed musical genius that is shocking the entire Aalto music industry and is destined A genius that will shake the mainland music industry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Music needs feelings, Like life needs a soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is very long, but mostly lyrical, with very little professional music analysis, the reason why it can rank in "Music Review" The first one, because its author is the Grand Duke of Vaoli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena listened to Lucien briefly after describing it, a little exclaimed: "So high evaluation? Dagong’s sire seems to like your symphony of destiny. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four consecutive 'most' words, Dagong has never had this kind of evaluation." Casey also sighed with an attachment, "Mr. Evans, What about the second?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second commentary article is written by Natasha, "The emotional music theme will surely become the trend of the future - from The Symphony of Destiny Sees the Revolution of Music":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The theme melody and feelings throughout the music support a great symphony." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Evans, a talented musician, composed a short unit of melody with four short and powerful accents, and constructed it. A single, continuous and throughout the theme of the whole piece of music, a theme that overcomes the darkness of light, never shrinks and gives up in the face of difficulties, but a single The theme of the performance of the different instruments, and the emergence of a variety of surnames, several similar themes of the fierce confrontation, the thorough feelings of Mr. Lucien Evans's inner feelings."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the spirit of a hero. This is the firmness that never gives up. This is the code of every knight. It is also the knight spirit that I respect and believe most, besides the Lord, so I Deeply infected by this great symphony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is short and powerful The four notes are like the heart of everyone, driving the whole music. I want to name the similar minimum unit chords as music motives. With them, there will be a complete structure of the theme symphony."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
