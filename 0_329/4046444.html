			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nature?” Nesika coughed: “Evans’s explanation is very appropriate, but as a journal in the field of mathematical science, the name is not space. Pan? Can't you understand at a glance what journal it represents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! This is a question for everyone including Levski. The journals such as "Arcane", "Magic", "Star" and "Element" can judge the direction of the paper according to the title. "Nature" will make people think it is wrong. The journals created by the Druids, even though they like Lucien’s praise for mathematics, like the phrase “the most beautiful and essential language in nature, the uniform rules in all fields”, but mathematics serves arcane. The status quo of serving magic tells them that not everyone agrees with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can of course not be said to be a sinister episode of his own - science must define its own meaning, create words, "natural" can directly quote: " Although Nature is currently a journal in the field of pure mathematics, I have good hopes for it. I hope that in the future, in addition to pure mathematics, it can be published for the time being unintelligible or almost impossible for everyone to understand. The theory of arcane is slowly developed into a journal that is based on pure mathematics and describes the real world. It can be compared with the journals of "Arcane" and "Magic"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This, it is too whimsical, "Arcane" "Magic" has a history of hundreds of years of development, a slightly biased theory, a tilt to the application, are the "Sacred Code" of the Arcane Masters ", has an irreplaceable status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief horror, everyone took Lu Xi’s words as his best wishes, not in his heart. Mirina smiled and said: "Use mathematical language to describe the world's reality? Well, the journal name "Nature" seems to be quite good, at least better than "world", "real", and 'mathematics' lack of expansion of the surname..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a good thing to publish an arcane theory that is temporarily unintelligible or almost impossible for everyone to understand? It may be a good thing! Maybe there will be a lot in the future The theory violates our realistic intuition and is difficult to accept in a short time. Our journals can help 'they'.” Levsky thought of himself and agreed with Lucien's proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrestricted middle-aged man Sarguero frowned: "How can you distinguish between a theory that is valuable but buried, or a ridiculous deliberate Wrong papers? If "Nature" is completely open, a journal with an impact factor of 2.0 will make most of the arcane practitioners jealous. This is not to encourage them to break away from reality, to break away from research, to make things, and to see others. Do you understand the purpose? Then quote each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky has no conscious of the journal editor, and I don’t know how to answer it, but Lucien is early. Prepared to smile: "Nature" is a 'pure' journal in the field of mathematics. Of course, it should be based on pure mathematical logic. As long as the premise of this paper is not wrong, there is no problem in logic interpretation, even if it is temporarily impossible. The committee's review can also be published as a discussion of the surname, and if the premise assumptions and logical deductions are wrong, then there is no doubt that it is an unqualified paper that can be directly rejected."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Yes, that's it!" Levsky remembered the speech that Lucien had just said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesica, Mirina, Mapel, Sarguero and other members nodded silently and could not help but emerge from the previous attack on Levski. error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Nesika looked up and looked at the sun that was sinking outside: "This is the longest one I have ever attended and the biggest lesson." The seminar. Committee of Evans, please submit your three papers as soon as possible, and we are waiting for the results to be completed before the application for the journal Nature can be completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if all the members of the mathematics field in Aringe are gathered in the conference room, the process must be taken and submitted by the Magician Management Department, which is distributed by Alchemy Life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will submit it before the Magician Management Department closes today." Lucien found that under the ambition, time has come to five o'clock in the afternoon, almost I spent the whole day in Levsky’s explanation and my own roar, and I didn’t even have lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Nesika, Salgueiro and other members leave, Levsky turned to Lucien: "Evans, thank you, very Thanks, if you are not a genius mathematician, I think I have to continue to live a life of grievances and grievances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, even if the emotions have already precipitated and expressed gratitude again, Levsky is quite emotional and excited. Evans saved himself and saved his own children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you deserve, no need to thank anyone, so you should also do the "Nature" journal to make it a genius that cannot be understood for the time being. We help." Lucian sounds gentle and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky’s mood has risen and fallen several times today, and when he is quiet now, he is quite exhausted and laughs with a strong spirit: “No matter what, I really Thank you very much, but unfortunately I am not good at the magic of the elemental field. I can't work with the Evans committee at the Atomic Research Institute. I can't learn more from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, I learned from you. Persevere, call me Evans or Lucien, it doesn't have to be formal." Lucien is meaningful and vague, "Everyone has their own If you are good at it, you don't have to force others. Levsky, you know that your new geometry and my new geometry are just a framework. There is still no specific research and lack of analytical skills. I hope we can go together. This direction continues to explore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you can no longer forget the arcane and magic, to learn more results, to solve more Mathematical problems, you have to The level of arcane and magic power is increased, so that you can live longer, and your head will not degenerate after you are old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is me I want to study the direction!" Levsky answered with excitement and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his eyebrows revealing deep exhaustion, Lucien signaled him to go back and take a rest, and Ann’s heart fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands in the pocket of the double-breasted long dress, quietly watching Levsky leave, Lucien is about to turn around and organize the papers, send When I submitted it to the Magician Management Department, I suddenly heard a word in my ear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your speech today is not bad, I can realize that the world is closer to the world, we The more the body and soul are confined to us, the more we must rely on magic and mathematical tools. Abandoning the correspondence with reality, focusing only on the initial axiom hypothesis and the inner logical deduction, may be a direction in which mathematics continues to develop." Fernan looked at the front with no expression, and praised Lucien once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the degree of praise was quite low, Lucien was flattered, carefully looking at Fernando, worried that he was a small crystal illusion, and he was blinded by him. Come back and confirm the truth: "It’s just a matter of Levski’s new geometry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Fernando smiles. Looking at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly answered quickly: "Of course. Right, what are you studying recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando glanced at him with a sigh of relief: "I re-doed the experiment of cursing the substance and found that it would radiate electrons and a new element, and there seems to be other strangeness in this substance. The traces of the elements are only a few traces and are unknown. They cannot be extracted for a while, and it takes a certain amount of time and effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is enough for the vast majority Some of the Arcans are crazy, what are the elements and atoms? What is the inner structure of it? Why is it radiating new elements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have been conjecture of the atomic internal structure model for a while, but unfortunately, without proper magic assistance, it is difficult to penetrate the microscopic world. This is the natural condition of our body and soul that limits us."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien finally understands why this is simple The speech can impress the teacher Fernando, let him make a rare praise, he has been thinking about the internal structure of the atom, so he considered the language. "In this respect, we should make bold assumptions and then use the experiment to exclude. In the direct observation of the atom Internally, we can only rely on indirect methods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These do you think I don't know?" Fernando snarled Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
