			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim underground palace, the pillars of light mixed with flames are constantly being blown down. The deep darkness melts like the first snow meets the sun, and all kinds of strange worms are stiff. The petrified, sinister shadows made a fierce cry. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer of light flashed, a priest floating in the air suddenly fell, like being dragged by the ankle, the defense The layer did not have any effect, and most of the sorcerers came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have a reaction in the future, they see the imposing blonde middle-aged man in front of his right hand, the five fingers apart, each finger highlights a small The eyes, while the palm of the hand grows a bloody yellow brown sè giant eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five weird and horrible little eyes have different colors, and they have different shè lines, but the yellow-brown sè giant eyes have a burst of light, let Everyone feels a heavy body, and it seems that the gravity here has become a lot bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green, light blue and other different shè lines hit the black robes, let them either slow, or paralyzed, or petrified, or directly into countless The light spot will instantly suppress the strong enemy that the pastor, the bishop, the paladin, and the ordinary night watchman can't solve, and see that the victory is about to be won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cultists shouted in panic, they have never encountered such a powerful enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big, high priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't the high priest stop him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, they thought of the leader of their own side, the supreme "post-chaos" voters, wasn’t he fighting with the majestic middle-aged man? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man in a white robes all heard the call and stepped up the attack. On the face and on the other hand, a small, sinister eye grows, and the small eyes of different faces sè, playing or defending or attacking the shè line, while coldly saying: "Only the seven cult priests can Can you stop me? I have killed twenty or thirty priests who are better than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? After confirming the death of the high priest, the spiritual defenses of these cultists and priests suddenly fell, and even prayed for power after "chaos", and they shouted, and they panicked and quickly lost their fighting power, being watched by night watchers. The priests and paladins caught and killed. There is no one leaking net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼. Recently, this inexplicable cult has been too many, and must find the root cause!" The majestic middle-aged man's face and hands make people The stunned eyes are closed and no traces can be seen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night watchman gratefully said: "This time thanks to the adults you are nearby, or else we are likely to be escaped by the priests after this 'chaos.'" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually. It's not just a question of escape. It will definitely be completely destroyed. Fortunately, this night watchman ranked third in the "Glorious Eyes" Winchel, traced from another clue, to avoid such terrible consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am responsible for dealing with the cultists, and it is my duty to deal with them." Winchel sighed. "You are divided into groups to search around and not let go of any cult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults." The night watchman captain responded respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterel walked in this hall, watching the chaotic altars engraved with female xing and male xing**, looking for clues for investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the magnificent but old-fashioned underground palace, looking at the dark but inverted corpse environment, looking at the ancient stone gate and one In the room of Stone, Winchel’s heart is inexplicably a little bit sighed. This scene has been encountered too many times. Whether it is the previous adventure or the action of clearing the cult after entering the night watchman, it is inevitable with the underground palace. Fight, secret room, hide secrets, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn ancient wizards always like to dig holes in the ground..." Winchel cursed, and other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his heart moved, his eyes became like rubies, and he made two shè lines, directly smashing a nearby wall to reveal the hidden door inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning a corner, Winchel showed a cultist with a horrified look in front of them, who were drilling into a secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Winchel sneered, wanting to escape from me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense eyes opened again, and one cultist fell to the ground. Winchel broke into the Chamber of Secrets and continued to advance, chasing the enemy in the forefront, behind those Naturally, the loss of combat power is handled by the clergy who follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chase, the cults in front are getting scarce, and then no one can be seen, but Winchel does not stop, his instinct tells him that there is still Big fish, the same big fish as the previous "elector." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, a stone door with a pattern was shattered by the shè line, Winchel entered the deepest secret room, jing looked around, but only here There is no other cultist in the "post chaotic" statue holding a burning flame. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come? Winchel looked around in a slight stun, as a golden knight, even though he was more inclined to cast spells, he was very confident in his instincts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cool breeze blew, and the golden knight of Winchel couldn’t help but shudder, and for the first time tonight, it’s dangerous. Premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This premonition is not strong, Wincher did not immediately escape, but played a defensive line of shè, let himself be surrounded by "bronze walls" under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, Winchel only saw lifeless walls, quiet and empty rooms, ordinary rough statues, and no source of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this cold and cold no one feels that he is guilty inside, can't help but step back a few steps, just then, "after chaos" statue holding The flame of the group suddenly plunged high, burning and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Winchel intuitively feels the danger of being inexcusable, a few hundred or even thousands of times stronger than before, even if he is often The night watchman who wandered on the edge of danger could not help but tremble slightly. He understood a lot of things. Before his own dangerous premonition was not strong, it was obviously disturbed by human beings, and it was absolutely impossible to counteract the existence of his intuition. Just like the priest just facing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a slight trembling, Winchel’s strong will helped him stabilize his emotions. The rich experience made him see the problems. This kind of existence is aimed at himself and locks his position. It is easy to kill himself, but he spends more jing power to entice himself to leave the team. Entering the secret room obviously has other purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" He whispered, and his eyes flowed out of the dirty liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the group is high in chéngrén shape, and the voice is old and hoarse: "I don't matter who I am. What matters is what I can give you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey. I am the Lord's Dark Guard, preferring to die and not dealing with the Devil." Winchel completely ruled out the possibility of the devil from this organized discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty room, the flames of laughter provoked resounding: "If you are closer to your Lord, better dedication to Him." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Winchel felt inexplicably ridiculous. There is also a dignified and doubtful heart from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the group became serious: "Don't you feel weird? It is also a devout believer and guard of the god of truth. Pastors, bishops, monks and parts Paladins can get the magic that He has given. Most of the non-priest-born night watchers can only rely on their own blood to fight. Similarly, most of the Paladin's magic is far weaker than the same-level priest. Why? Why is the God of truth and selflessness treating its guards so unfairly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nonsense, other book friends are watching:! We are Original sin, only through selfless dedication can regain the Lord's gift!" Winchel's anger seems a bit unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The flame sneered, "How much dedication you have made for the God of Truth, not to give the magic, at least to your knight's rank." Improve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
