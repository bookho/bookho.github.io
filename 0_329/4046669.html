			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the environment, Lucien found himself in a rotunda surrounded by a circle of upstairs seats, as if an enlarged version of the aristocratic house There are half a city-sized House, and the dome is shimmering with pale light, so that the dark and icy stone bricks reflect the demon color. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The left side is the passage to the outside, it should pass through the palace where the five members of the Lich King and the Northern Church are located, and the right is the road to the depths. The soul fireplace will not be too far away." After determining the environmental parameters, Lucien roughly understood his position and the direction of the two exits according to the law of coordinate changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to choose, Lucien does not hesitate, of course, to return. If you can meet the Speaker or the teacher, then security will be guaranteed. If not, You can also quit the Temple of the Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first Pope "St. Ivan" in the Northern Church and the other four saints "recovered", the strength of the two sides has changed greatly. It is more than a hundred times more dangerous than originally thought. The legendary prince and the teacher’s legendary peak are hurting, but there is no possibility of corruption. But they, Klaus and Elika will die if they are not careful. Good luck. Point, like the Sphinx of the Sphinx, was sealed, waiting for the parliament to organize more powerful forces to come to the rescue, bad luck, then truly become a figure in the history of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This should be the hidden danger of Bergner's prophecy..." Lucien said in his heart that he imposed numerous magical defenses on himself, "If you encounter life and death At the end, I would rather blew myself up and destroy five legendary items. I can’t hesitate any more, anyway, there is a tail at home!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the skin of the element, the mind barrier, etc. Under the protection, Lucien pushed open the door to the left, and suddenly the screams of horror screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to make sounds in the realm of the dead is undoubtedly legendary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are at least seven legendary undead creatures in the area ahead! There are more in the distance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The outside of the palace is a densely devastated natural disaster. The ghouls, ghosts, mummies, bone dragons and dragon lichs are flooding like the tides, covering the sky, covering the corridors and ramps, covering the lakes and gardens. Among them, there are seven strong breaths that rise and give people a chilling feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant palace, there is a roar of screaming and screaming with them, and it seems to be driving a "New Year Concert." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s scalp looked at the scene numbly, even if it was a long way from his own, it was quite shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use 'advanced time stop', let them be coagulated, go straight through this area..." Lucien analyzed the way, " However, the scope of 'advanced time stop' has just increased to tens of kilometers, at most it can cover more than half, unless it is used twice in succession, but there are at least ten legendary undead creatures coming from afar, and will meet me halfway... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, Lucien hated the broadness of the Temple of the Dead, so if the legendary undead creatures gathered together, then use "advanced time." "Stop" will allow you to safely cross them and go to the battlefield where the Speaker and the teacher are located. Unfortunately, they are so scattered that they are so rushing, "deeply" the essence of the three-stage attack, and their own "advanced time." Stop" can only be used three times after the time is raised to the second order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these unskilled legendary undead, one-on-one, one-on-two, or even one-on-five, Lucien is not afraid, but more than five. Volume change will cause qualitative changes, not to mention the fact that there may be hidden ancient monks, death servants and other strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continue to go deeper? Use the walk to let them distract, and then reflexively break through?" The Temple of the Dead is so wide that Lucien believes he will also provide himself with " The opportunity of guerrilla warfare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the prophet Begner’s words also appeared in Lucien’s mind: “If you are in great danger, remember, don’t rush back. Only when you move forward can you see hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the hunch of his own destiny and astrology, Lucien quickly made up his mind and watched the tide The "Desperate Scourge", the left hand pushed the single-lens, the right hand extended, the eyes dark, whisper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the "unsure hand" in the soul is launched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge fireball broke out in the "Desperate Scourge", a huge shock wave plunged around, and the gray-white mushroom cloud entwined with flames vacated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! Numerous undead screams came to an abrupt end, and Lucien’s sights in the sights of the undead were instantly empty, such as the harvested wheat fields, and the whirlpool that suddenly appeared in the sea, which was difficult to make up for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the seven legendary undead creatures is two less! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is trembled, shock waves and radiation flooded in front of Lucien, but he was far from the center of the explosion, after performing "atomic fission" Flying quickly, the body also has a lot of defensive magic, so basically no harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Atomic fission plus the uncertainty of the hand clearing effect is really good, but unfortunately those legendary undead creatures are too far apart, only locked one or two in the explosion core Lu Xien sighed and flew toward the door to the right of the circular hall. "If it is not so expensive, it is really possible to nuclear bomb wash the ground and let the undead natural disasters go to hell."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is "eternal blaze", Lucien believes that the effect will be many times better, after all, this is the principle of the sun, and the most feared of the undead is "twilight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going out from the right door, there was only a sealed ramp. Lu Xien followed the ramp and entered a quaint black hall, which was like a god. The temple is supported by a large black stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t have time to appreciate, and he had to seduce the undead natural disasters behind him, so he rushed into the only corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This corridor is too long to see the end, completely different from the palace that Lucien passed before, without a dead soul, dead and cold, like a solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a quiet, silent and quiet corridor, Lucien’s high-altitude and high-acceleration techniques are simultaneously applied, sometimes passing by in the air, and sometimes the ground rushes. Bypassing a sinister magic trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strange laughter came from somewhere, and it echoed far away in the empty corridor. It was creepy and dizzy, so Lucy. There is also a "mind barrier" to block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giggle, giggling, licking, licking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the laughter, there was also a clapping, and it seemed to be laughing at Lucien’s escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the "Fate of the Destiny" appeared in Lu Xien's eyes. The crystal ball in the left hand was incomparably dark. Suddenly, a starlight shone and pointed to a black wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique magic of the Nine Rings, "Maskillin Tracking"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giggle, giggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter came from the black wall, and it squirmed to the center of the corridor, blocking the way to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black fades, the wall becomes a monster, this is a pool of dark gray rotten flesh, it is made up of countless arms, hundreds of thousands of hands Extending from it, the palm of each hand has a yellow-brown eye, and the laughter is made by these eyes. The applause is undoubtedly caused by the numerous palms slamming each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundred eyes! Lucien’s mind flashed the name of this legendary necromancer, and its power and power also emerged. It’s blinded by its densely-eyed eyes, it’s desperate, paralyzed, and difficult to move. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its laughter and applause is its language, a uniquely confusing language that directly affects the mind and produces dizziness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this legendary undead is intelligent, full of laughter and ridicule that is revealed from laughter and applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
