			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the gangster thugs at the door of the road to the Sean family, seeing no reaction inside, so I rushed in and looked down, then quit to have ordinary, no The eye-catching face of the leader said: "Jackson's big brother, there is no one inside, things are very neat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson with a close smile: " It took a lot of time to swindle the bottom of this kid from the old Yan En, I thought it would be late, huh, huh, although Magma and Andre are fools, waste, but at least still have some use."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangsters around him listened to him and mentioned Mag and Andre, and immediately thought of the horror of Mag’s kneeling, and there was a wind blowing through the pants. Feeling, and Andrea, who stood at the forefront, silently rejoiced that if the kid took things and the money ran away, his end would be very tragic. Of course, he would have to lie in bed for a week than he was asserted by the doctor. Mag, it must be a lot better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andre you go in and look for something strange," Jackson told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre is going to show his merits and go in without any hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Andre’s face was eccentrically holding a lot of pieces and pieces: “Jackson’s big brother, this kid’s box has A lot of 'junk'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart lamented that these are things that have not yet been processed, and that they will be directly visible at first sight. Associated with garbage, if you know that you have sold goods in the market area these days, as long as you have the IQ of a normal person, you should be able to think of your own way of making money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am alone, and I am afraid of being discovered. Every time I bring back items, I can only earn some insignificant copper fair, but if The gangsters control the rubbish dumps along the river. With their manpower and familiarity with the market area, they may be a "gateway" of income, so they will definitely not give up, so they have to Also look for other ways to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson glanced at the trash that Andre was holding and shook his head: "I think I know where he got the copper, hey, The church is processed every three days, so that we have never thought that there will be a 'treasure' inside the rubbish on the Behren River. Courts, aristocratic districts, out-of-town manors, musician associations, blacksmith guilds, mercenary unions, etc. The rubbish can be concentrated in the Belem River. Oh, the rubbish in the eyes of the nobles may not be really rubbish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from Andre After Mag's mouth knew that Lucien had sent the garbage of the Musicians Association to the outside of the city, Jackson had this conjecture, but now it is only confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After publishing this testimony, Jackson smiled very harmoniously: "Thanks to Lucien, let us have another road that shines with fascinating money. So, thank us with our enthusiasm, to smash all the things in his house, find the copper fair, Yinnar to yourself, whoever discovered him in the future, and slyly thanked him. I can come to me to get a generous reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Jackson, Lucien is still far from the need to send people to guard As an organized, disciplined, and genuine gang, there are a lot of things that need to be busy every day, and it will waste time and waste people for such a small person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangsters cheered, if the house of Lucien was too small, the number of people that could be accommodated was limited, and they were afraid that they would all rush in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken sound of the sound rang again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that is hidden not far from the road can judge: "The jar is broken... the table is smashed... they are looking for me to hide The money..." Lucien’s fist was tightly held, and he said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Lucien also understands that more than a dozen gangsters are there, they can stop it, they can only be defamed and even killed, so even if they are angry again And then grievances, and then anger, and forced to hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No status, no fists, no strength, there are no ways to encounter these villains, rogues, rogues, scum, as for the law, from their arrogance I guess it is that it is useless if it is made by oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since magic still exists, dark creatures, heretics, etc. still exist, it is very likely that magic is not so discriminatory and repellent. I only need to be careful when learning magic. When I have the power of self-protection, I will look for real safety. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The danger is great, but the harvest is equally large. If you want to be rich, if you want to enjoy it, how can you go smoothly and not take a little risk? Even if you do business, you don't have to endure the exploitation of the nobility, the gangs, and the competition of your opponents. If you are not careful, you will go bankrupt or even die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times of peacetime The idea of ​​being pressed by Lucien in his heart finally broke through the cage and reverberated in his mind, just like the devil's temptation, so that he did not consider it at all, assuming that there is really a place to learn magic safely, why the witch still has to Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless thoughts, countless desires, in the heart of Lucien, but when he has not made up his mind, he suddenly heard the voice of Eliza: "What are you damn villains doing?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothing that the textile guild needs to clean is 10 points to collect, Arvin is arranged. After picking mushrooms outside the city, Eliza had not yet gone out and heard the sound of smashing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a long wooden spoon, waved, and walked to the Aaron gangs, trying to stop them from destroying the action of Lucien Lodge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get her aside." Jackson pointed to Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thugs who didn’t get into the house and smashed out, grabbed their sleeves, and walked toward Eliza, trying to frame her. To one side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they underestimated the power of Eliza’s amnesty, and the hand that beats the bear paw attack waved the spoon, and when it was heavy, it would go to the front. The gangster hit a hand and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson looked around with his eyes, and immediately two more hitters followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Eliza is not a small force, body weight and weight, it is very deterrent, but the opposite of these are the fists who make a living by fist, after a few She avoided the hard block of the key and dropped her spoon to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy punches, hit Alice's shoulders, even if there is a weakening of fat, she still makes a painful cry, but she did not back down Still moving forward, yelling: "You are going to stop, the sheriff will come soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the wall behind the road, see After being beaten, Alice was finally unable to help herself: "Is it still not a man?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I only "know" for a few days, I am The feelings of Alice and Uncle Joel are not too strong, but at this moment, Eliza is trying to prevent others from destroying their own cabins, but they are hiding, and they dare not come forward. It is really Things that you can't accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien clenched his fists and glanced at the hut before he slammed his head and said, "Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then rushed out, the goal is Jackson, who has only one person left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien, not far from the hut, rushed to Jackson near just a few steps, then slammed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Jackson responded, and his face turned to look at him in surprise, but he had no time to do anything else, Lucien He slammed into him, hit him and fell to the ground, and the two men twisted together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien used his body and his left hand to hold Jackson’s hands, not letting him pull out the possible daggers, while his right hand was desperately trying to Jackson's throat stretched out, and as long as he held his throat and held him, he could temporarily control the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Jackson can become the leader of the Aaron gang, not only relying on keenness and palpitations, he used to be a hitter, so experienced, while taking advantage of Rolling, not giving Lucien a chance to pinch his throat, while the pressed hand froze with his elbows, hitting the ribs of Lucien again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without moving space, elbow does not have much power, but the rib itself is a sensitive and fragile place, under the frequent attack of Jackson, Lucien It was painful to lick his teeth, but Lucien, who had suffered Gary's blow, knew that he couldn't panic at this time, he had to hold it, so he resisted the pain and his right hand finally touched Jackson's throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
