			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s mouth, chin, and chest were all stained with bright red blood. The safety guard’s rhetoric about his “nothing” was not heard at all. I am anxiously worried: "Mr. Evans, do you hold it! Is there any medicine on the body? If not, I have a bottle here. If it doesn't work, I will go to the Golden Cathedral and ask the bishop to treat you!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The security guard’s "loyalty" scared Lusien’s jump. If the person at the bishop level was asked to treat himself, it would be easy to find the abnormality of the soul. Difficult to pull out a bottle of ordinary therapeutics that I can buy at the church, slowly drank it, and then waved: "I am just a small injury, after drinking the medicine, it will be fine. And don't forget, I am also a knight. The self-healing ability is very strong. Although the assassin is powerful, he has been scared away before you can kill the killer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear Lu Xien speak smoothly , just lack of gas, mixed cough, this security guard finally put down the heart And then pull out the sword, glued to keep in Lucien side, there are other feared assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also reminded: "Mr. Evans, the blood of many dark surnames is very strange, even if the surface is not serious, it is likely Slowly and undetectable, corrode and destroy your internal organs. When it is completely erupted, even the high-level treatment of the cardinal adults will have no effect, so after dawn, go to the Golden Cathedral to find a bishop to check carefully. Once again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your reminder. I will decide on my own situation after dawn. As a knight, I think I can judge my physical condition. "Lu Xien faked stubbornly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." The security guard did not say anything more. Many people are like this. They are very afraid of death, but they are afraid of others saying that he has problems. They always have a strong chance of being lucky before the injury or illness has broken out. They are both afraid and troublesome for the doctors or church priests and bishops who go to see the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, I noticed that the moving Eliza and Joel rushed into Lucien’s room under the protection of a private soldier and saw his face pale. "There is no scary situation like blood outside the footsteps of "floating", only to hang a hanging heart behind the original place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor little Evans, which damn bastard is going to assassinate you?! You are just a musician, not a knight, not a pastor..." Lisa said with tears, and said, "Is it your competitor in music?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alisa, don't think about it, which music Can you afford the Assassin of the Grand Knight class?” Joel heard some information from the security guard. “Little Evans, have you found anything?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Natasha flew in with the Camille from the window, her nose twitching, and she seemed to smell the bloody smell that had not completely dissipated, so her expression became a bit strange, and then she was "extremely harsh" and "extremely strong". Forced to ask: "Lu Xien, what are the characteristics of the assassin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a black shadow, but it gives me a familiar feeling, it seems It is a cultist in the corner of the silver..." In the face of everyone, Lucien naturally does not say that he saw one. Clown, I saw a pair of black gloves, and then pushed to the musician Lucien? Evans has a silver-white horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is they?!" Alisa's bloody color faded, a little bit of a steady decline, and the experience of being kidnapped by the silver horn and cutting her fingers was her. A nightmare that is unwilling to recall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel held his hands tightly, and the low voice was extremely angry: "They actually want to retaliate against Little Evans!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the silver-white horn is perfectly covered with a black pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel and Eliza, who turned their emotions into instability, sent them back to the room and sent away security guards. Natasha smiled and said: "Lu Xi Well, do you want to pretend to be assassinated, or do you really have an assassin coming, and you are taking advantage of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Assassin, probably five The big knight, wearing black gloves and a clown mask." Lucien answered without concealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha slightly raised his head: "It seems to be a little familiar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is a night watchman Captain Clown.” Camille kept a serious face and simply replied, “I have seen him in several actions with the night watchman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;They have lived in the dark for a long time, and some have always covered their faces with masks, hoods, cloaks, etc., so Natasha is not aware of the specific situation of the night watchman in the Vaurit Parish, and also caused Lucien to listen first. There was no association when I arrived at the clown. When the Melzer Black Forest designed the night watchman and the silver-white horn fire, Lucien was not close, and naturally he did not know which night watchers were there, and which ones survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a night watchman..." After confirming it as a black glove, Lucien is half-deep and relaxed, and the dignity is that the church's night watchman is still eyeing. They themselves, they are like mad dogs, as long as they bite, they will never relax easily. It is he who uses this way to test that their suspicions have not been recognized by the upper level, or else they will let the cardinal pass by. The opportunity of banquets and concerts to quietly display a divine detection can make it very easy to draw conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille slammed his face: "He is a night watchman who survived the battle against the Silver White in the Melzer Black Forest."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For "Professor", Camille has no good feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be him, no wonder I feel familiar." Natasha, who participated in the battle, took a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much did the professor do to them? Lucien finally understood why the night watchman would persevere to trace himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it’s good, he directly tested the evidence that there was no decision on the surname, and the top of the church did not doubt you." Natasha smiled. Originally, I wanted you to be seriously ill, and someone else would direct you to the concert. Then, at the end of the concert, a generation of great musicians would be called to avoid the suspicion of the cardinal in the hall of the Holy Ghost. But now, maybe it doesn't have to be like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so good, although in the anti-magic array of the Hall of the Holy Grail, I can rely on blood power Suppressing the abnormality of the soul, not worrying about the problems seen by the cardinal level, but Cardinal Serge is a pastor of the Holy Spirit." Lucien deliberately did not adjust the injured internal organs, talking a little gasping, "apprentice in magic When the soul is very small, it is no different from ordinary people. It doesn't matter if I appear in front of him, but now I am already a four-ring magician, and it may be exposed when he looks at it carefully."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; Natasha’s expression is a bit dignified: “After the last lockdown, Cardinal Salde was completely reclusive, never participated in a concert, and did not host a large prayer ceremony, only the holy city of Lance He only appeared once when he summoned the cardinal group. Lu Xien, you don't have to worry that he will come to the holy hall. Even if you come, you will have enough time to pretend that the old disease has recurred and replaced the command."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be a bit worried about the status of Cardinal Sald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Natasha’s eyes became amazed, and her right hand subconsciously rubbed her chin: “Wait, Lucien, have you been in the ring?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the secrets of the Necromancer, involving Rhine, Lucien did not mention the fact that his magical power was raised to the Fourth Ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, danger can motivate the soul, as I did when I was in the sewer." Lucien explained this with good reason, Sa Cardinal Cardinal’s situation in the past three years is a bit clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! Lucien, you are two months old, but you are already a four-ring magician, even in the magical parliamentary genius. In the last hundred years of the generation, you are considered to be the most outstanding ones." Natasha has a heartfelt joy for the achievements of her good friends. There is no doubt. After all, this is the real strength." This shows your arcane days. The points are very outstanding, and the roads will be more solid than others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "I am still worse than your Royal Highness Princess. A lot. I remember that you were a big knight when you were an adult, and you were promoted to five at the age of twenty-one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s nice to hear Lucien Your praise, for the Cavaliers, is part of the strong will and the knightly spirit of choice. The mix of top blood is also part of it. I can be promoted to the great knight in adulthood, although I can't do without hard training and tempering, but mainly The reason is still the superiority of my own blood, but the advanced day knight is more willing to reflect my own will. Chivalry. "Natasha quickly advanced to rely on the blood of the noble no pride and no self-esteem, Tan sway admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
