			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of enthusiasm (June), the flowers are full of flowers, and Allinge is planted with a variety of exotic flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I went to Stein's Observer Castle, and I didn't find the Earl of Silvereye in the night plateau. It is said that I was gone, but the other princes could not 'Silver month, contact, so the plan to deal with Mardi Moss can only be put on hold for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the highest rated group meeting room, “Storm dominates” Fernando’s face is not Yudi informed of the results of his trip to the Dark Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a serious arcane urgency, it is a very annoying thing to be interrupted at the crucial moment of the study, and to take care of the overall situation. There is no substantial harvest after the dark mountains, and naturally it is inevitably unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded lightly and his face was calm and authentic: "Maybe going out is not a sign of euphemism, which is at least better than direct rejection. In time, Helkels, the 'Lord of the Hell, who occupies the body, spends his main energy on the forces that deal with the ocean at the southern tip of the mainland, that is, the agents supported by the Southern Church. This shows that his primary enemy is still Ken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no way to achieve the goal, but under the calm and unhurried attitude of big arcans such as Douglas, the other top members of the jury have no feeling of panic. It’s just that Lucien sighed quietly. The most important thing is that it’s its own strength, not an ally. It’s not that it’s too strong. It’s like a guy who’s vying with the source and wooing a bunch of strong people as ally and born and dead. I became someone else's plate lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to intelligence, 'The Holy Avenger, Melmos has already rushed to the south to endless the ocean, preventing the part of the church from being completely destroyed, but, The strength of the gods is that he can compete. It is estimated that he will give up most of the territory and rely on the magic of the core to resist." Oliver, who manages the committee, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook is in front of a stack of papers on field theory, which he just got from the Arcane Review Committee, which the committee members think is more interesting. In part, he exchanged it in advance to see if he could harvest anything, but he was only redeemed. The highest-level meeting was held so that he had not read it yet: "After initially solving the problem of the south, there is nothing to see. Dimos's other intentions, so we can't care and relax our vigilance. With the elf Wang Ting teaming up, with our current strength, although there is no way to go back to hell, it is safe to hold the defense line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This requires a legendary peak to go to the archipelago defense line and the "Elves Queen, mutual support." In the face of such a major event, Helen also rarely joined the discussion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked around the highest scoring group, see Lucien, Erica, Begner, Atumman, etc. Opinion, so the face is slightly dignified: "Safety is the most important thing. This time, I and Brooke went to the archipelago defense line, and when it was most easily attacked, it was reduced to a legendary peak."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion, where is the experiment." Brooke did not hesitate to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at Fernando again: "You should not go out during this time, guarding Allinge with Hathaway, lest the Southern Church sneak up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Aringe puzzle and the legendary peak, he did not worry about the Northern Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t had time to go out recently." Fernando complained, remembering the uncontrolled fission reactor and many neutron-related experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also try not to be active in the main world, lest Mardi Moss stare at the strangeness of the ancient devil, very difficult to guard against." Douglas finally 叮嘱One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire meeting, Lucian basically did not seem to be thinking about other issues, other members of the top panel did not feel strange, his injury has not recovered, There is no good way to face the "Lord of Hell", and it is inevitable that the mood will be low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the "Atomic Universe", Lucien went straight to the top and continued his magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien's mental strength was on the verge of exhaustion, so he stopped the arrangement and took out a high-end pharmacy "light of life" and gave a slight nod: "En.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Do you want to find the existence of the planet? Did you unravel the secret of the endless ocean? I figured out what is going on, what caused it? Natasha thinks about the focus of Lu Xien’s research during this time. The clear silver and purple eyes are both surprised and good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and walked over "I have harvested something from the data, which confirms some of my previous thoughts. I have a guess about what the state of the endless ocean is. So, I will use the proof that the planet cannot be found. The coordinates of the jump are adjusted and it is hoped that it will be confirmed again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it can be confirmed again, does it mean that the planet will be discovered?" Natasha looked at Lucien with a smile, and her voice was full of excitement.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From small to big, she kept coming from her mother Meredith, The elders Hathaway, husband Lu Xi'en and other populations have heard the strangeness that the planet can't be found. They also have simple and beautiful feelings like ordinary arcans. I hope that when I can really solve this mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart is like hiding a kitten at this time, constantly scratching her heart, and wanting Lucien to tell her what she thought. With what kind of speculation, Lucian had just said vaguely, obviously not intending to speak now, so she can only hold back her inner curiosity when she respects others.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope I can find it. "The feelings of Lucien are somewhat emotional. "In fact, the light is shining from the ground, and the universe is full of rays and asteroids. I have no doubt about the existence of the planet..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not simply to discover the planet, so that Douglas's celestial system is perfectly confirmed, so that the macro universe is truly presented to the world, but it means that a big mystery about "world truth" is Untied, so that the Arcanists can be closer to the "real" according to the answer of this mystery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it going to find the sun? Natasha asked, since it is necessary to prove that it is the sun that spends the least time and the most important.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looks out to the window The universe": "Yes, this will prove the shortest time. If not, you can adjust your thinking or turn to other guesses as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha walked to the side of Lucien, also looking out to the universe with colorful light spots, some "annoying" authentic: "If you can find The existence of the planet, perhaps you will get the most feedback, before I became a second-order epic knight, I will be promoted to the legendary peak. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epic Knight is relatively easy to promote in the first and second steps of the legend, so Natasha can become a second-order epic knight again in a year, but It is more difficult than the legendary magician to become a legendary third-order legendary peak. There are only five legendary third-order and one legendary epic knights in the whole world (“The Heart of Time” is behind, and there is another promotion recently) You can see <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don’t know if I can find the mystery that the planet is not discovered. It is also good for epic knights. You should already feel it and become After the epic knight, it is difficult to improve the blood by the tempering of the blood and the mastery of its own extraordinary power. This is because no matter what profession, at the end, it must be connected with the world, and make itself a 'real, Part of it reflects some of the 'laws of the world's operation, the same, not close to the world's reality, how do you know where to go next, how do you know how to get the whole life's change and sublimation? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi's answer is out of Natasha's expectation, he actually thought so deeply about the growth of the epic knight, and seems to be standing more Look at this issue at a high level.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s heart is warm, then habitually smirked: “Then I am waiting for you to point out for the epic knights. A light road, hey, can you really do it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know when you get there, but it may take a long time for me to tell you the real answer. Lucien’s mouth looked out of the window with a smile, and the voice was a little erratic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of July, Lentart’s third general school.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first grade of this year is beyond my expectations, and I am surprised by all the teachers, because from the previous monthly exam and class questions, his foundation is not good, but he During this period of hard work and hard work, we all look at it, he is..." Brian, the teacher who taught the basic arcane class, looked at the students below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
