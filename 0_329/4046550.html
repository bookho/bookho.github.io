			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille is like a wise but cold witch, regardless of Natasha’s expression, “without mercy” reveals: “I am very happy to see him. There are endless words, even if you can't find a topic sometimes, you feel warm when you are silent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Dagong, and Hathaway, When I talk to me, I can mention him once in a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is often normal to imagine that he becomes a female surname. Is this normal? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For him, you can deviate a bit from the devout position, not to stop using the action of the night watchman. For him, you can face danger and temporarily give up The responsibility of his body helped him to lead Prince Dracula and protect him from the pursuit of the demon lich. Is this just a good friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na Tasha seems to be stunned by lightning and another twist. The expression is very distorted: "But, but the names are different, cann't good friends help each other?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille’s blue eyes stared at Natasha until she saw that she was a little uncomfortable: “Really, the help is in line with the spirit of the Cavaliers’ good friends, but other Details and mood? I don’t say much about such an example. You are also a girl who has had emotional experiences and should be distinguished.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha face The distortion on the head gradually develops in the direction of darkness, and the subconscious is pacing back and forth in the room, and the pace is getting faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she gritted her teeth and crossed over Camille, and rushed to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Leng Qing, such as Camille, was also shocked, worried that he was too irritating, that Natasha could not accept, ready to kill Lucien or self-harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Natasha still sensibly stopped, she softly explained: "Natasha, love is no matter what the other name, this is your past I often inspire myself with a sentence. Have you forgotten it? You just like someone who just happened to be a female surname, so this time the person who falls in love happens to be a male surname and is not worth panic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While enlightening, she was somewhat worried, wondering if she chose the wrong time to wear and live up to the grandfather’s embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned slowly, but the expression on her face was beyond the imagination of Camille, with a joy from the depths of her heart, eyes Soft, cheeks flushed, between the eyebrows is difficult to suppress the excitement and excitement, beautiful can not describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Camille was surprised to know how to ask, and felt that Natasha had changed to some extent with her before. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she and Lucian escaped from the semi-god lich, and often fell into confusion and embarrassment, but now, this mood dissipated Most of them seem to have found new goals, so they are no longer stunned, and the eyes are as strong as the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled brilliantly: "Aunt Camille, don't worry about me, I will work hard for my happiness!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Camille felt that this was the day she was most surprised. She accepted it so soon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha made a fist in her right hand, very firm and tough: "I am a knight, I will not back down in the face of difficulties, but will find a solution." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is getting higher and higher: "My knight's creed is to move forward, advance, forever advance, and face all obstacles!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what attitude he is, I will not retreat. I must pursue him positively, kill him and conquer him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The heated declaration is to be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille suddenly had a feeling that it was Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s mouth curled up, and her left hand sneaked into the Laurel box with the name “Love and Beauty”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such things be entangled, self-denial, and problems should not be retreating, but trying to solve it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans's extremely cold ray" is the magic that Lucien built himself, so there is no need to analyze it. After stabilizing the control difficulties caused by the excessive increase of mental strength, Lucien smoothly built it into the soul. Really became a seven-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the window and look at the garden under the bright sunshine, Lucien suddenly felt a touch of happiness, the strength was steadily improved, and the exploration gradually deepened, the situation Relatively stable, the girl who likes it has gone from far away to thousands of miles. Although there are still many obstacles, the problem has always been solved one by one. This kind of life is a meaningful happy life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monocle made a little hot, and Lucien understood that someone was contacting himself, so he turned it on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, do you know where I am now?" Natasha's voice remembered after a slight current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled relaxedly: "Is it impossible to be in Aringe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I am at the Royal Tower of Holm." Natasha slightly appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up his eyebrows and was a little surprised: "Holm Royal Magic Tower? Are you afraid of church overreaction?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I am excusing to use such actions to appease the enlightened aristocrats. Who told the church to be a bad night watch? They must understand me." Natasha half-jokingly used the Queen's Domineering and answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of Lucien’s heart rises and blurts out: “Would you be able to do it in the evening of June 25th...”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the evening of June 25, you are free..." Natasha said at the same time with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two both stopped, tacitly and warmly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the customs of this world, oysters are celebrated from the previous night until after the morning, so that it is symbolic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Mo squatting on his chin, how can the smile on his face converge: "The Queen is your invitation, I am definitely free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, June 25th, to the Royal Tower of Holm, I will celebrate the oysters for you." Natasha said happily, "I have known for so many years. We didn’t have any oysters together.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a few chats, ending the call, Lucien waved his fist in his right hand: “Go forward again One step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he embraced his hands and walked around the room, his emotions rushing, a little uncontrollable, and couldn’t help but think: "Experienced this way. Many things, Natasha seems to have a good impression on me, is it time to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressing the emotions, Lucien took out the paper and took it Start with the quill and start writing the idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"purpose: with the secretly lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"Summary and Action Plan: The first step is to prepare the ingredients and do some drooling Chinese cuisine by yourself;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 2, Arrive in advance to the Royal Tower of Holm, in the form of a candlelight dinner, with piano playing, wine, wine, and make the atmosphere more romantic;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three steps, guiding the direction of the topic, looking for opportunities to use language temptations and hints, according to Natasha's response, there are three options: continue to hint, immediately confession and temporarily retreat;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fourth step, the detailed description of the three choices in the third step: If Natasha's response is not ideal, and temporarily retreat, then maintain the current situation, continue to cultivate a good feeling, never be hit, easily give up, If her attitude is vague, then guide the topic to the things she has experienced together, soften her resistance, and once again create a good atmosphere of expression. If her response reveals a clear affection, then she will not hesitate to seize the opportunity. Confession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;"Specific analysis and preparation: First, Natasha prefers sweets. The flavor of the main dish is tender and juicy. It does not exclude the spicy taste and the more eccentric ingredients, so you can prepare sweet and sour fish and blast. Stir-fried liver, roast suckling pig, honey-sweet pumpkin and other types of food, the ingredients are selected according to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
