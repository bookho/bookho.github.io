			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro has dispelled the suspicion of Leviathan after a series of previous incidents, convinced that he is only a "four species of the spiritual family" and has four The ordinary "God" of the great knight's strength is incomparably surpassed by himself at the peak of the Knights of the Knights. His heart is inevitably arrogant, but he is a high-ranking night watchman who secretly assassinates and fights many strong men. There are many dangerous situations. At this time, in addition to the smiles on the face, there is nothing wrong with the appearance and body movements, so as not to be amazed by Leviathan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his body, the heart, intestines and other organs begin to soften, such as the same beach mud, and when it is finished, it will be turned into a meat ball and the Leviathan will be completely wrapped. Digestion and absorption - As a matter of insurance, he gave up the intention of torture and prepared to absorb shallow memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leviathan in front is still "unexpected", Ramiro's ankles are hard, the whole person flies out, but then, suddenly behind the scenes Francis smiled slightly: "I finally caught up with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I X, the second time you were interrupted!" Ramiro Forcibly concealed the explosive power, and thus one of the cockroaches almost fell, and then he turned around, deliberately whispered: "Francis, you don't keep coming, almost scared me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was also shocked: "Is there a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis’s reaction to Ramiro’s almost falling I quite understand: "The door enters the core area through the 'Soul Bridge' on the Styx River, but whether it is the Styx or the Bridge of Soul, it has now collapsed a lot, showing a very terrible void state, so I turned around Go here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we don't delay, or else it is likely to collapse to no The extent to which the law advances." Lucien signaled the two to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis nodded, still the first to open the road, Ramiro went to the end, feeling depressed: "Before you can successfully follow the El believers, find An Hughes, Leviathan, who only strengthened the physical strength, benefited from the blessing of the Lord. He had the opportunity to kill Leviathan twice in a row, but it was destroyed by Francis. Does this mean that my good fortune is here? So far, has it restored the situation of doing things tortuous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000, is the beginning, but also the end, please help me find the right opportunity to absorb "Vantan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the corridor, the deep darkness reappears, and a gray-and-white river floating with countless bones flows from the far field to the unknown. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Styx?" Lucien looked at it curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiro nodded: "Well, it is said that every drop of water has a river of painful and venomous souls, don't be contaminated by him, except The underworld dominates, and other gods will go crazy because of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river is listening to a canoe, but the ferry has disappeared with the collapse of the meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did God's domain form? Material and consciousness, who is the first surname?" Francis sighed with philosopher's tone and questioned, goal Of course, it is the "senior ambassador" An Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the sentence, also the doubt of Lucian, originally thought that the Divine is something like the legendary magician half-face, just because the power of the gods is special, Only after the reduction and illusory changes, but after discovering that the meditation domain collapsed with the fall of the underworld, it began to understand that the difference between the two is a bit large, and the half-face of the legendary magician will not be destroyed with his own fall - the only The exception is that if this fall is caused by the collapse of the cognitive world, the half-plane will also be affected and destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiroppi smiles without a smile: "The power of faith gathers, the gods condense the surname of God, and the rest of the power of faith depends on Him and Him. The surname of God becomes an illusory divine domain. In the realm of the gods, the power of a god can at least be promoted to a level. If the deity of God and the surname of his god are not attributed, or the god who has taken the name of his god is not willing to maintain the domain of God, Then the divine domain will slowly break down, and the power of faith will be drawn by the surname of God and gathered around the surname of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of "the surname of God" that does not belong with time As time goes by, it will slowly dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a great spiritual scholar who is praised by the great El God." Francis smiled and set foot on the canoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien and Ramiro boarded the canoe, Francis forced his feet and the boat slid up, heading for the opposite side of the St. River, which was as quiet as life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, the buildings shrouded in darkness appeared in front of Lucien and others. This is a dark but magnificent palace complex with a stone pillar. Holding the grand dome, it is no longer as illusory as before, but it is very real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the home of the underworld, collecting 5,000 mortals to build in the meditation and let them bury them here. I don't think he will succumb to such a big palace. The valley moved in.” Ramiro said, both Lucien and Francis knew that this was clearly recorded in the underworld governing the code. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this primitive religion that survives by intimidation, blood sacrifices, live sacrifices, and funerals are inseparable rituals, especially when the priesthood is related to this and is subject to the surname of God. Those false gods that influenced, such as the former flame and the god of destruction, Afando did not do this kind of thing, but after becoming the god of redemption, the peace was much deeper and did not show this tendency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The palace is big, let's search separately." Ramiro proposed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis sees the darkness of the collapse has spread to the vicinity of the palace, and then consider the time of going out, so nod and agree, anyway, when you use your ability to quietly check The harvest of the two is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no opinion, just looking for opportunities to collect fine gold, secret silver, copper, ice iron, soul stone, blood steel, starry sky iron To refine the seven-element alloy unique to the elemental will, to repair the Holm crown ring, of course, the materials of the Silvermoon Medal, the Arcane Scepter, the Health Belt, the Ogre Gloves and other equipment are also collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the palace gate, Francis goes straight, Lucien turns left, Ramiro enters the palace on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Ramiro’s figure suddenly appeared in the hall, glanced at the ramp that Francis entered, confirming that he did not return, and then his face Gloomy body squirming, blended into the darkness, and walked silently like a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe that the chance to kill Leviathan will be interrupted by you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The speed of the Knights is amazingly horrible, passing the corridor, passing the room, and soon saw the sword holding the front, carefully guarding the search for "Leviathan" in every place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the corridor is a black metal gate with white skulls and bloody rivers. The death force from the underworld is almost completely gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is a regular steel sword, which is the reward of El when departing from Bethalhem, not in the storage bag. Frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a closer look, Lucien held a long sword in both hands, squatting in the middle of the white skull, then let go of the hand and let the sword entangle The final death force landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噗, when the steel sword fell on the floor tiles, only the sound of decaying wood landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the door open, and the eyes were brilliant, gold, silver and other treasures occupied the vast majority, shining in a candlestick Glorious, and in the middle of these possessions, there are pieces of metal of different colors, one strange item, one piece of equipment that flows with magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The treasure house dominated by the underworld?" Lucien saw the Mithril and the Soulstone at a glance, and the others were too late to distinguish. At the same time, the whole person was even more alert. The spirit is slowly unfolding. Who knows if there is a Guardian in the Treasures? Who knows that Francis and Anthony, who seems to have a problem, will quietly follow behind, kill themselves and smother these possessions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ramiro in the dark, seeing Leviathan seems to be blinded by the light of this treasure, staying at the door, a secret voice: < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he made a force and rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he just flashed out of the place to escape, and felt the other side of the corridor had a strange breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
