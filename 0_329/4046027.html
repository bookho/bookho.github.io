			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is in a very bad mood at this time. If the harpsichord can't meet his own needs, the newly written piano concerto can barely reach the holy shrine. The level of performance in the hall is difficult to satisfy the aristocrats, musicians, and critics who come to listen to their concerts. Perhaps afterwards, Wolf will be criticized in Music Review, and there may be no chance to be musicians in the future. The association or the Grand Duke’s invitation to the Holy Hall for the second time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many musicians like Victor who have seen many outstanding musicians every year because they didn’t get the imagination in the concert at the Shenglu Hall for the first time. Success, but for a long time can not go from "excellent" to "famous" ranks, and even some have been hit, since then gradually become mediocre, as for the unfortunate suicide because of the failure of the first holy hall concert, every There is always one in two or three years, and the spirit of musicians is sometimes very sensitive, slender and fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when he heard Lucine blindly interjecting, and by Xia Wei’s severe judgment, Victor couldn’t help but be annoyed, but he understood that Lucien wanted to help himself. It was kind, so he suppressed the mellow voice: "Luxien, thank you for your idea, but if you combine the harpsichord and the indoor stringed piano to solve all the problems, then things have long been It has been solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland looks at Lussie with a smile, as if looking forward to his answer, while Lott, Herodotus, Philippine Lisi and others looked at Lucien in disgust. When several gentlemen discussed the problem, they were not educated, and he was still nonsense. They cursed in their hearts: "It is really from the poor." District, rude, arrogant ignorant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in a short while, Lucien did not understand "Piano Production and Tuning" Modern piano mechanical principle" two books, even only read the first ten pages, but off The main difference between the two types of pianos and modern pianos is that they probably have seen the key points. Compared with the structure of the opened harpsichord, there is already a draft of how to answer: "Maybe some mechanical devices can be used to enlarge the finger press. Distance, to make the volume caused by the string smashing string become larger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said the vagueness, completely positioning his own level to an accident The poor people who have heard of two ancient piano defects in the Musicians Association and who have been exposed to the Alto music atmosphere in their normal life have not used more precise descriptions, such as the amplitude of vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magnification? How to enlarge?" Xia Wei's eyes are more severe, and the white eyebrows are squeezing together. These three hundred years of musical instruments are fierce, not No one has ever had a similar idea, but after a few previous failures, no one has tried it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the puzzled eyes of Victor, Rhein, etc., Lucien took a pipe flute from the instrument stand and walked to the desk next to it. Using a bottle of ink as a fulcrum, I demonstrated the principle of leverage: "I happened to see a farmer, using a wooden stick and a small stone to open a large stone, and later found that life is full of such a phenomenon, this is not exactly Is the distance between the top and bottom enlarged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Xia Wei did not refute, but thought: "But the speed of the string becomes Slow..." As a harpsichord maker, he quickly discovered another problem with such a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a bit of fun, but when Lucine’s presentation, Rhein became serious and serious, and he took a step forward and smiled: “ It’s great, Lucien, you actually found the principle of leverage in your life, it’s really good at observing and summarizing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s seemingly stunned, does not seem to understand What the Rhine is saying, but the heart is very surprised, what does Rhine know and call the principle of leverage? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Victor, Felice, Lott, and others, even Xia Wei, either don’t even know, or even noticed this phenomenon, There is no summary, no name can be called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The principle of leverage was summed up very early on Earth, and the general situation of the continent was derived from Aalto’s standard of living, and it was not surprising that the principle of leverage was found. Things may have appeared in other countries in the mainland, but because it is a world that pursues the power of God and blood, this knowledge spreads very slowly." Lucian secretly speculated that this summary of life phenomena is still not up to The taboos of the church, after all, the church with real magic is much more confident than the earth, and even the development of music has not been suppressed, otherwise they will not dare to stand up and demonstrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I know." Lucien said silently, but his face was smeared with a confused expression. "Really? Is this the case? Can you put this lever together?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is only prepared to say that the three-level lever transmission method is not something that a poor person can understand. As for whether he can inspire them, to what extent, he is not himself. Can be controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine Silver Moon-like eyes slammed: "Connected together? Multi-level conduction? Can try." So he walked to the harpsichord, Chat with Xia Wei in a low voice and find out what the quill and paper are drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking quietly at this scene, Lucien seems to be as strange as Lott and Felice, but actually calmly observes the actions of Rhine He said to himself: "He really has a weirdness, not a violinist or a bard on the surface."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is full of tension and expectation Rhein and Xavier were busy, and later they joined the discussion and provided professional advice from musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Lucien, Lott, Felice and others were left at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucine, who caused such a change, Lott was full of interest and finally spoke to him: "Actually, I have seen this before." Phenomenon, but never thought deeply, Lucien you have a rare quality. How did you think of it at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis though Also curious, but she pointed to the busy Rhine and Victor in the piano room: "Quiet. If you want to chat, go downstairs." Then turn around and concentrate on watching the three men's busy scenes, do not know looking at what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lotus has not yet reached the level of familiarity with Lucien, plus more interest in the transformation of the harpsichord, so he nodded, no Speak again, walk into the piano room and watch at a moderate distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Herodotus, Colin, Renee, etc., they are very upset about Lucien’s limelight, feeling dissatisfied and disdainful, naturally not He talked, but continued to look at Victor and others, faintly hope that the transformation failed, Lucian was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also very curious about the effect of the transformation of the harpsichord, and it is also related to the question of whether the dictionary can be successful, so Unhurried, read the two books "Piano Production and Tuning" and "Modern Piano Mechanical Principles". The three-stage lever transmission method is only an important point of modern piano difference and ancient piano, but not all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huang Liang, thick voice sounded in the piano room, then fell Down, it becomes delicate and soft, like a whisper at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, it's great." Victor's face is rosy and almost glowing, and he feels very good, although there are still many modifications in the harpsichord. The problem, but it has taken a crucial step, "Thank you, Rheinland, thank you, Mr. Xavier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein smiles: "If It is my pleasure to be able to make a wonderful musical instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the side of the road is more and more sure of the eccentricity of the Rhine, he not only made three The stage lever drive, combined with the re-shock lever system, allows the harpsichord to play quickly and continuously: "Fortunately, he has not made any other devices, otherwise I will think he has seen Modern piano."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor gave Rhein and Xavier a warm hug and walked to Lucien, arms wide open and hugged Lucy En: "Thank you too, Lucien, without you, we have a hard time thinking about it. Thank you, Lord, let you be at the most. The moment of the key gave us the most critical guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, Mr. Victor, I just said my own sloppy thoughts, I didn’t expect it to be true. It works." Lucien is not used to hugging a man, a little restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor let go of Wayne, laughed and said sincerely, "Thank you anyway, Lucian, what are your requirements, despite I am satisfied with the satisfaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused Lott, Felice, Herodotus to look at Lucien slightly, can It’s great to have Mr. Victor’s thanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
