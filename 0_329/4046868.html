			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "observer" castle, Lucien stood in front of a row of bookshelves and looked at a book in the period of the dragon's reign, which recorded the time Special customs of different ethnicities everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study is elegantly decorated, and the books are placed neatly according to the age. Except for the records of the mythical era, the materials of other lost civilizations are very detailed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this study, Lucien is no stranger, the last time he was taking the "deformation mask" here, but the castle garden and the boulevard The horror magic plants can no longer make themselves dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a library of souls, Lucien quickly flipped through the new collection of books from the Rhine while waiting for him to return with Silvermoon. In the case that the legendary powers such as Taikoolong, the main brain, and the eye-devil Lord are "from the heart wanting to integrate", the dark parliament naturally has to sign something like a contract on the spot, and the "notary" is undoubtedly They are wise and wise, always the right speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of guilty organization, only those who have not experienced a fierce struggle will hope to rely on personal prestige and strength to carry out hello. Hello, everyone. Willingness to integrate, unless the strength can reach the level of completely crushing the opposition, the correct approach can only be to take care of their basic disk, the joint swinger, unexpectedly smash the opposite of the backbone, and then disintegrate, swallow, absorb, deter and draw A two-pronged approach, otherwise, integration will only cause the organization to fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Silver Moon" this time with the help of Dracula, Danisos's conspiracy, although there is no way to eliminate the grievances and anger in the hearts of some legendary powerhouses However, any cooperation is based on the interests. This level of emotion has not been able to make the legendary strongmen die, and with the shackles of the subsequent magic contract, the Dark Council is the first step towards a successful and solid integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, the Rhine, wearing a red jacket and a black turtleneck coat, slowly entered the study from the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected 'Silver Moon'?" Lucien was preparing to ask about the mythological times, naturally looking for the witnesses of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein reluctantly sighed: "It seems to be boring, then disappeared, or perhaps against the 'food' of himself. For him There are still a lot of 'desserts' here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is often no such thing as "Silver Moon"... Lucien also feels helpless, often looking for The dark parliament, which is less than its own "president", seems to be "worry about the future"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein puts his hand and smiles: "But if something big happens, He It will definitely appear in time. In this respect, He will not be confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein. Can you summon the respected 'Silver Moon'? I have some questions. Ask him." Lucian made his own request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein chuckle and walked to the back of the desk and sat down: "We all know what you want to ask. So He told me about it, let me tell you." To you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Lucien was slightly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine Silver’s eyes looked at Lucien, laughing and laughing: “The moment you discover the sun, He knows that you will find it, Regarding the eccentricity of the endless ocean, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, according to normal circumstances, the depth of the endless ocean should be the same as near the atmosphere, it will not appear Walking back to the original position, starting from the model I built. It is almost impossible to form naturally. Therefore, I suspect that it is related to certain things in the mythological era. I don’t know if it is true? En did not insist on facing the silver moon, and asked if there was not much difference between Rheinland and Silvermoon. Instead of such a great pressure, I will always worry about what delicious food I have in the eyes of Aitna, and worry that he will not be able to stop eating for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein asked curiously: "What model did you build? Where did you see the anomaly and find clues? Lian Weiken this magic The teacher of the class did not notice the traces of human creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "... Mr. Rhein, do you know arcane?" Lucien indulged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and his tone became serious: "In the beginning, the consciousness of the ancestors was only half awakened, so the senses of the world are vague and close to the dream. In his 'dream', the soul can be independent of ** Like the light walking on the dark water surface, like the existence of some ghosts, and some magical creatures with ordinary extraordinary powers begin to change in the strange, powerful, mysterious direction, but no initial wisdom has formed." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened very carefully, the stage of the world's evolution and the process of biological evolution may not be consistent with the earth (the process may be inconsistent, but the hidden rules may not be Not the same, but here or a lot of some strange factors), and this is one of the clues to explore the essence of the magic world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the ancestor consciousness completes the awakening and begins to walk on the earth, the prototypes of many magical creatures have also appeared. The Lord of Hell and the abyss will also step. On the stage, starting from the instinct, set off a bloody storm." Rhein did not directly explain the eccentricity of the endless ocean, but gave Lucien an overview of the mythological era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prototype of the current magical creature, but before it has a simple extraordinary power... Lucien brows slightly wrinkled and stretched out, combined with the magic parliament Analysis of the origin of the world and the analysis of soil, fossils, etc., it seems that this natural simplicity and extraordinary power has nothing to do with the environment, only related to the strength of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien noticed a problem: "There were only three gods at the time, and there was no interest dispute between them, except that the abyss would attack wildly. In addition, 'Hell' and the respected 'Silver Moon' seem to have no conflicts? And it is only three kinds of gods, which are too nameless as a mythological era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time of its birth, the two gods only had the immortality of the gods. They had not fully grasped their own strength and will, and they were more seriously influenced by instinct. Moreover, the ancestors once told me that the potential gods at that time There are many, but only the three of them can be bred in the end, and the others all fail. For example, the ancient elves representing 'natural', such as the 'Blue Gate', are only half-awakened."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein explained: "Later, with the birth of many intelligent creatures, some powerful magical creatures have begun to gather 'the power of faith' and become a false god, just like you I have been to the same space "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the age of mythology, 'the abyss will' frantically kills and destroys, and the 'Lord of the Hell' hides behind the way to find out how to master its power. To the deeper level of ascension, those semi-awakening 'consciousness' are united with the ancestors against the people, and the false gods are looking for ways to grow, attack and annex each other, and are constantly lured by the 'Lord of the Lord' to become His experimental products to help him figure out why there are false gods, what are the forces they gather, and say, 'the power of faith' or the name of the Lord of Hell..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xinmo yelled at his chin: "'Hell Lord's name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but 'Hell' The Lord 'had never studied anything until the genius of Tanos was combined with the power of ancient devils and beliefs to create a path of non-natural gods, and seemed to find a way to become a true God. In fact, I have been Suspected, what was originally obtained by Tanos Early data is the 'Lord of Hell' deliberately revealed to him. "Rhine put down the quill, cross-phase shake hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How later was the 'Lord of Hell' and 'Abyss Will' restricted to the outside of the main material world?" Lucien was not in a hurry to ask The endlessness of the depths of the ocean, because he believes that this itself should be a different manifestation of the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein smiled and said: "After the confrontation reaches the peak, nature is a massive 'God of War', almost all false gods, a few ancient The spirit of the Elf Tree and the 'Blue Gate' completely disintegrated, 'melting' into the world, 'Hell of the Lord' and 'Abyss Will' were expelled from the main material world, and the ancestors could not walk freely on the earth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pseudo-God, even if there is a small amount of remnant, will certainly not escape the conspiracy of the "dead world" "kidnapping" or killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did this happen?" Lucien never understood this restriction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine points to the dark mountain sky outside the window: "In the mythological era, the dark mountains are not like this, there are not so many space cracks, but there are many different paths. The stable passage of the space, and the birth of a potential god, the same is true in the depths of the endless ocean. However, at the time, the depths of the endless ocean, the moonlight sea and the atmosphere, will always go through, just ' Look 'not the way to go.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
