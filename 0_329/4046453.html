			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next half a month, in addition to the people who can discuss the birth stars and the gods, the cities of Aringe, Rentat, Lance and other cities Peace and harmony, no waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this strange and calm, which seems to be just a normal sky, nothing happened, time went to the 820th New Year of the Holy Calendar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short holiday, Lucien took the gentleman's cane with the change of the "Sun Scepter" and thought about the initial formation of the "Aringe Telephone and Telegraph Company". And the promotion of alchemy items, while entering the door of the Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, the top hat was hung on the coat rack, and Lucien heard the trembling voice that Lazar could not control: "Of course, it turned out to be Artificial Planet?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The star that illuminates half of the sky that night is actually created and launched by Lord Douglas!” Heidi still keeps the little girl The crisp and tender voice, but at this time it is very sharp, it seems that the unimaginable Wei Li earthquake has smashed the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas Speaker published the experiment on "Arcane"? Lucien’s heart flashed a hint of enlightenment, and then smiled and said hello to the rigid Lazar and Heidi: “Hey, Lazar, Hey, Heidi, Happy New Year, you are coming very early.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the promotion of the Third Ring, Lazar has already had the "enlightenment" of the mid-level magician, each period of "Arcane" and "Magic" I want to see it for the first time - in the past, because most of the papers in the two journals of "Arcane" and "Magic" don't understand, and I don't buy the active surname, I occasionally buy a few books, most of the time. It’s better to go to the Arcane Library to read it. It’s better to pay attention to the Elemental “Organic Arcanist Monthly”, but now, because of the issuance of these two journals, he has only two days each month. So early, Lucien had no doubts about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the fact that Heidi, who loves to sleep late, can get up so early and make Lucien a bit puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans teacher, Annick promoted to the official mage level!" Heidi subconsciously turned to answer Lu Xien's question, clenched his fist, "I was stimulated I want to get up early and meditate! I have to get up early!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick is promoted? Although the communication satellite has not been launched during this time, Lucien is still unable to talk to the distant parties, but the many things in the early days of the Allinge Telephone and Telegraph Company and its subordinates, "The Voice of Mystery," consumed almost all of the leisure time of Lucien, except During the New Year's dinner, I talked a few words. I didn't pay attention to the apprenticeship of these half-student students. I didn't even find that Annick had reached the edge of promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also gives Lucien a wake-up call, and then considers laying the foundation and handing it over to a professional or a magician who likes to operate. After all, the most important and fundamental of his own is the improvement of the level of the Arcane, the power of magic, and the improvement of alchemy items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When was he promoted?" Lucien asked with a bit of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi clenched a small fist: "Yesterday! He has been busy with private experiments during this time, and even has no rest during the New Year holiday. It seems that there was a breakthrough last name. Progress, not enough mental strength to accumulate enough to rely on pharmacy to complete the improvement! If I didn't go to him and ask a puzzle, I couldn't find it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few months of adulthood, he was promoted. Annick is no worse than other magic apprentices of the same age." Lucien nodded gratifiedly. It seems that the electrons were shot out in the verification photoelectric effect, and Annick had A considerable degree of progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien’s whim is that he will not become the kindergarten of the Holm Crown Award (Silver Medal, etc.) in the future. Will there be such a record in "History of Magic" in the future: "The small place of the 'Atomic Research Institute' has left a lot of brilliant names, and there has emerged a forerunner who will be respected by future generations?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are papers that have discovered natural radiation in their own right, Annick may not get the Holm Crown Award this time, but continue to go on like this. Exploring the most cutting-edge areas of the elemental field is not necessarily impossible in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi once again punched hard: "I will not be worse than them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Annick, become a formal magician." Lucien smiled and expressed congratulations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, have you been promoted to the official mage?" Sprint blurted out, and he thought that several apprentices would be their first promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyria, Katrina also looked at Annick with amazement, joy, envy and inexplicable gaze, unable to believe the most silent among several people The most ignorant Annick is the official magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone looked at it, Annick’s face was red, and he shyly said: “Yesterday’s experiment progressed and the meditation environment happened. Change, I took the medicine to try to build a ring of magic, I thought it would be successful once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never received such attention, Annick is quite uncomfortable, almost I buried my face on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is verification verified to be electronic?" Lucien asked with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick nodded: "Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a glimmer of hope The results of the Holm Crown Award." Lucian half jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent pumping sound came from Heidi, Lei Yiya, Katrina, and even Lazar’s mouth. If you think about it, it might seem that there might be Such a hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday’s magic apprentice is about to win the Holm Crown Award, which is more legendary than the legend, even if the real age is less than 19 years old, get this highest honor Lucien, who was a formal magician for almost a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced the sound of snorting and amazement, Annick became more and more uncomfortable. He shook his head: "If you can't get it, it can only prove that the electrons come from metal." Among them, there is no way to prove the inside of a metal atom. For example, it may be that they absorb free electrons when they are combined?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said as if he said In a language: "And even if there is hope, I don't want to take it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Lucien asked very curiously, the others were the same So, some people do not want to take the Holm Crown Award? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick is very embarrassed to say: "I don't like to be noticed by others, so quietly studying, experimenting, exploring, improving, isn't it good?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have a winning day and you refuse to win the prize, you will receive more attention, this is unprecedented." Lucien laughs The idea of ​​Annick was dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also..." Annick suddenly realized suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lazar was only able to come back and lift the "Arcane" journal in his hand, loudly: "Everyone, remember more than half." Stars that were destroyed by God's fall just a month ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, what's wrong?" Sprint's attention was quickly transferred, then The impression left to him late was too deep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyria, Katrina looked at the past with curiosity, and the bright stars were still deeply engraved in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, who got rid of his gaze, sighed with relief, his face recovered, and then looked at Lazar with the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aringe, if anyone who doesn’t know the insider says he’s not curious about the newborn planet, it’s definitely a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lazar was ready to show off the big news and vent his shock, admiration, and hope, Heidi rushed to the ground: "The star is the speaker." Created and launched by you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Artificial? People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different exclamations express the same incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
