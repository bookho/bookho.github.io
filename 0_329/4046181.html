			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celly replied with a confused answer: "Jacques, I don’t understand why my father sent me to Holm, but I think he must be I think that the nun school there should have something suitable for me to study. You know, I don't have a knight talent. I was secretly evaluated by the Cavaliers teacher. Unless I rely on pharmacy, I will never be able to stimulate my blood. I have no ability to do business. I have tried. Hosting our bank like Ms. Ferrona, the daughter of Baron Monte Carlo, the result was a lot of losses, and my brothers began to be dissatisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to reading books, I can't learn anything, whether it's music, opera, oil painting or sculpture, I can get Jacques's love, you are such handsome, so versatile, good at piano, painting, singing, swordsmanship... ...is like the dazzling sun." Chely seemed to be stroking Jacques' face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kiss of the bark sounded as if Jacques grabbed Chely’s hand and kissed him. He was obsessed with the earth: “That time to follow Gaspar’s adult to the Viscount Adult villa, seeing your quiet reading on the terrace, I fell in love with you deeply, your beauty, your temperament is like a rose under the moon, so quiet and so beautiful and beautiful. You don't need What to do, just marry me and enjoy life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, Jacques, you...you are not a real knight." Sadly answering, the nobility must marry the nobility. "And I always believe that as a complete life, as a lucky person who is cared for by the Lord, whether it is a man or a woman, there must be the ability to live without relying on others. There are places that reflect the value of my life, so I have to work hard to find what I am good at. This is my little persistence, I hope you can understand Jacques."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques Some frustrated: "Celi, I am reasonable Your choice, but what new things can the Sisters School in Holm Kingdom learn? And I am very clear and understand that only by inspiring the blood and becoming a noble knight can you truly own you. For this, I never Fear, never worry, will work hard, will fight hard, but I am afraid that when I inspire blood, you have already married someone. Wait, Cherie, the Viscount will let you study in Holm Kingdom, is it Looking for an opportunity for you to marry the nobility there?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is whether the relationship between the Viscount and the Holm Kingdom is consolidating, or the church is wooing the opposite country. The aristocrats have a certain role, so when Jacques thought of this, he felt that things were like this. His voice was full of pain and despair in Lucien: "Is it true, Cherie? You will Marry someone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I really don't know... Father he never said..." Chely muttered confusedly Self-speaking, like a nightmare in the ups and downs of sailing boats, We have the slightest confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques punched a wooden box and almost let a row of wooden boxes recede and slammed into Lucien’s face, his desperate middle belt A little bit of wisdom: "Celi, can you wait for me? I know that Viscount and his wife have always loved you, you love them very much, and you won’t make things that completely disappoint them, but you can Waiting for me for three years? If I haven’t been able to stimulate blood power for three years, then I can’t match it, I can only secretly love you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Li was moved by Jacques's confession, as if to forcefully nod: "I will, within three years, I will wait for you. And three years later, as long as you don't give up, I am willing to be your eternal lover."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques hugged Cherie: "Celi, why are you Cherie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen The relished Annick suddenly found that his ears were caught by both hands, so he looked at Mr. Evans strangely, and they were talking about what they should not hear. Love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of lingering lingering to Jean-Sean’s confession, Cherie leaned against Jacques’ shoulder: “Jacques, find a chance to play” to Sylvie "Ya" to listen to me, okay? Now we should go up, such a big storm, my father may not worry about me, will come and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean thought a little bit: "Sylvia has been killed by Natasha, will it be a curse to play this piano piece..." Of course, no one knows the things of Silvia Twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, as long as you want, I am always willing." Jacques replied softly, then two people sneak back to the upper cabin...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Evans." Annick first answered with respect and then curiously asked: "Why did you just hold my ear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I am afraid that their love will destroy your unmature heart." Lucien answered with a serious look, "Even I almost couldn't resist it, like being thundered."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick thought for a moment: "But the love words I heard earlier are far worse than the dialogue between the operas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So I hate opera..." Lucien said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Returning to the cabin, Lucien did not lie down in a hammock to rest or meditate, but stood there, listening quietly to the waves Slap the dull sound of the Sailing Spirit, and listen to the thunderous roar of the roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The storm today is much larger than it was in the past few days, and the thunder is too dense and frightening."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician of the star system, the "Star of Destiny" and astrology, although not able to bring more accurate predictions, can already occasionally give Lucien a vague hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this sailing boat destroyed by this horrible storm?" Lucien couldn’t help thinking about the worst, but the storm was over In the case, the initial astrology could not be used at all, and it was only alert and alert. "I hope that the premonition is wrong. I have been wrong several times before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in my heart just fell, a horrible thunder of the bombs suddenly blasted, letting Lucien feel shocked, while the whole person has the feeling of weightlessness, as if to fly in a narrow cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sailboats are flying up by the waves? Or?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, one heavy The whipping sound was clearly passed in from the magical array, and the feeling of stumbling and standing was more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are enemy attacks!" Lucian, who has rich experience in combat experience and distress, has not been able to judge whether the sailboat is attacked by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of screaming in the air, and there is a scream of lightning in the sacred screams, so that all apprentices are aware of it, no matter how weak after seasickness, they all Concentrated near the door of Lucien. At this time, Mr. Evans, the official magician, is the pillar in their hearts. Even the most mature and quietest of them, Olmos, is also with a fearful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the door and pressed his hands to indicate that they were calm: "No matter what the enemy, now it has nothing to do with us. There are big knights and knights on the sailboat. , priests and divine arrays, they will be responsible for solving them, we just have to wait..." If even the great knight of the Viscount Wright can't solve it, it's useless to wait for someone else to rush, and can only hope to attack the "enemy." "Unexpectedly, there will be a magician who can escape with the magic of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calm and peaceful, speaking without hesitation, Lucien’s attitude infects the apprentices, allowing them to breathe deeply and calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another heavy attack, the sailboat violently fluctuated again, and the apprentices swayed outside the cabin, almost rolling around, and finally grabbed the door, etc. Stand firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱吱嘎嘎, the scalp numb, the sour teeth are clear out of the cabin planks, Lucien’s face is slightly changed, and the magical array is broken. What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea is up, Lucien is suppressed by storms and lightning to a small range of mental power is to sense that the outside is rising, it is so embarrassing It’s so majestic that even if it’s lightning, rain, or waves, it’s impossible to cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that it is a five-level deity, there is a bishop on board!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien once Far from seeing the captain of the night watch - the five-level bishop shot, probably can judge the power of this attack. In such a storm, using the magic and magic below the fourth and fifth grades, it is not going to pick up a wave, and there is a slight fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scorching whirl of the gods appeared, the whistling and sharp winds were suddenly heard in the heavy rain bolts. They were so concise, so sharp, completely different. The storm around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
