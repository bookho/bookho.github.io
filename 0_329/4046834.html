			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white envelope is delicate and smooth, and the texture seems to have a single flower petal. It is completely different from the postal department system and more like a piece of art, but Ali does not. Paying attention to these details, the eyes are completely solidified on the lines of the calligraphy on the envelopes. They are so familiar and so beautiful that Ali's heart is hot and I can't feel the cold of the early spring. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to go back to the classroom before dismantling. Ali walks in the cold wind and takes out a thick stack of stationery inside, carefully unfolding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I haven’t received your reply in the past few months, I am very worried, I thought you had any accidents, or there was a communication in the previous communication. What words hurt you, but you can't find a way to contact you. Fortunately, the truth of the matter is not what I imagined..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...our school There are two months of New Year's leave. When I see your letter, they have accumulated several pieces and have kept you waiting. I am really embarrassed... I am very glad that you can come to Rentatt, regardless of success in the future. I believe that this will be the most valuable asset in your life, just like the famous playwright Mr. Farham wrote in The Land of Thousand Lakes: 'Young is allowed to fail, so I want to marry this gold. Years to read a few more books, experience more things, look at the beautiful and cruel world.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In this change and 曰In the times, opportunities are everywhere. If you dare to dare to do it, you will always grasp one, but if you are afraid of losing Nothing to bear and face, it only allows the opportunity to slip through the hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you should live in Rentat For a few months, I don’t know what is wrong with me. What impressions do I have on the new things and changes described in my letter? When I read the letters I have read and written, there is always a feeling of fever, because at that time Full of embarrassment and passion, I can't help but describe them with the most gorgeous and romantic brushstrokes. After I can restrain this emotion a little now, I find that it is too beautiful to be too exaggerated, and there is no actual situation. Small, Ali, what do you think? What is it like in your heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I always thought that maybe looking for an alchemist In the work of the workshop and the income of the first few years, the general education school is not comparable to the Brooklyn school, but if you want to achieve greater achievements and open up a better future, then only the general education school can provide what you need. Knowledge, for the first three years, don't be impatient, Everything you learn is helping you to recognize yourself and understand what you are good at and like, so that you can madly absorb the necessary 'nutrients' in the next two years..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... In addition to learning, don't forget to 'integrate' Rantat, only by incorporating it, you can truly appreciate every detail of the changing times, thrilling details, which can make You are looking for opportunities, so I suggest that you often go out on a weekend break or work part-time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There is a street in Rose Avenue The side tea house has a comfortable environment and pure taste. It replaces the small band with a magic phonograph. Only two musicians are kept... The clown theatre in the administrative district often has a comedy that makes people laugh. The egret area is a slum but it is a slum. Those who have experienced rich adventures may have exaggerated words, but they are impressive. Whenever the night comes, the administrative area, the nobility area, the Queen’s Road, etc. can see the sky-like scenery. ... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly introduce the Rentat in your mind with a plain brushstroke, try to avoid the high-end luxury place, let Ali have a sense of purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter has no embarrassing place, full friends chat, not polite but pay attention to every detail, warm and thoughtful, just like every past Even if this is the case, Ali is also full of enthusiasm, read it over and over again, until the paper is taken into the classroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The 'open year' after the New Year's holiday is the second place in the entire grade and will be invited to visit the Allinge magician to visit the atom Institute... I have been to Allinge, but I have never been allowed to visit the Magic Tower. This time I have a chance. I hope the Atomic Research Institute is more dreamy than I thought..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali recalls the third-to-last paragraph of the shorthand, although she tries to write in a flat and unflattering style, but the lines in her words reveal her heartfelt joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Ali’s heart jumped up and he was about to announce the results of the monthly exam. Do you have hope to go to Allinge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the monthly test rankings are announced. The top 20 is the lucky one who can be invited to visit the city of the sky." Brian smiled and said that the atmosphere in the classroom was quiet and solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dow..." Brian began to publish the list, and every time he pronounced a name, someone could make a cheerless voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A familiar name is read out, and the sound of joy is heard, Ali is getting more and more nervous, why not? Do you really not enter the top twenty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ricardo." Brian read the twentieth name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without me, really without me, the huge loss hit Ali, let him really taste the bitterness of failure, the bitterness that has never been In the past, in the small town, although he had had a failed experience, he did not have such great expectations as he does now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 30th, Ali heard his name. This encounter made him frustrated and understood the facts, his foundation. It’s still too bad. It’s very different from those who have been educated for a long time in Lentaut or have been taught by scholars and magic apprentices. Although they work hard and work hard, they must keep this in order to catch up. At least one year of attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, many people choose to give up on themselves, because the starting points are inconsistent, how to compete? But Ali thought of Jane’s encouragement and thought of his parents’ expectations, so he quietly clenched his fists and vowed to catch up slowly. When others were working hard, they would work five times and ten times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of March, Ali, who was immersed in his studies, still used his surname to go to the school gate every few days. Finally, he received a letter from Jane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...You said that you were very interested in the knowledge of alchemy items and learned very fast. I think this is because we are all magical. The simplified alchemy items such as radios, magic crystal lamps, wired telephones, telegraphs, and the contents of the 'Sound of Mystery' are attracted to the general education school, so you can't blindly..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... If you are really interested, you can go to the school or the Rentit Municipal Library to borrow "Magic Structure", "Alchemy Elements", "Simplify 128 Common Knowledge of Magical Items". Books such as the History of Alchemy Articles, in which the "100,000 Why? Alchemy Volume" edited by the Prince of Evans has both a surname of knowledge and a surname..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the middle of the month, we went to the city of the sky, although it may stimulate you, but I still want to share my knowledge with you, I hope this will make you regret..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been to the city of the sky many times, but each When the rails gradually rise from the ground, there will always be a kind of shudder from the heart, fear, excitement, fear of things like ants below, fear of decline in fantasy, and excitement, if there is no magic steam train And the city of the sky, then I may not be able to experience the feeling of running in the air in this life. After all, not everyone can become a formal magician. I have studied arcane and magic for several years and still stay in the apprenticeship stage... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the long public transport car pulled us to the Allinge Magic Tower and there was a little fault, then the magic tower next to it Out of a steel golem, its eyes flashed red, even the car with people pushing, has been pushed to the front of the Allinge Magic Tower, and sometimes, the Golem is not only used for killing and fighting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The architectural style of the Allinge Tower is completely different from the towers in Rentart, but unexpectedly with alchemy cars, aircraft, magic steam trains, bursts Gun, magic air conditioner The magic crystal lamps and so on, it seems that they together constitute a unique atmosphere and style..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There was no seeing in the genetic laboratory Mr. Pei, it is said that he went to the Dark Mountain to collect species. I have no regrets, but my friend may be very sad because she worships Mr. Felipe and is determined to become a master of healing magic and anatomy. Doctor '..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the genetic laboratory is different from what I imagined, planting many common plants and raising many animals without special features. Well, the only thing that made me realize that the horror and genetic laboratory should feel like this is a partially mutated creature. In a laboratory filled with solution, I saw a scene of bloody horror, and some common animals mutated into Awkward and disgusting monster, can you imagine a mouse full of abscesses? Can you imagine a rabbit with two heads? Can you imagine dogs without fur? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
