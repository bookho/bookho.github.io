			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas in the mind that are turning fast, and Lucien pretends to be nothing, calmly closing the door and walking to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand is in the pocket, touching the "Avenue of the Snow", the will immediately becomes as thick as a regular break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Lucien didn’t give up this momentum, but he was restrained, because from the feeling just now, the other party probably didn’t know that he owned it. The magician of extraordinary power is not an ordinary young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the letter, with the help of this magical simulation, calmly like ice and snow, afraid to use a right hand to carefully open the envelope with a trap , spread the folded letter paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ordinary letter paper, the above lines of words are not like handwriting, neat and beautiful but still rigid, seems to be printed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Mr. Evans:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very honored to have invited Mr. Joel’s family. As long as you cooperate with us to do something that is not difficult to do, they will definitely live a happy, prosperous and beautiful life. When things are completely over, they will come back safely and well with the wealth that makes you satisfied. This is a Fair trading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, kidnapping, but it does not seem to extort money." Lucien resisted the urge to tear this letter, While whispering, carefully look for clues left behind, "What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the original lines of letters on the letterhead quickly become shallower. Then completely disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the original place, black emerged one by one, and soon a new line of text appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, you are worthy of writing the music genius of such a magnificent piece of music, it is different from the average person, just calm and calm, I am very satisfied. Repeat This is a fair deal and cooperation, not a kidnapping. Of course, if you sell us, you will never see Mr. Joel's family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is a supernatural power! It is even more difficult to blindly expose the things that I will magic. Only then will there be a chance to save Uncle Joel from them!" As a magic apprentice who has contacted undead creatures such as grievances, water ghosts, etc. The strangeness of the degree can not scare Lucian, but instead makes Lucien more calm, and does not believe in the so-called transaction and cooperation. It is very certain that this is a kidnapping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When facing the kidnappers, the most important thing is to never believe that after the completion of the request, the kidnappers will send the hostages safely back, the body is possible, so Lucien was the first to decide not to be kidnapped and start planning to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the premature acceptance of the procrastination of time is still necessary, Lucien took a deep breath and pretended to be a calm and calm look, whispered: "What do you want me to do? And how do I believe that you will guarantee the safety of Uncle Joel, maybe they have been killed by them now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Toughness is also an indispensable means of negotiating to ensure the safety of hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words on the envelope disappeared again, and new ones appeared:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What we asked for It's very simple, that is to give full play to your musical talents, create more and more outstanding works, and become the long-term music consultant of His Royal Highness Princess Natasha. This will make you such a complex and great music in three months. The musical genius should not be difficult, and it is very consistent with your goals and future path. You see, as a partner, we always think about Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the safety of Mr. Joel's family, please rest assured that killing them has no benefit to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien There are a lot of thoughts in my heart: "Does their goal be Princess Natasha, or do they get some secrets from Lata Summer Palace by contacting the princess? Or is it a dispute that deprives some nobles of inheritance after being trusted by the princess? I was only yesterday The princess invited to be a short-term music consultant, and today someone has kidnapped Joe. ?? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp an uncle to blackmail me, such a reaction rate, are among them people who were present would be "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The writing continues to change: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, I think you need to figure out one thing, you are just one of our attempts to achieve our goal, we still have many ways You are not as important as you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sneered: "Then kill me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the word has faded, it has not appeared for a long time. It seems that the attitude of Lucien is also a bit tricky. They think that Lu Xien is a poor young man with musical talent. It should be so strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is slowly passing, and a few minutes of waiting gives Lucien an illusion that the other party has left, but Lucien bites his teeth and does not speak. This is a patience. when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the envelope once again highlights a few lines of black words: "We will show you the 'view' of Mr. Joel’s life every once in a while, tomorrow I started the first time. However, your attitude has angered us. Tomorrow, in addition to the 'view', there is a finger of Mr. Joel, I believe you will recognize it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard." Lucien cursed his teeth and said, "Your 'view' must include complete time and period features, or else you use this evil, terrible power. The 'view' of the production is likely to be just the same day, and then pretend to be part of the different periods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has accepted the requirements of Lucien, After the addition of the part, the other party only agreed to agree for a minute: "No problem, now, Mr. Evans, can you cooperate with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When you see it tomorrow, you will cooperate with you. Do you need me to swear?" Lucien pretends to be ignorant of the extraordinary power, and the heart is quietly clenching his fists. As long as he has the characteristics of time and period, he has certain hopes to judge the place where Uncle Joel’s family is held. After all, they need to use The surrounding environment is expressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new black font appears: "A mortal vows is for violating, and the oath of true testimony will leave marks on you, will make you church and The sacred array of Lata Summer Palace is identified, so as long as you promise, you will observe it in secret. Don't expect to be able to pass us. Also, don't think about reporting to the Princess, believe me. As long as you say it, for a minute, the Joel family will die completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is vaguely written, mysterious, and fearful. I don't know if the last sentence is to express the people around them with the princess, or the strange telepathy that is not easy to be discovered. When they say certain words, they will be directly known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to being a longtime music consultant for the Royal Highness, what do you really need me to do?" Lucien knows that the purpose is often to expose motivation, and the motivation can often Let guess the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The font has become scribbled: "If you hear something interesting at the La Taxia Palace, and the schedule of the Grand Duke and the Princess, we are happy to know. You only know You need to write it down with a quill on this piece of paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s awkward, or there are no reductions in the purpose, no real motivation Lucien nodded. "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black font of the scribbles emerged, but not as clear as before: "Mr. Evans, you are wise." If there is anything you need, you can ask us and hope that we can have a good cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The font disappears completely and never appears again. Lucien has only one Blank stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, under the "Ice and Snow Vengeance" will, Lucien felt a slight loss of supernatural power fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folding the white paper into the envelope, Lucien looked blankly at the closed wooden window, with anger and hatred in his heart: You certainly can't think of it, I have already recognized you? The cultists in the silver-white corner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning when the envelope was removed, Lucien was " With the help of the ice and snow Avengers, the more sensitive mental power, it was found that there was a small amount of supernatural power on the stationery, so while talking to the mystery, Lucien was analyzing the composition of this supernatural power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
