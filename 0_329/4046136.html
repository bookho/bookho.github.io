			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salder, who holds the "Sun Scepter", is not eager to attack, but is fully unfolding the sacred array of sacred sacs. The battlefield brought another space. Since there is a home court benefit, he naturally will not let the two legendary battles ruin the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time he replied with a smile: "The Lake Elsinore and the Royal Highness Princess, there is no need for you, Tiffithis, you are worried, of course, someone helped me with this. The old guy handles, I am patiently waiting for you to break free of the seal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Tiffididis heard a strange look from the German language. At the same time, its "ice aura" expanded toward the surrounding area, easily blocking the magical array, but it did not see other cardinals or the head of the church knight, so thought of a possibility, "Yaluolan? Heather Wei Sald you have cooperated with the Arcanist! You actually helped her to return early from the alien space?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde smiled very well: "There are no friends forever, no enemies forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a little and continued: "Only the glory of the Lord can shine forever, for the Lord's The land of the land, the temporary cooperation with the magician is not something unimaginable. Lord Tiffidis I am very interested in you, the singer of the legendary magician such as Maskillin and the secret of the 'death world'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, human beings are really greedy. No wonder you know my plan, and I haven't let the pope and other cardinals pass through the transmission." Tiffididis's pale horse smiled and leaned forward. "Do you think? With your own and Aalto's divine array, can you counter the true coming of me? Changed Yalo Blue? Hathaway is almost here! I think you must not tell her the secret."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the main material world is difficult to transmit, the important place of the Holy City is definitely a two-way transmission with the holy city of Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde did not pay attention to the ridicule of Tiffidis, as mild as the next-door grandfather: "It’s not just me who wants to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of crisp and loud shoes came from behind Teventis, in the air, the black shirt, the red coat of the Rhine is like walking on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A small vampire who did not reach the legendary field dared to come and marry this kind of thing." The silver-white Lord Tiffidis sneered disdainfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two pairs of huge black bat wings that swell behind the Rhine, enveloping half of Aalto, and the feeling of darkness and evil is in harmony with the holy and pure light. Very incomparable, but his eyes are still beautiful like silver moon, not as bloody as other vampires: "I haven't seen you for so many years, Tiffedis you seem to have forgotten me, I hope you will not be so forgetful in the future."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of Silvereye of the Observer." Tiffedis recognized his identity from his seemingly eternal eyes and became serious, even though it was the real body. However, it is only free from the seal, and may not be able to deal with the legendary array of two legends plus Aalto's strict arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............over the Lake Elsinore, surrounded by the enemy Cardinals, gold knights and vigils did not do anything, just watched Erie with vigilance Ya and the black robe monster that the bloody liquid condenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of them, the sky stood a man and a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's brown hair, dark blue eyes, wearing black magic robes, turned out to be "Rogerio" that Lucien had seen, should be with another day The Cavaliers killed Camille's "Rogerio"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression at this time is very indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beautiful woman is beautiful, with an impressive pair of silver-gray eyes, she is wearing a deep purple magic robe, pointing facelessly at a stunned Ely The priests and the dark knights of the Arabian and White horns spit out two short words full of magical mystery:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Element decomposition."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, Ilya, the seven-level high priest, felt that his body had split into a variety of strange substances, with black solids, vigorous gas, and a little greenish phosphorus fire. The smell of sulfur and so on, even his accumulated magic power is also irreversibly decomposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monsters in the black robes are also broken down into red, black, white, and gray four-color spots, but those spots have not disappeared, and they return to the body that condenses them...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apsisis, return to your skeleton wasteland." The lady with silver-gray eyes is concise, and the black robes monster suddenly appears in front of an unreal door like black velvet inlaid with countless diamonds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe monster looked at the opposite woman deeply, measured the condition of being sealed for many years, and stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lake Elsinore has returned to calm, the adventurers in the town of Bonn have died, and the townspeople are much better because they are just sleeping There was no time to become an undead, and when the undead began to kill, the church rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can leave." The lady who fired the black robe monster said to the strong people around her as if she were telling her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorton, Hayward, Lafayette and other strong people did not refute, silently turned and left, returning to Aalto, although I don’t know why she appeared Here, but not broken down by her is the Lord's blessing. In particular, the bishops of the truth gods have been scared too much. Under normal circumstances, her enemies should be their own talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchers on the ground looked up at the lady, as if to remember her appearance, but in the "purification sequence" The 16th Arcanist "Elemental Dominator" Yallo Blue? Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the church and the Principality left, the indifferent Rogerio stood in front of Hathaway, angry but controlled geological question: "Great Arcane Your Excellency, this is the decision passed by the highest scrutiny of the parliament. How can you violate it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's silver-gray eyes glanced coldly at Rogerie O: "I didn't agree with the decision. For me, it was a piece of waste paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of the Arcane Master..." Rogerio tried According to reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather has turned and indifferently "and you forgot that every Arcanist has veto power. Also, things inside Holm King's interior I don't want anyone to try to intervene, or else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words disappeared in the air without saying it, and Rogerio’s expression suddenly became It's easy to get up, not as angry and disappointing as before, and involved in the battle between the big arcans. Even the Archmage will have a headache, and it is good to be able to pass through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the wilderness outside the Melzer Black Forest, a corpse fell to the ground, they were like a leaky ball completely 瘪Going down, the facial expression is blue and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille’s right hand in the black court dress pinched Verdi’s neck and raised him in the air: “You don’t know where Natasha fled. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildi has no resistance, but he will converge on despair and other emotions, sneer: "She fled into the Black Forest, perhaps already by my The Cavaliers caught up and killed. Camille, is my father instructed you to assassinate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to die." Camille is like Usually cold and whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdi’s body suddenly swelled, and then slammed open, numerous dark blue water jets squirting through the holes in his skin, and then quickly dried up. His face suffocated like a cyan color, but there was no trace of regret in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille flew up and looked for Natasha and others in the Black Forest. Black forests are densely populated, there are so many strange plants, and now it is the darkest time before the early morning. This kind of search is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore Camille simply stopped, following the traces of Natasha and others into the forest from the ground. Fortunately, the time did not last long, she was barely able to distinguish the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where Lucien and others were separated, Camille hesitated because both sides had the smell of Natasha blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Ghost Aloe is completely different from ordinary aloe. It has five long leaves, pale and yellow, dry and dew, full of wrinkles. The front part of each leaf is a transparent long thorn, which is just like the palm of a ghost with a sharp nail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
