			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellar just stepped into the Atomic Research Institute and was shocked. Lucien was beside a big monster, and the whole body was covered with transparent and beautiful scales. lizard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon?" Bellak recognized the most famous magic creature in a few seconds, and as a high-ranking magician, he was very It was soon thought that the storm dominated the dragon student, so he took off his guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris raised his head and screamed arrogantly, dismissing Barack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw Afris, who was just as charming as a puppy, became arrogant and shook his head in a funny way: "Belac, there Did the preliminary investigation result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the preliminary investigation, the magicians who sent the cursed items did not have any suspicion, they are all in 'Lo The small shop of the class 'purchased the gift, and after selling the goods, 'Luoban's small shop' has not opened the door, the boss 'Loban' does not know whether it is dead or alive, but it also completely eliminates the misuse of special materials. The possibility of a gift." Bellak took out the notebook and officially informed the "Evans Committee" about the preliminary investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although high-level magicians can't arbitrarily invade the brain, read memory, and weave memories as the dead soul dominates, they can only extract the most memorable part of the memory. But it does not prevent them from using the dreams and other illusions to interpret the answers from the middle and low-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if death is alive? That is, I don't know if 'Loban' was used by people, or as a mastermind to escape in advance..." Lucifer En is more inclined to the latter, otherwise some parts of the entire assassination process will have to rely on luck, and do not meet the premise of careful planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berk turned the record over one page, affirming Lucian’s thought: “Preliminaryly determined that Loban was fully involved in the process, because according to those The magician recalled that they were all embarrassed when they bought the common pharmacy in the regular alchemy shop, and they came up with the idea of ​​going into atomic research. So they listened to Loban’s suggestion, and you discovered the electronics and opened the micro-world door. The opportunity to come to congratulate and make a good relationship. As for the small gift, I will definitely buy it according to Loban’s recommendation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custom of the Parliament and the Kingdom of Holm is No gifts, but when you visit, you can bring a small gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Loban does have a lot of suspicions. The purpose is very clear. Is there any information about him?" Lucien held his right elbow in his left hand and rubbed his chin in his right hand. Waiting for more information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afris next to it is too lazy to keep the image, slowly slammed to the ground, eyes seem like open, just fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barack once again turned a page: "Loban, the Lentat of the Holm Kingdom, who lived here since his grandfather, at the age of twelve He was discovered to be a magical talent, and he was sent to the 'Aringe' magic school to graduate with a good grade. After four years, he was promoted to the official magician. He is good at light and dark, astrology, elements and alchemy magic. How long does it take to risk a severely damaged and 'incomplete' soul in an outing adventure, and there is no way to increase the level of magic, and he is not good at arcane research, so he opened an alchemy store in Aringe."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His surname is solitary, silent, single, no children, his parents have passed away, relatives have basically no contacts, few friends, but according to the survey, the last five years of the Luoban family have The benefits, the mood has become more peaceful. He disappeared two days ago, may be running ahead, there is no clue, the disciplinary department is mobilizing the high-level magician who is good at astrology for prophecy. I initially suspected that he was developed into the night watchman team. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other direction of investigation?" Lucien frowned slightly, and Loban disappeared. The whole thing seems to be over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellak maintains a meticulous and solemn attitude: "I am still investigating where Roban is buying or getting special materials, maybe catching more spies. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although this assassination is over, the Panel is still not worried about the safety of Evans, so I will serve as your guard three." In the month, you will spend the most dangerous time. At Aringe, you can move freely without thinking about me. I am only responsible for checking the environment and items, but if Evans is leaving you, it is best to leave Allinge. Tell me the itinerary, I report it to the panel and follow the protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Barack checked other items in the office, Aphras slammed up, and the translucent amber pupil looked at Lucien with a good look: "I am better than him! I can also be a guard! Just give me a A beautiful Holm crown ring, I can sign a ten-year contract for sale! The contract I signed last time has been completed, don't worry about other problems, sign me, boss!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that once you said, give you a Holm crown ring, you can sign a hundred years of sales contract." Lucian teased it funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphras stunned, the amber eye turned: "Is it? It must be that I just woke up! Boss, you are going to have a few Holm Crown Ring, as well as the Immortal Throne Talisman, Ice and Snow Medal, Silvermoon Medal..." Speaking, it flows out of suspicious liquid at the corner of his mouth, and quickly rubs his claws. "Get one and hire me." It’s not worthwhile to play and can do experimental materials and be a chef’s genius dragon? I will be much more!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, it’s your own honor. How can you hire it to hire you?” Lucien’s “long-mindedness” is authentic. “And they all have high-order magic, which is very useful for me and safe to wear on my body.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can they have me? I will have a lot of high-level magic, but also melee!" Aphras spurs himself, "especially in the realm of mind, spirit, and soul. Magic, I am very good at it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is honor, unless I wait to be Master or legendary magician, these bonus items only have collectible value, you can consider lend you play two or three centuries. "Lucien driving a" blank check "temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three hundred years? Aphre's eyes are bright, as a little dragon that has only been for decades, it feels that he has already taken possession of it, and when he borrows it, he can borrow it again. Anyway, the item is in his own hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It coughs, pretending to be deep and profound: "If you can become a great mage, it will be a lot of things after many years. This kind of commitment has no value, I like So stupid dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article has learned Fernando's idioms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not hiring you in vain, I will pay you every month." Lucien is now quite "rich", experimental materials, practice exercises Consumption can be borne by the Institute of Atomic Research. Jinluo’s monthly dividends are close to 3,000, which can fully satisfy the needs of purchasing medicines, redeeming magic, borrowing books, and even more than enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, after becoming a high-level arcane master, Lucien was able to receive a total of 380 arcane points from the parliament, and the element will give three Hundreds, plus the Arcane Review Committee's monthly 1,500 Arcane points, can be comparable to most high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is about to get a number of "big prizes", there is no need to refine and buy magic items, so even if you hire a dragon, you can For the preparation of high-level rituals and the construction of the magic tower, you will make a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very expensive." Affris emphasized one sentence, then sticked out a bright red tongue, and pressed the back of Lucien's hand in a moderate manner." Boss, how much do you prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In January, two thousand Jintal, when you don't go out and don't need you to do experimental materials, you have absolute freedom. You can continue to earn other people's shiny gold coins." Lucien's tone is full of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you do other things? When you become a Master or a legendary magician, you can also borrow your Holm Crown Ring, Immortal Throne, Silvermoon Medal The Ice and Snow Medal comes to 'play'?" Aphrodite's translucent eyes swelled and slammed a piece of parchment from his belly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Boss, we have signed for a hundred years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very "satisfied", two thousand Jintal can hire a illusion level may have seven rings The dragon is really worthwhile! Then he asked casually: "Aphrodite, can you use the Arcane point as a salary?" This is mainly because of fear of Aphrodite as a dragon. I definitely prefer the sparkling coins, gems, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Arcane point? Of course there is no problem! I can buy my favorite gems and crystals myself!" Aphrodite took magic out of his belly. A seven-ring black ring badge, while looking at Lucian with a little doubt, "Don't you like the easy-to-transport, easy-to-carry arcane point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
