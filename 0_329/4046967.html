			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, you can arrange freely." Anord looked up and down Douglas with a smile, did not hide his expression, it seems to re-recognize this now. A small singer who is a few hundred years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Plyhill was like a tulip, swaying and coming over, with a smile on Douglas: "You, um, how? What? The angle and way of thinking about the problem is very surprising. Indeed, some phenomena are full of our lives, let us get used to it like we are used to our hands and eyes, and forget to ask why this is the case." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For more than five hundred years, I once again felt the shock of the initial contact with magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the enthusiasm of this warm lady, Douglas can only smile and nod: "The exploration of the world of magic is endless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's not delay Plyhill didn't mean anything, smiled blankly at other people. "The most important thing at the moment is to assassinate Alfonso. After you go back, follow the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Plan? Fernando’s mouth twitched. The old guys had even planned the plan when they communicated privately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat and bloated Nelson looked at Douglas with the ruby-like eyes and snorted: "Anthony's magician is studying this problem?" No wonder it will be overcome by the Church of Truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas did not argue with him, and clearly remembered that this is the remains of the Arthur Empire, the best is the blood Fusion and ** transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, I often wonder, what is the power of the shadow, from where..." Amanata voice whispered. Then the whole person disappeared into the shadow in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus looked at Annod, using a consistently hoarse voice: "Old fox, I will do what you say, but if your plan Something went wrong, oh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the leaders of the organizations leave, Anord dug up his nose without image: "and This group of guys is more involved than fighting them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basis of no trust can only be step by step." Douglas smiled and didn't mind. such. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This action is the first step in trust, thanks to the 'dark blue demon', whether or not he really wants to kill Alfonso. At least It gave us the opportunity to act together. For the first time, it would be easier to organize the second and third time.” Anord restored the smile and the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not say good-naturedly: "But it must be successful! If it fails, it will be difficult to have a second cooperation. Unless one party is nearing extinction. Old man. What is your plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only Annold and Douglas, so he shouted out the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod did not blame Fernando’s impoliteness, smiled and said: “It’s very simple. I’ve said it before, it’s led by the Tower of the Destroyer. Alfonso, other organizations cover and cooperate with us, the church must have thought that we have united."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to lead? Not afraid of the church suspected of traps? Not afraid of Come to the 'heart of time'? He has been arresting the magician recently.” Fernando is dissatisfied with the plan, even if the church does not know that so many magic organizations have been secretly united, can be slightly harder and easier to see. There are traps, and it is very likely that you will encounter a Thunder strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold looked at Fernando with a smile: "You are just a seven-ring magician. This kind of combat is not useful, and I care about what the specific plan does." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I will soon become a sergeant!" Fernando, who was despised, said as Annord was angrily expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha." Annod smiled twice. "Young is good, but this action requires you to join. No one is more than you." Being able to maneuver thunderstorms, rest assured that the temptations will never make Alfonso see a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, just wait for you, then you won't participate. I've been afraid that you want to join." Anord smiled treacherously and then speeded up before Fernando's roar. "Okay, I Just kidding, the specific temptation plan can be made after investigating Alfonso's character, hobbies, style of work, and choice habits, but the core will not change, that is, the ruthless traitor to the referee by the 'Destroyer Tower' Informed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Internal hidden traitors? Do they know traitors?" Fernando asked in astonishment, and at the same time, his heart whispered, the old man was so old. I can still laugh like such a treacherous, really a natural old fox! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold smiled and shook his head: "Fernando, you are too young and too naive, although the major organizations dare not say that they have mastered all the hidden traitors, but at least Grab a part and put them in a position that will not cause too much damage, and now it is time for them to 'effective' for the organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He added: "Sometimes, traitors are more valuable to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has been smiling and faintly surprised, Mr. President seems to have no It is necessary to explain this in detail. Is he usually communicating with Fernando? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando thought about it, probably understood the meaning of Annold, and once again sighed, old fox! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, after Sharp's task of entrusting, the two of them have automatically joined the action, no need to sign up." Annod laughed. "Right, Douglas, I am very curious about your question. Are you interested in talking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very happy." Douglas did not hesitate to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three returned to the land of Thousand Lakes, while communicating the questions raised by Douglas, each expressing their own unverified views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the ruins of the lake, the body is out, Anord’s smile has disappeared, frowning, and his face is thinking: "Weird, you The concept is very strange, wrong, not right..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the self-talking, he did not forget to send the welcoming Roland to find a few vice presidents to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rigg, Ramon and Veronica came in. Anord has already returned to normal. He smiled and talked about the gatherings of major organizations. He said: "This action, we are responsible for the two most important aspects. If successful, we will be able to lead the other in the future. Cooperation, in which the second link is practical, I am responsible for Douglas, Fernando and Congers, Nielsen, Amanata and others cover and cooperate. This has been decided. No doubt."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first said the second link, and then looked at Rigg: "The first link is to lead to Ketonia, to rule out the possibility of him secretly following."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando suddenly realized that he had been worried about the introduction of Alfonso when he took the "heart of time". After all, no one can be sure that he is only interested in the union's magician. The old fox is really thoughtful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we only act alone. Two consecutive temptations will definitely be seen through conspiracy, so there must be other organizations to cooperate, the same, if twice tempted The interval is too short, and it will inevitably be seen. Rieg, I need you to go south tomorrow, and lead a circle of one week in Ketonia. You are the vice president and deserve his attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold looked at Rigg, his expression became very serious and dignified. "I know, this is very dangerous. If you are not careful, you will be killed by Ketonia. Only the nine rings* * Teacher, you can only be competent if you are good at escape and concealment. Moreover, you have to pay attention to the way you expose your whereabouts. You can't let Ketonia doubt that he thinks he has been chasing you, just like he used to hunt down other divisions. Like the high-ranking magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of this mission made Fernando a little scared, suspected that Rieg would refuse, but the gloomy and deep Rigg was calm and calm. Authentic: "No problem, this is my duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas didn’t know much about Rig, but didn’t think there was anything. Fernando’s eyes widened. This old guy usually fights for power and is rude, but at a critical moment, he is still very conscious. Very reliable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
