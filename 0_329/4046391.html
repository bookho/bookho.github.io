			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing sun hangs near the horizon, dyeing a layer of gorgeous flames, beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hot and dry Sphinx camp, Lucien had a feeling of cool breeze blowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart struggled to hesitate to turn around and did not speak. The sphinx who had commanded Lucien before came to wake up and angered and shouted: "This kind of person, The head has grown to the bottom of your XX. When you see the 'sacrificial squad', you can't move your eyes, can't think? Don't bathe the 'sun water'! Want to become an undead?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert is barren, the nobles of the Gusta Empire are not willing to expand to the south, so the natural enemies of the Sphinx have been a savage since the destruction of the ancient Mesquite Empire, and most of the words of the monks Related to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Water? When Lussien suddenly remembered his observation, this Sphinx, who was only known as Fair, always grinds in the small stone house directly in the midday sun, and then goes to the mausoleum with several other Sphinxes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucine thought that this was the place where Fair and the familiar Lions had gathered together, and when they were remembered by hypnosis, they forgot to ask relevant content, so After being scolded by a guy who looks like a sergeant, he rushed to the mausoleum with a self-considered attitude, but it was counterproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am wrong, I will go right away." Lucien left in fear, and relaxed in his heart, no longer entangled with "hinry" It is easier to get past the nine-level god priests, "the charm monster" or the "corruption control". Although it is impossible to monitor the entire camp and cannot detect tiny magical fluctuations, it is now the night when the mausoleum guards begin to change shifts. It is very likely that the "Sphin Chief" will report to the high-ranking priests of the Sphinx in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small stone house, there is a layer of liquid shining in the golden yellow color in the pool around the shape of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to the pool, a strong and ferocious female Sphinx picks up the strange liquid with a special gold spoon and guards the line of the Sphinx. "Let's go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing a savage and rude male surname of the Sphinx in front of this "girl" obediently posted, eyes and expressions clearly revealed love, Lucy Enne couldn't help but groan: "Is it a beautiful woman in the eyes of the male sphinx?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "only" is used to describe "beauty "It's a bit weird, but it's really the real thought in Lucian's heart. It's obviously a standing lion. It looks rough and covered with golden fluffy fluff. Even if it looks like human, it is not yet complete. A little beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The aesthetic gap is really big..." Lucien squatted in front of the Sphinx "Girl", letting her drench the golden liquid It is as warm as bathing in the winter, and there is no wet stain on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair, you are a little weird today." The female surnamed Saran looked at Lucan in front of him and whispered, "Have you lost your courage?" I didn't even dare to look at me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian was almost shocked again, and when he showed his acting skills, he hated others and said it was weird! Do you want to say that I am afraid of polluting my own eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I lost my courage." Lucien simply followed the self-feeling female Sphinx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sana boldly smiled and said: "I am curious what exactly makes Lu Wei's Fair lose courage? Even the impulse to chase a partner is gone." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to stage a retreat to ignore the classic opera that caused the "beauty" curiosity, but such a "beauty"... Lu Xien deep The land is helpless, but fortunately the great supporting role has lived up to expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the back of the team, a sphinx who is higher than Fair half-headed: "Fair, don't waste everyone's time, don't try to use weird The move caused Sana's attention! Hey, you still peeked at Sana last night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother, you really learn! Lucian pretended to be seen as a panic-like appearance, looking forward to Sana with fear and expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucienby defeated a high-ranking magician and left the small stone house exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Follow me into the mausoleum, don't disturb the sleep of the 'king'." A muscle knot, holding a long trench The tall Sphinx said harshly on the "grave guards" such as Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Following, Hurgus adults." "Tombs caretaker" answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien bowed his head, opened his mouth, made a speech, mixed in the many sphinxes, and at the same time figured out this The name of the captain of the "Tomb Caretaker". He seems to have the strength of a big knight, and there are five or six official knights in dozens of "grave guards", and the rest belong to high-ranking knights like "Fair." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't look at the relative amount of "Knight Level" here is exaggerated, because as a guardian of the mausoleum, gathered a lot of strong people around the Sphinx tribe - In addition to the hereditary guardians, the ability to be selected as a "grave guard" is the glory of the ordinary sphinx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Herges, Lucien looked at the huge stone around him, stepped on the yellow-brown ladder and entered the mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they entered, the hot and dry desert climate immediately became sullen and cold, as if they had come to the paradise of death from the world of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rectangular gray bricks on the ground and on the wall do not have any traces of corrosion. Under the inlaid gemstones, pearls, crystals, etc., there is a cold and dead taste. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mausoleum is a magnificent piece of any villa, manor or magic tower that Lucien has ever seen, whether it is a corridor or a room. People use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the influence of the Mishkate Empire, in the legend of the Sphinx, they are in charge of the mystery of life and death, that death is not the end, but the real The beginning of immortality. The Pyramid Mausoleum is a magical building that allows the mighty sphinx to lead the immortal paradise, so it is so magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the private legend, many of the Sphinx believe that their greatest king, who has fallen into the eternal sleep, will pass one day. The resurrection of the pyramids led the sphinx to become the world's lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pyramid that Lucien will sneak into is the mausoleum of the greatest Sphinx king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien with a javelin, followed Hurgus to inspect the mausoleum, and saw a lot of decaying bodies hanging in the hall, some All of them are human beings, some are other races, and they are caught and become a funeral life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously climbed several floors, the team "Tomb Guardian" quickly entered a hall engraved with countless strange symbols, mixed with murals smeared with lions A scene of majestic and mighty killing other races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black stone sarcophagus in the hall. When passing by them, Lucien is keenly aware of the evil cold power inside. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the funeral Sphinx?" Lucien continued to move in confusion, "The sphinx made by the mummies" the Underworld Guardian?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was sneak into the mausoleum, and feared that the "曰之冕" caused an accident, Lucien temporarily took it up, and the feeling of death power was not so exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving this a little weird hall, Hurgus continued to patrol with the "Tomb Guardian" and turned a lot of corridors to two huge Before the stone gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stone gate, while carving the sun, it depicts the silver moon, which symbolizes life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without a mental field, Lucien clearly felt the horrible death behind the stone door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the stone gate. After it, Rhine quietly arranged a strange magical array with the help of the mausoleum itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in front of Shimen, stood the "gatekeeper" of two big knights, each of them is much thicker than Fair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you sneak in? Lucien finally figured out the layout of the mausoleum, thinking fast and thinking, pondering the way - Rhein as a legendary vampire, after turning into a light breeze, entered Shimen without any difficulty, could not provide detailed arrangements and patrol lines of the mausoleum. Lucien can only get a part in Fair's memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sphinx is a high-level priest. It is easy to provoke the priests with direct hands. It can cooperate with the layout of the mausoleum to kill most of the legendary strongmen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in front of the high priest, Lucien couldn’t sneak into the “gatekeeper,” distorted as a disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We return." Hergges finished the ceremony with the high priest and led his "grave guards" team back, ending the first round of patrols. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to think of a good way. Lucien can only follow it and leave it at the end of the team. When he turns the corridor, he has a small black stone. Dropped down, gently landed without any sound, and sneaking into the darkness of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking through the corridors one by one, approaching the hall where the stone plaques were placed, Lucien found that the two "gatekeepers" dressed in the sphinx were from the opposite side. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to guard Shihmen?" Lu Xien moved in the heart, then bowed his head and continued to follow the "big forces" and passed the two "gatekeepers" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a few corridors and step into the weird hall, Hurgus whispered: "Here, take a rest, wait for another team of guards to patrol "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the "tomb guards" all stopped, and gathered together in threes and threes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall was sullen and sinister, as if it was actually in the body of Lucien, but was blocked by the "warm feeling". Helges seems to hate this sinister death, and walked a few more steps to stand up outside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Lucien quietly moved to the corner and then sneaked into the corridor leading to the stone gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Lucien just stepped into the hallway silently, and the voice of Herggus suddenly came! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s four feet in the air, appearing in the wind like Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be caught when you sneak, it’s definitely not a happy thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked up and said, "Fearing": "Herggs, I, my treasure, the gems fell in the corridor in front, I am afraid Being smashed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he also saw the hole in the hole for Hurgus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep eyes are full of pleading, and Herguz does not know why he is soft, whispered: "Sneak back and squat, don't alarm the high priest."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can a “grave caretaker” with no official knight level do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien "grateful to zero", repeatedly expressing his feelings with chaotically reversed sentences, then turned around and walked lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With psychological guidance and real-life events, the suggestion technique does not have to go all out, and the magic fluctuations become very small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lu Xien first stepped up and followed the two "gatekeepers" who had to hand in the handover, and then succumbed to the back. Until they arrived in a certain corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed is getting very fast, Lucien flustered and passed by the two janitors. Because he was too confused, he stunned a certain person. The door of the doorman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" The gatekeeper Aska’s voice was low and suppressed anger. The low-lying “grave caretaker” ran into nothing and said nothing. Want to leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, sorry, sorry." Lucien seemed to find out that he had made a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
