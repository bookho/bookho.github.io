			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Royal Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the door and saw the familiar elements of Morris, Gaston, Florenta and other high-level elements, in addition to outing exploration or magic research There are about 14 or five of the arcane masters who have progressed to the critical stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans Commissioner, inside is the top of the elemental will, your safety is no problem, I will stay outside." Bellak whispers in Lucien's ear One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently agreed to the jaw and walked in slowly, laughing and greeting the acquaintances of the magicians: "Good morning, Lord Morris, plus Mr. Stone, Ms. Florenza..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to our Evans committee, the youngest arc auditing committee member in the history of the Magic Council, also the youngest The winner of the Holm crown award will also get it and get it..." Morris graces up and humbly welcomes and introduces Lucien to the other elements of the high-level, can introduce to the back, suddenly feels his heart hurts Can't speak, "Well, I will also receive the Immortal Throne Award, the second person who will receive this award for our element, a very promising young man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The first element to receive the Immortal Throne Award is the Hatcher, who sums up the basic elements of the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a loss of wealth, the face is not good, the mood is not good Morris, the elements of the will of the high-level members have been very used to, and willing to be in this regard" Strike "He, at this time, he smiled and shook his head, secretly glaring at Morris's nickname - "silver-gray miser." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Florensa snickered and licked his face, feeling that the teacher was too shameful. She is the wife of the Arcanist. She is also a high-ranking magician who is very good at fighting. The wealth and resources are always lacking, so she looks very light, but based on the friendship between teachers and students, she always asks in Morris. When she has various suggestions, she will stand on his side more firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this is President Donald, the singer of the Supreme Council, just returning to the exploration of the alien space." Morris pointed to a The old man with white hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald seems to be a typical old gentleman of the Holm kingdom, wearing a meticulously dressed black top hat and cane, and the light blue eyes are neither turbid. Not sharp, it looks warm and harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is able to stand out among the many nine-ring Masters and become one of the six most-minded members of the highest jury. Lucien definitely does not dare to swear at him. A nine-level arcane master, a nine-ring magician, a Holm crown winner, etc., can form a dazzling aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Lord Donald. I have always been very curious about the alienation space, so I am extremely impressed by every magician who can explore different spaces. A tribute, can you tell me about the different space you explored this time?" Lucien politely said hello, and cleverly used curious to draw closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald’s laughter is low, as if his throat has been traumatized or inflicted with certain magic: “Evans, you are already a member of the Arcane Review Board, enough Eligibility to borrow most of the different space from the High Arcane and Magic Library of the Parliament. Of course, we all know that your recent purification sequence has soared, I am afraid I don't have time to read these books and documents."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa laughed, because the 53rd place in the purification sequence was "Element Chaos" Donald, and Lydia with the succubus line also smiled and turned to look To Lucien, the crimson eye reveals a faint interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Wayne to answer, Donald continued: “There are many different odd spaces, because we haven’t found a new alien space, we have no way to get it. Clearly formed reasons, this may involve the creation of the mysteries of the world. The oldest and most dangerous and widest space is the two places we call Hell and the Abyss, which are divided into layers like the Magic Tower."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the truth god teaches that the so-called Heaven Mountain is more mysterious, with most of the characteristics of the alien space, and various angels can be summoned as alien space creatures, Like the missing planet, we can't find it at all, and we can't explore it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ordinary heterogeneous space is much smaller than the main world, can find chaos Dark borders, creatures, ores, topography, etc. are relatively single, there is a fire-filled fire element space, a natural paradise with unicorns, a real planet floating but no dead, no gravitational and no bright star tomb, there are also Similar national structure . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp human world "<br <br /> & nbsp />;"We explore different spaces, one is to obtain a variety of precious resources and materials, and the other is to find the law and the reality of the world through the contrast between the imperfect heterogeneous space and the main world."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the Star Tomb this time, trying to figure out what they have to do with the active stars of the main world that are gravitational and radiant but unrecognizable, but unfortunately can't find any clues." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Donald mentions the tomb of the star, Lucien’s mind suddenly shows the vast, ridiculous, dead and lonely universe in the science fiction film. But there is no light and gravity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Donald probably satisfied Lucie’s curiosity, Morris introduced the other elements of the high-level will, and the meeting room door again Was pushed away, the gray hair of Lavindi came in, his black magic robe on dozens of element symbols arranged into a periodic table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The members at the headquarters are here, we start to discuss things." Morris saw Raven's sitting in a position away from himself and not facing each other, feeling It suddenly became very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is grateful to Lavin’s tiny jaw, the reason why he is late because of the care of the elemental willing division, guarantee Lucien is absolutely safe via a half-plane jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven did not care about Lucian’s gratitude. In his opinion, this is the duty that should be fulfilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first thing, about... Holm Crown Award." Morris licked his forehead and continued, "Larry's Ring' ionization 'Already made it, wait for the two pieces of Evans to be awarded together, or divide it into two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi directly expressed his opinion: "Issuing together, What is important is the honor and the ring, not the banquet and the ceremony. Don't waste everyone studying arcane and learning magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Mr. Lavendi speaks, Donald Florensa, Avery, Gaston, Locklint and others all nodded in agreement, there is no need to accept his roaring baptism in meaningless things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I very much agree with Lavendi's opinion, the most important thing is that the Holm Crown Award symbolizes the highest honor in the field of elements and alchemy, not a banquet, The ceremony and the ring are several levels and value. I think we should highlight this point. The ring is not good with a level of four or five... I am joking. Well, let's discuss the naming of the two rings of Evans. Morris, who received a lot of angry gaze "puncture", changed the subject without changing color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's very simple, one is electron or particle, the door, one is the origin." Florensa smiled and took the teacher's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien as a party can only remain silent, waiting for them to decide, in order not to stimulate Lord Morris and secret magic as a means of card, intend to wait The paper of the surname element will be submitted next year. It confirms that the electron is the internal structure of the atom, and the element can be changed. It theoretically shows the possibility of achieving one of the highest dreams of the alchemy system. The absolute value of a Hall crown award is now based on the rules of the miracle experiment. After being watched by Fernando, Chloe and others, they were sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemy system was originally the potion and item production department in the ancient magical empire, but later the magician of this department wanted to fundamentally change the substance, the ordinary Things are made into real gold - no constant magic, nor a product that can only sustain a period of time. The result has been a failure, never succeeded. Gradually, alchemy has become one of the top dreams, potions and articles. The system has also been simplified into an alchemy system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several women’s quarrels, Lucien’s two Holm crown rings were named “electronic” and “origin”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, I began to discuss the important issues of the will of the element. As a new member, Lucien kept silent, rarely spoke, and stood quietly with his hands crossed. , only give a choice when voting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a spectator, Lucien found that there was a factional struggle within the will of the elements of harmony and harmony. Morris and Donald were faint, each has Several close members, Gaston and other three high-level arcane divisions became a single faction, and Lavin did not care who, no matter which did not reason, he roared which one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After an hour, the meeting is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
