			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s half-face is very different from the “sleeping place” dominated by the dead soul, Fernando’s “Thunder Hell”, and Hathaway’s “Elemental Paradise”. When Lucien stepped in with Norman, the committee member of the Leading Committee, he did not have the feeling of entering the semi-position. It seems that this is part of the main material world. Everything works according to the same law. Mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the semi-levels of every legendary magician are different because of their own cognitive world, their preferences, and so on, but they are not accidentally It has a very special surname, like the half-face of Douglas, the distant green hills, the dense black forest and the mirror-clear clear lake, and the carpet around the magic tower. The main material world does not see a slight difference, just like one of the places with great scenery, there is nothing special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher's ideal is to understand the truth of the world, so the closer the semi-position is to the main material world, the better for him." The young and graceful Norman Laughed and explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly and looked around again at the marginal half-plane: "No wonder the Speaker named his half-face as '林斯奥德'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Linth Ode' is the meaning of "world truth" in the ancient language of the Ilvanas magical emperor, so Douglas's half-face is also known as the "real secret" and "the world in the mirror." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gates of the magic towers guarded by two Mithril Golems, Norman took Lucien into a small living room where one man was already sitting. Female two guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living room is covered with bright red carpets, with sofas, coffee tables and rows of bookshelves randomly placed, messy but quite comfortable, without strict rules, it seems It is Douglas's intimate place to be close to friends and juniors, not the ordinary banqueting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher, the storm dominates the Lord, the prophet is still doing the final test, we wait a little longer." Norman saw that there was only one man and one woman in the living room. The smile explained, then he introduced to Lucien: "These two are teachers' students, just did not go out, and there is no research that can't be put down for a while, so I specially came to witness the moment of this historical surname. If the teacher The artificial planet can fly around the world, can be observed by the astrological tower on the ground, and the teacher's celestial system will be strongly proved, no longer have to be questioned as it is now."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to this matter, Norman is a little excited and excited. Because of the teacher’s doubts over the past few hundred years, he feels wronged and almost forgot to continue his introduction. Fortunately, he returned to God in time and pointed The half-old man whose hair has been grayed out said: "This is Alti尓, the longest student who follows the teacher. He is good at astrology, force field, deformation and light and dark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Alti's face is thin Protruding cheekbones, narrow eyes, thin lips, wearing a chest arcanist eight, nine ring badge of the Grand Master, is not a member of any committee, nor the members of the Supreme Council group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently daggers, plain but slightly sharply said: "I am not the teacher who has been the teacher for the longest time, there is one older than me, follow the teacher The guy who has been learning for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this was said, Norman and the other woman were quite embarrassed, and I didn’t know how to respond. Lucien was suddenly realized. He should refer to the "master of control" and "the poetry of the goddess", Lord Brooke, who is rumored to be in a stranger with the Douglas Speaker because of the wave of particle disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Norman, who is not too old, who has never experienced this before, this is the record in the ancient books, in the poetry story. The legend, there is no personal feeling, it is difficult to produce extreme disgust and hate, and it is likely to follow Douglas with Douglas who has studied Douglas for a long time. This is a naked betrayal, a shameless act. It’s a shameful move, no wonder he has no respect for Brooke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien staying smiling, not asking because of Altty’s “deprivation”, Norman quickly pointed to another young woman: “This is Luciana, also a teacher's student, is good at elements, astrology, force field, summoning and deformation. He also has a deep research in the field of mathematics. You should have a lot of common language with Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just finished reading the journal Nature, I am very interested in the new geometry of you and Mr. Levski, and I am going to start further research, hoping to bring two new geometric systems. Gradually perfect and enriched." The special Luqiana hair of the pedigree is like a flame, setting off its own skin to be crystal and delicate. She is medium-sized, full of interracial style, and seems to be less than twenty-five years old. The seven-level Arcanist, Eight-ring Magician, and Arcane Review Committee badges on the chest strongly rebut the visual conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is completely indifferent to the new geometry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Norman on the side nodded slightly and seemed to agree with Arthur’s words, but he could not do it in the same way as Alti尓. It’s useless to criticize his new geometric system, criticizing Luqiana for not doing business and wasting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my hobby and the way to relax in my spare time." Luciana retorted coldly, she just liked to study things full of mathematical beauty. In fact, I don't think that these two new geometric systems can have any real arcane and magical value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that I don't need to introduce it? In recent years, the most famous genius of the parliament, Lucian Evans, in elemental, thermal and The field of mathematics has talents that no one else can match.” Norman quickly transferred the topic and introduced Lucien to two students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti尓 pointed to the sofa: "Evans, sit down, before the teacher comes down, we can discuss the problems of arcane and magic. I don't know much about the elemental field, but I know that your newly discovered electron is the cause of lightning. Hey, is the electromagnetic system based on waves?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is still normal when he does not discuss his contempt for disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the electromagnetic system always believes that current is an external manifestation of charge movement, but it has not been associated with microscopic particles before." Lucien is unbiased Answering, I took a sip of the lemon black tea that the servant sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, particles are the essence and foundation of the world!" Altty was somewhat fanatical. "As long as the teacher's artificial planet experiment succeeds, then Brooke can no longer question the teacher's celestial system. The reason why the planet can't be found is definitely because of other reasons! In this way, the teacher's experiment on the speed of light will strongly prove that the ether medium does not exist, and there is no medium, light. The fluctuations are like the high-rises that have been dug up the foundations, and can no longer rule the brains of the parliamentary arcaneists. They can only collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light and Spirit is a particle, and it must be a particle!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norman frowned and interrupted Alti尓’s fantasies with disapproval: “Don’t say it first” The teacher's experiment has not been successful. Even if it succeeds, it can only prove strongly, not completely, and perhaps there are other theories containing ether to explain the experiment, and the diffraction phenomenon of light, the bright spot in the shadow of Brooke. Then the particle theory is temporarily unable to solve We can't be too optimistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Norman, okay, I can see it, you actually support the theory of volatility, right?" Titan was furious. "Why isn't the diffraction phenomenon of light just a strong proof, not a complete proof, maybe there are other explanations containing particle theory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accused Norman was somewhat annoyed: "Isn't the various theoretical explanations put forward in these decades been falsified? Alti, open your eyes and look at the blinded eyes, see how much inside the parliament The Arcane Master supports particle theory and wants to overturn the wave theory. Let's use particle theory to explain the diffraction phenomenon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hate? I hate?" Alti anger I pointed at myself incredulously. "I will hate Brooke's bastard? I just believe in my own judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rucciana also joined the battle group:" Unfortunately, let Norman look down on me. I am the Arcanist who rarely and rarely supports Particle Theory. A doctrine that cannot be confirmed even on its own foundation, hey, there are many people who don’t believe it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, when many theories were overthrown in the past, The truth is in the hands of a few people, but the particle theory can't explain the experimental phenomena. Why do the archaeologists believe?" Norman unconsciously showed his true inclination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a traitor!" Alti's narrow eyes were so great because of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just insisting on the truth!" Norman responded unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Douglas students were caught in a fierce quarrel because of wave theory and particle theory, leaving Lucien aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wiped his forehead with a little cold sweat, a little worried that they would fight, spread to themselves, and waited to see Alti尓, Norman blushing neck thick, In the heart, "It is a dangerous thing to argue that the volatility and particle theory in the Magic Council..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
