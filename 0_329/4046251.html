			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Cup Tavern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sat down with a wooden chair and smiled calmly and said: "Hello, this time the task is bothering you, don't know What do you call it?" Lucien deliberately stretched out the right hand of the "Element" of the Holm crown ring from the pocket, in order to let the two magicians on the opposite side see, identify their identity, and get the command of the mission team. right. This will reduce the possibility of facing danger, so it is the style of the leader or the superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fighting Mage Charlotte, Intermediate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intermediate Magician Sander Pull."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte and Sandra maintain a respectful attitude and briefly introduce themselves, although they are confident in their own magical strength, but Did Lucien join forces with Felipe to kill a high-ranking magician? Evans, they are still soberly aware of the gap between the two sides, not mentioning the unique magic or magic items hidden by Lucien, but the "Holm Crown" ring worn on his right middle finger can also be defeated without suspense. And destroy both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, according to the habit of the Magic Council, if the two magicians meet each other when the magic level is not much different, belonging to the same level, then priority is given to The level of skill to determine the status, and as the winner of the Holm Crown Award, the element of the highest honor in the field of magic, Lucian? Evans, as a four-level arcane master, has enough prestige and qualification to be respected by most mid-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sides were suppressed by Lucien, and Charlotte and Sandra naturally regarded him as the leader of the mission, but only experienced in combat. The two still have some thoughts in mind. If in the specific action, Lucien does not show enough leadership ability to match his prestige and strength, then simply use him as an important combat force, and will not blindly follow and follow. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the pub environment is complicated, there is no need to reveal their magic level and good factions here, Lucian turned to look at the two because of surprise and temporarily forgot the fear Magic Apprentice: "I am Lucien Evans, I need a guide, which of you follow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the two magic apprentices answered, Lucien smiled and said to Charlotte and Sandra: "In detail, when you go to the castle, you will tell me that things can't be delayed for too long, or else the devils who are summoned through the bondage will come over. The more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucian, this kind of pragmatic style that does not entangle Susan and Scott again, Sandra and War Mage Summer Lott nodded lightly and expressed appreciation, which is in line with their standards of conduct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after hearing the words of Lucien, the two magic apprentices recalled the scene of hell in the castle, the blood, viscera, and meat on the ground. And the burning flames seem to be still biting their hearts and nerves, that is a nightmare that is no longer willing to meet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Mr. Evans, I, I will tell you the details inside the castle, just don't need a guide?" Susan's face with a sly face replied up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timid and thin Scott is even scared to say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head, not eager to say: "You should know that no magic can read your memory completely before the 9th Ring. You can only choose the surname to conduct thought investigation, hypnosis, lie identification, etc., so it is easy to miss the information of some important terrain in the castle, and delay time. So I need a guide, you can always ask questions when you encounter problems. Rest assured, we have enough strength to protect an apprentice.” When speaking, Lucien used some hypnotism techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle and calm tone slowly calmed the emotions of the two magic apprentices. Susan suddenly remembered the respect of the two middle-level magicians to Lucien: "Is he a high-ranking magician? If not, I am afraid that there are five rings in strength! The danger of going to the castle together will be much smaller, and it will leave a good impression on him. Maybe I will have an apprentice without a teacher in the parliament in the future. When you have a hard life, such a good impression will help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not expect to be accepted as an apprentice by a high-order or near-high-level magician. In particular, she has officially followed Bertrand to start studying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With courage, Susan swayed the burgundy hair: "Mr. Evans, I am willing to guide you, but I have low strength, hope, I hope you can give some attention to protect me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language is not smooth enough, but she still tried to express her own meaning, and she quietly glanced at the side and there was a little trembling, not afraid to act as a guide to Scott, in my heart Passing a glimpse of joy: "Even if you are outstanding in spirit, the talent of arcane is very good, and the most important thing in the heart of Bertrand's teacher, but the timid atrophy is your Achilles heel, without the care of the teacher, maybe later you It’s better than me...” The shackles and envy of Scott’s possession have been hidden in her heart for more than a year, and the contrast between the two sides gave her the feeling of getting rid of this “shadow”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Very good, your guts make me appreciate it. This is a must-have for a successful magician. It’s not a peaceful, no danger, Magicians who don't know how to fight are hard to survive. Even if they concentrate on arcane research, many unknown explorations also need to take certain risks and need enough courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien’s right hand bounced the left neckline, then stood up and took the pocket watch out of the lined pocket to open: “It’s five o'clock in the afternoon, ending the mission before dark, if it’s not finished yet, we’ll Exit the castle as appropriate, blockade nearby, because some devils and nightmares will be terrible at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte and Sandra followed up, In a short and powerful answer: "Okay, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien and others left, the adventurers became as active as they breathed. Some exchanges excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the young magician just the legendary high-order? Otherwise, how can the attitude of the two middle-level magicians be so respectful!" The beard dwarf wiped his rough hairy face. "But is he too young?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of adventurers have never seen the existence of high-levels because They are either big nobility, or are supported by the royal family, or live in a place like the Sky City, or venture in the dark mountains of horror and in all kinds of different spaces, with little intersection with low-level adventurers, even in Rantart. When the street meets, the adventurers can't recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knife screamed and returned to normal state: "Don't look at him young, maybe a few hundred years old, than your grandmother's grandmother's grandmother Grandma is still old..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When facing the biting cold wind, Lucien goes with Charlotte and Sandra to Bertrand "The castle flies, and the forest below is covered with a thick layer of white snow, with a bit of evergreen green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the way things go through and the general terrain inside the castle is like this." Sandra, who took Susan’s flight with "winding", relayed the information just now. Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the talk, see Susan trembled coldly, Sandra blessed her with a "bearing elemental damage" - this is ancient magic, although in There is no effect on the damage of the elemental magic, but it is a good choice in the environment of the imbalance of elements. In the cognition of the ancient magical empire, high temperature and cold are elemental imbalances, so it can endure like the current thermal system. The cold and the "tolerate hot" magic allow the subject to maintain a spring-like feeling in a cold environment of minus ten degrees Celsius and a high temperature of sixty or seventy degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed his monocles: "Susan and Scott fled in a hurry and only noticed several low-level devils. We can't care. I am a three-ring magician, good at elements and astrology, some good magic items, what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a four-ring battle mage, Mastering the magic of the four factions of the element, the force field, the heat and the change, there are magic items that match their own strength.” Charlotte’s eyes focused on the castle built in front of the mountain, which gradually grew larger as the distance approached. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra's gaze also shifted over the past, succinctly replied: "four rings, electromagnetic, light dark, force field and summon."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, wait, if you need to deal with the summoning magic array in the bondage, you will be handed over to you." Lucien black double-breasted long dress quickly burned a layer The golden flame, and soon formed a shield around the body in vitro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sees the arrival of the "Bertrand" castle, did not carelessly use the Holm crown ring "element", inspired it with The five-ring magic "Strong Flame Shield", which lasts for ten minutes before being broken...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
