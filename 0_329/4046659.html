Fernando reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the protection of the shield of truth, plus the third-order legendary item itself, the "heart of time" is not a long-sword It was destroyed in the last explosion, but the cracks were slightly deepened, and there was still a feeling that time could not be chased. Natasha glanced at him and smiled at Lucien. "I have a sword of truth. The heart of time is not useful. You take it." Exchange something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without swapping, it can be used to improve the 'monthly timepiece'." Hathaway said flatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he still changed his status as an epic knight, Lucien picked up the sword directly, examined it carefully, and nodded: "When I deepen my ability in time and space, I have the confidence that I can use it to raise the monthly time to the second level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and space materials have always been scarce With the "heart of time", Lucien will not have to worry about how to upgrade the exclusive legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked around: "First go back to Allinge, the guests are still waiting for the protagonist of the wedding, the things of the dead world, and so on tomorrow." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard the words and looked at Natasha: "Do you not deal with wedding dresses and wounds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha took Ketonia’s storage bag and 曰记, and held the badge that was constantly dripping with blood. He laughed and said: “No, blood and wounds are the best wedding accessories for the knight. Such a wedding dress can never be passed through!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the depths of the world, the vast black palace that is as broad as the kingdom stands there, and the highest spire rises into the air and does not see the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the court, the black walls and floors that are faintly insane, set off everything to be cold and cold, along a straight avenue, through the palaces. There is a corridor, a garden that is not angry, and you can reach the largest building, and its center is filled with a gray curtain with no margins and no upper end. It is inlaid with countless souls, giving people an unusual The feeling of horror and shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different faces in the "soul fireplace", some twisted, some sly, some serene, some quiet, but everything is static Quiet, no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, there are strange footsteps behind the gray curtain, breaking the solidified silence, and the connection in the empty hall is constantly echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of illusory ghosts is taking a heavy step, as if with weight and flesh, dragging forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the soul fireplace from behind, the ghost suddenly raised his head, revealing a white face with no color, just like the "flame of the source" Benham ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have a fateful remnant of his fate in his eyes, so that the illusory and transparent soul will continue to scream, and it seems to collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of the flame of the right hand stretched out, pressed on the "soul fireplace", and gradually became contained, the soul is a lot more, then, he looked inside The dense soul, gnashing his teeth: "Douglas! Hathaway! Lucien! Natasha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every name is an accent, expression Abnormal 狰狞:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My legendary item!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn topic!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long time, he turned and walked hard to the depths of the other side of the main hall. The pace was still slow and his feet were still strange on the ground. The sound of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden behind the Allinge Tower, countless kinds of flowers are held in seasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blossoming tulip-like flower shakes its body, spits out the pleasant notes from the flower, as if it were the best singer, and the tall trees next to it Waving the branches, slamming his trunk, making a sound like a timpani, and the rest of the baby's face thorns with a flute, taking the stems of their own stems, pulling the violin's green vines with branches...the magic garden The Aboriginal people presented cheerful music to the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s too dreamy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply unimaginable!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this a magical plant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the garden is a broad green lawn with a The red carpet, with a table and chairs, and a nobleman who came to the wedding, couldn’t help but be stunned. The noble ladies who pursued romance were even more brilliant. They all saw magic plants. It’s a horrible horror, and it’s unheard of in such a state of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the rare low-level magicians who came here are shocked, they can form a "plant symphony orchestra"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to feel their surprise and affection, the magic plants are more forceful, let the joyful melody sway to every corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, magic is great!" Ai Wen said excitedly. He wore a black dress and entered the magic school last year, but because of the foundation Too weak, the progress of learning has not kept up, and there has been frustration, but now, this mood has dissipated, anyway, I have already passed the inspection, and have the spiritual talent! Learning slowly will always grow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, and John are also experiencing this kind of thing for the first time. The rumored and fascinating magical plants are so pleasing in the sun, contemporary arcanes and The ancient magician really is very different! The last bit of mustard and shadow of the magician in their hearts slowly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How has this music never been heard?" Louise stood with a few noble ladies who loved music, listening to the joyful and lively melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Haisong (due to his previous merits, his hereditary title has been promoted by Natasha), Julie, the granddaughter of her reverence, is still aspirational: "Lord Evans is One of the greatest musicians, Her Majesty also has excellent musical talents. They must have created their own weddings. Well, it feels great. It’s better than all the wedding music in the past. When I get married, I have to Playing this work!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls discussed the music slyly, but Winston, James, Waulite and others were surrounded, anxiously waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devouring of the dead world, there should be legendary hands..." Winston's face was gloomy, and he was upset that he could not respond in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His judgment made the face of Grand Duke of Vaolirit a little worse, his lips trembled and he couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James comforted the Grand Duke: "With the Lord of the Elements, Lord Her Majesty and Lord Evans will not have anything to do."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party seems to count the Hathaway mother-in-law." The old Grand Duke of Vaolirit still called Hathaway as a mother-in-law, and her expression was very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suspect that Ketonia is involved," Winston whispered, his instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James took a soft breath: "It’s a disaster, but the legendary third-order epic knight is very difficult to kill, do you really have to wait until he is old? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the relaxed and joyful music, the strong oppression enveloped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, two figures in the sky fell, giving off a faint bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams came one after another, because Natasha’s holy white wedding dress was stained with blood, very awkward, and the blood with silvery purple belly was still dripping slowly, falling on the red carpet, and the pieces were more vivid and more enchanting. The deep red, at the same time, she seems to hold something in the hands, is also dripping blood, but there is no silver or purple, but slightly swaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of holding Natasha and matching her, Lucien’s black tuxedo also has a piece of glittering silver-colored blood spots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were attacked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After being so hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician and the nobility are whispering in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vaoliette Grand Duke, Winston, James and others have quietly sighed and returned, even if they are injured, they are better than fallen! Moreover, they also noticed that Hathaway, Douglas, and Fernando appeared on the other side. It seems that no one died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha smiled at her father, nodded, and then struggled hard, and along with Lucien, firmly walked to the end of the red carpet, where There is a vaulted building in the magical tradition that symbolizes the gates of marriage, reflecting the faint silver ash in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the serious injury has not recovered, Natasha will tear a slow healing wound a little bit every time he takes a step, dripping more blood, this severe pain Let her have to bite her lips, a silvery red rose, like a strange lip gloss, and Lucien just took her left hand, did not help her, respect her wishes - walk this article Symbolic red carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of blood with a hint of silvery purple dripping slowly, blooming on the red carpet, Natasha's back has always been straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody of passion and joy suddenly changed, becoming solemn and beautiful, with the sacredness of marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene made the guests slightly shocked, the scene was quiet, watching the two slowly walked to the end of the red carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned sharply and raised her right hand to reveal a blood-stained badge, treble:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I once made a promise to kill Ketonia personally, for revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, I received The best wedding gift, with the cooperation of my husband, I personally killed him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a deafening voice, the badge is still in a drop Dropping the blood, and this blood is like dropping in everyone's heart, making people become jealous:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? A nine-ring Master and A golden knight killed the heart of time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the 'mythic' character, the existence of the legendary third-order!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the unbelievable eyes condensed in the hands of Natasha, many people recognized that it is really a unique badge of Ketonia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the aid of several legendary peaks of the Magic Council? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winston looked at the nearby Hathaway in surprise, was she killed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien did not say anything, a wave of his left hand, a sparkling sword slanted to the sky, at the same time, The surrounding environment changes, and the darkness of the stars emerges, but each planet is exceptionally special. It is entangled in two different colors, like different elements, surrounded by an infinite number of unreal satellites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very small, it’s great, it’s one, it’s 10,000, “Atomic Universe”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Time Heart's Long Sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herald Evans has been promoted to the legend ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
