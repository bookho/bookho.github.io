			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Douglas nodded gratifiedly. "Who else wants to join the first adventure plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Involving the mystery of the soul, I have to go and see it anyway." The master of alchemy, Klaus, smiles, among the two crowns in the field of creation, the mystery of material changes has been uncovered by Lucien The veil of the surface, but the secret of the soul is still hidden in the thick black mist. As a legendary magician who is determined to directly create intelligent life, he has long been eager for the soul fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him and Lucien taking the lead, the soul of the dead dominated Vicente also whispered: "The soul field is my constant pursuit, I hope first Time to see the soul fireplace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Vicente want to join, Fernando snorted and voiced loudly: "You deliberately deleted Adolf about the horse. The memory of Skilling, Viken and others concealed the secret of immortality. How do you let me give you the peace of mind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been hot The temper, to be honest, is never afraid of offending anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead dominates Cold Road: "Your good student has not been concealed for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He should know the secrets of immortality in the deepest part of the dead spirits earlier than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was only a mid-level magician at the time, and when you knew the secret, it was a big arcian, legendary third-order, how do you compare with him? Why don’t you go? And the magic apprentice than the speed of casting?" Fernando whispered, the surrounding pressure dropped sharply, the clouds were dense, and there was a faint thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head and smiled. Fernando has always been short-sighted. His students can only growl and others can't: "Okay, Vicente, because you are in Adao." I have done a lot of problems with memory processing. This adventure plan requires you to make a magical vow to join, and take out the legendary magic or ritual of equal value as a fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The complete memory of Ador is also handed over." Fernando did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente took a deep breath and the dark red flame beat a few times: "Good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Originally hiding this secret has nothing to do with the overall situation, and no one will guess this point, so that you can gain more when you explore the world of the dead spirit in the future. Who knows that Lucien even knows it! I even talked directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not know the meaning of the immortal secret representative? That represents the highest achievement in the realm of the soul and the material, and can be completely at the level of any wish! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to participate, at some point, change and illusion magic can make everyone circumvent the danger." "Transformation Master" Erica said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers: "Everyone can take the initiative, I am very satisfied, but there are still a lot of preparations that need to be done in the early stage. We are starting for two months. Sean, I have some deeper gains in the field of time and space, and we work together to upgrade your monthly timepiece to the second-class legendary items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you, Lord of the Speaker." Lucien did not refuse, relying on himself, I am afraid that after three or four years, I will hope to upgrade the monthly time, and more than one strength will guarantee one, for myself, and for the newly formed small Family, at this time, there is no need to conceal the legendary occupation of "Time and Space Observer" from the Speaker of the Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone who participated in the first adventure plan will go back and prepare." Douglas announced the end of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A door to the alien in the Allinge Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light shining, the black robe mage Nika came out from the inside, and his messy hair was neatly compared to more than two years ago. No longer like a weirdo or a madman, the little boy Axi followed him, curiously looking at the empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to Allinge, I am a member of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors. Tang Pei stood in the opposite side of the door and smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magician is said to be talented and mentally competent. After less than two years of basic study, there is a five-ring magician's standard, and it is said to be Guided by Lucien. Come, so his committee will come and meet.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a month of hard trek, he arrived in the oasis. Later, he spent nearly half a year crossing the ocean and came to the magical parliament's branch. Because of his outstanding mental strength, he was a high-ranking man in the magic tower at that time. The magician fancy, dedicated him to stay, spend energy to teach him the foundation, until the arcane has a certain level, then let him come to Allinge "training." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The City of the Sky has to feel from the outside." The soup pointed to the door. "I will take you to the Wizards Management Department."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know the great Arcanist Lucien? Is Evans absent?" Nika asked expectantly, he already knew that the exact name of the great sage was big arcane. division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum shook his head: "The atomic control" is in Aringe, but he is very busy recently, no time to see outsiders, and later have a chance to see "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a pity." Nika was quite disappointed. She mainly wanted to express gratitude to Lord Evans for guiding her. I saw the dawn in a thick darkness. "Mr. Tang, I don't know when I can enter the Holt School of Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup is awkward Lips: "Only you can enter the college through the Unified Entrance Examination of Higher Magic Schools. That is to say, you have to wait for the exam that begins in June next year. For more than a year, you better find some other tasks, but There are so many books of arcane and magic here that you won't be able to learn anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there is no free time, suitable for arcane The task of research and magic analysis?" Although Nika has a teacher, he still uses his family name to rely on himself. We intend to use the task to earn a living and research expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum laughs and laughs: "The council will subsidize some of your arcane points according to your magic level and arcane level. As for the task, go to the teacher. Now there are more schools, teachers are short, and they are relatively free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Nika looked at Aki and felt that the teacher was really relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soup, Nika and Aki took the magic lift and went to the first floor of the Wizards Management Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tang, every layer has a purpose?" Axi asked curiously, he was used to the lift in the magical parliamentary branch. I don’t want to scream like the first ride, but I feel embarrassed and can only bite my lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipe points to the opposite layer: “It’s just one of the floors of the panel...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This layer has Mr. Gaston's 'Biomass Synthesis Lab'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, Life Matter Synthesis Laboratory? "The little boy Aki is very excited to sigh, this name is high-end atmosphere, Nika also looked at it with great curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Gaston has a breakthrough in the field of living matter, and proposed the concept of elemental structure, thinking that the surname of a substance is not only related to the atomic name, The number of atoms is related to their structure." Soup spectrum is very beneficial in this respect, and it is emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Structural..." Nica has just made up for the basics of the concept of the most cutting-edge areas is still in a state of utter disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum points to the opposite side: "This layer has a well-known atomic research institute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Atomic Research Institute?" Even in the Alien Division, Nika also learned about the atomic institute founded by Lord Evans through the words of the magicians and the past journals. It is like magic. The front of the steam train dragged the entire magic parliament forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own affection for Lucien, Nika’s expression at this time is full of reverence and yearning, with faint excitement, and Aki is running to the side. On the top, through the mask, excitedly looked at this layer with admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, there are hormonal and psychological laboratories in this layer." The soup spectrum was slightly mentioned, and the next layer was introduced. The 'Genetic Laboratory' was established by the author of the cell field, Mr. Felipe, and several Necromancers. They are said to have received huge sponsorship from the nobility, but there is no result yet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
