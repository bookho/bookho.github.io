			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevaser, the third layer of hell, the name of the magical division of the main material world is "burning the city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this layer of seemingly no margin, there is no plain, no mountains, no rivers, no hills, no wasteland, only magnificent cities made of steel, but underground The flames are burning all the time, even if the steel is burnt, and more steel buildings are in a red hot state, so that every close pale ghost is sizzling and smoky, It seems as if "evaporation disappears" at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smog of smoke hangs over the sky, all kinds of devils walk in the steel giants, they are orderly, but treat each one cruelly Enter the soul of hell, the demon of captives, etc. The rumors are burning the underground of the city, in the endless flames, there is a huge prison, holding different intelligent creatures, and the most direct evidence is When walking on the hot ground, you can often hear the screams and screams of unknown sources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of devils pressed a group of pale and fuzzy souls to the tower of the center of the "burning city", waving a special whip from time to time, these The souls that go into hell draw pain and mourning, and the more painful they are, the more excited the little devils are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that all kinds of post-mortem customs will prevail. It’s no wonder that the spread of truth gods will be so fast..." A huge caravan has not changed its appearance and wears Dressed up, Lucien sighed with interest and pity, this is his first time into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the past research of the Magic Council, after death, if there is no special technique, the soul is dead on the spot, but in the river of the Hell and the Abyss In the middle, there will be souls floating out, but without the memory and appearance of the past, it is impossible to tell who is who, and in the hell and the abyss, these souls are either degraded into demons, demons, or made to cast special magic or extraordinary The "soul gem" of ability - this is the hard currency of hell, or it gradually collapses and disappears completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the essence of the soul, how it is produced, and where it comes from, it is the current problem of arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after discovering the realm of the dead, the arcaneists have reason to believe that one of the "destinations" of the soul is also the realm of the dead, if the custom of death A corresponding space can be formed in the "world of the door", and some souls with strong desires and wills can enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of a feeling of injury to a class, Lucian’s mind emerged with an idea that after the parliament overthrew the Truth in the main material world, While exploring the vast stars and other spaces, it is necessary to bring the hell into control. Of course, with the current strength of the parliament and the enemies facing it, this goal has not been realized for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Including Hell into the rule of parliament, this is something that the ancient magical empire couldn’t even think about..." Lucien walked vainly on his feet. On the street, all the stones laid underneath are red hot. When you hit an egg, you will zoom in. Zizez will zoom in. In addition to the devil born in the flame, even the knight can not bear this high temperature and burning for a long time, so those souls Captives will be so painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caravan where Lucien is located is the "outside trade group" organized by the Magic Council. It is the "business conduct" that Guangming Zhengda came to. After all, the devil is not a product. Highly clean, do not need food, resources and all kinds of enjoyment of "Saints", they also need resources not necessary for hell to forge weapons, enhance their strength, also need to maintain their own luxury enjoyment of life, so they will entrust a few devils to follow They help them collect resources in the main material world and then conduct relatively fair transactions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this kind of thing, obviously can not circumvent the magician who is good at collecting and alchemy. Similarly, the magic council also needs special materials produced by hell, and will This kind of transaction control helps to limit the strength of the devils in their own hands, so that a few greedy guys can provide strategic resources unrestrained for the wealth, strength and soul of the post-mortem soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, because of this kind of trading behavior, the past magicians have added more evil colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dark red devils greeted each other from the other street, kicked a human soul, and then respectfully followed the leader of the "transaction group" We said: "Mr. Dear Sorcerer, the Duke is waiting for your goods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitt, the leader of the "transaction group" nodded in nostalgia, then turned around and smiled at Lucien: "Hello, are you going to the 'Steel Tower'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high-ranking magician, how could he not know the famous "atomic master", "three-view destroyer", and the great arcian Lu Xien? Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up and looking at the red tower in the middle of the burning city, Lu Xien smiled and said: "I will not go, the steel duke may not want to see Come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the "Steel Tower", the iron-black steel duke face looked solemnly below, a legendary peak, one caused a lot The legendary peak of the legendary fall is really not a good "guest", especially for the legendary second-order, relying on the "burning city" to reluctantly confront the legendary third-order opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If anything, you can contact Colin of the 'Soul Balance'." Hitt didn't say much, rushing to ask an archer. The whereabouts are not wise things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Soul Balance" is the "Alchemy Hut" of the Magic Council in the Burning City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently decapitated, and soon incorporated into the steel giant city to come to the devil and a small number of "businessmen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'The Lord of Hell' should already know that I am coming to hell, will He obstruct me?" Lucien is very clear that hell is equivalent to "Hell" The avatar of the Lord in a certain sense, no matter how you hide the traces and sneak into the hell, it is very difficult to get past Maldives, so it is better to come in with the light and bright, "Next go to the eighth floor of 'silent hell', see Can you not find the special star nucleus, indirectly test the attitude of Mardi Moss, and then enter the ancient ruins of the ninth floor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The idea just came out, Lucien suddenly felt a bit, and looked back to the other side of the street, seeing a boy with a smile on his face holding a pack of materials to the edge of the "burning city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only the living magicians and a few devil believers here, so this boy is undoubtedly a soul, from his floating state, translucent The body can see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the soul in hell is either as demented or full of resentment and viciousness, unable to maintain normal mental state, but this young soul The sun is shining, giving Lucien a feeling that he is still "live". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also 'smelled' the taste of 'silent hell', where did he come from the 'burning city' trade?" Lucien guessed speculatively . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "burning city" is the "outside window" of Hell "trade". Other layers of hell only carry out some secret transactions for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this weird young soul coming from "Silent Hell", Lucerne of the Arcane Master's curiosity followed him and planned to see Where is he going? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grandpa, Grandpa, the stone of the evil spirits you want, the 'Elf Leaf' and the 'Joy Flame Volcano Steel' were bought." It is a very remote place to burn the city, and even the devil is rarely here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fire-wrapped steel building, a faceless old man stood with a cane, with a bottle of devils in front of him. The “flame wine” that seems to be a pub owner came to “burn the city” and “purchase” the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human? Lucien is slightly stunned, and human beings living in hell are not shredded and eaten by the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is ready to start a mental field and see if there is magic cover in the old man, he suddenly raises his head: "Maman, you brought When the guests come, why don't you say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Juvenile" Maman suddenly turned back and saw Lucine, who did not hide his whereabouts: "I, I don't Know him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, but I just want to meet your grandfather, so I am coming over with you." Lucien said freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
