			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafati, Gossett and other strong people with the vigils quietly returned to Aalto, the city in the dark is still quiet, no difference when they leave . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Cardinal Vera? Amorton suddenly stopped in the air and turned to the commander: "El Salvador, the night watchman with your team went to the Melzer Black Forest to help Ms. Camille search for the Princess." She is the giant of the Vaolirit referee. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Salvador has not answered yet, the deputy head of the Violet Knights, Count Hayward, was surprised and worried: "What happened to His Royal Highness?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amorton's sleek, beautiful face without any emotional authenticity: "It is said that Verdi colluded with the magical parliament to assassinate the princess, and now the princess is breaking into the black In the forest, Ms. Camille is looking for her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafatti and Hayward also questioned: “Is the information accurate? Is it really Verdi’s rebellion? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are as surprised as the nobles who went to Lake Elsinore, but they are not surprised that Verdi’s assassination Tasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was Cardinal Sart's just told me." Amorton just said the source of intelligence, so Haihuade and others no longer doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Hayward sullenly said: "I also go to help find the Princess of the Princess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he is blond, handsome and tall, masculine, like a young man in his twenties, but actually has more than one hundred and sixty years old, has experienced countless battles and conspiracy, now he smells A bad "taste", it seems that it is not coincidental that I waited for someone to go to Lake Elsinore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer El Salvador replied: "The will of the bishop is your will, and I will lead the team immediately. Only the truth will last forever."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is forever." Amorton crossed the cross on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the Black Forest of Melzer, relying on Aaron’s special bloodline ability, Todd and the two did not take long to see the piece of devastated Ghost Aloe Vera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They use Ghosts Aloe to stop bleeding and eliminate odors." Todd is also trained as a orthodox knight. "Aaron, you can tell where they escaped." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron checked the traces left in the shadows nearby, and the trimmed moustache moved: "The Baron, the shadow tells me that they Did not leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't leave..." Todd first watched with a long sword vigilantly, then woke up: "They left by the river! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts and aloes are all near the water source, so there is a small and small river, squatting toward the Marshall River. According to Todd's speculation, the two people who were tracked by them were lying directly in the river and drifting in the water: "They are very capable of getting rid of tracking and occupying the advantage of the Black Forest terrain. The result is that we are getting closer and closer. This is likely to They are suspicious and suspect that we have a unique tracking method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron looks serious: "After entering the water, I can't communicate with the shadows." Not a big knight, can't use underwater shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd did not panic, but smiled: "The speed of the water and the speed of the knights are very different. If they drift, we will catch up very quickly. And if they go ashore, they will definitely leave traces of water stains. We will track them on both sides of the river and don't miss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it would be a waste of time "Aaron knows that it is very troublesome to carefully search for the traces of the enemy's landing. You and Todd are not magicians. There is no magical magic. You can only rely on this stupid way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd gently jumped across the opposite side: "Don't worry, we are very lightly injured, faster than they are, the advantage is on our side, delaying a little time It’s nothing.” He’s almost half of his nose and mouth have been restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Melzer Black Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha quickly left after drifting in the river for a short time and continued to fly deep into the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you look so embarrassed." Natasha snorted and laughed on Lucian’s back, her knight suit was broken. But after all, it was made of high-grade materials, and there was no such thing as the soreness of the clothes like Lucien. Only the purple long hair [***] was put on, which made Lucien’s neck a little itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the black robes still in the drowning water, using a strange shrub like a hay to handle the dripping water stains, some worried Authentic: "I don't think this can completely get rid of the enemies behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are a few special magics in the magic that can help dry clothes and process traces. However, Lucien had concentrated on analyzing "Starlight Shield", "Magic Missile", etc., and had no time to learn the magic. It is too late to learn temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They should have a unique tracking method, we are afraid we can't get rid of it completely. Now we need to delay the time and give me time to recover." Natasha is very I am awake without a blindly optimistic answer: "I know all the knights around Verdi, and I know their blood power. Unless there is magical help, they can never do this, so it is likely that he secretly recruited. Those dark knights, maybe waiting for me to recover a bit, we can do a counterattack and kill the dark knight who has the tracking strength!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Can't be sure how to track our knight's strength later? If it's Todd? If it's a magical item?" Lucien calmly analyzed and corrected Natasha's habitual attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked a purple eyebrow: "But don't you think they are getting closer? Don't want to do something, don't wait for them." Catch up?” The more in-depth judgments do not require strong intuition, just by not getting rid of the trail and the temporary strength of the two sides can be drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need to be more confident." Lucien looked at the stars and the surrounding environment that the sky is about to disappear, probably determining where it is. So I adjusted my direction. "At least you have to wait for the strength of the ordinary knight.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not pay attention to the small changes of Lucien, and concentrated on checking After his own physical condition: "The most serious phase of blood stasis has passed, but I am very injured, and I may have to wait until the sun rises to restore the strength of the Cavaliers. By the way, Lucien, are you getting any medicines or materials in addition to magic items in the ruins? "She began to identify every possibility, and Lucien went to the ruins to find medicines that would enhance the strength of her knights, and might have gotten items such as therapeutic agents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is the material useful? Lucien hesitated, still answering this question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seriously nodded: "Many materials have the ability to heal, although they have not been treated with alchemy." There are serious poisoning and other conditions or various sequelae, but I am a big knight and should not die directly. As long as you can get rid of the tracking, it doesn't matter if you can't move for a few months. Oh, Lucien, you can't learn to eat casually. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently took a breath and took the ether, the goblin hair, the burning powder, the vampire blood, etc., and handed it to Nata. Sha saw: "Catch in the magician's storage room." "This lie Lu Xi'an said very embarrassed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha saw the materials, silenced, and then the head squatted on Lucien's shoulder and laughed. Road: "There is really a material that can be used, the blood of the ether and the vampire can be treated, especially the blood of the vampire is very good. "The laughter is clean and clean, and there seems to be no doubt.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two are materials for the powerful therapeutic agent of "Song of Water", which has such a The ability to pass the road is not strange, just ask with concern: "What will be the aftereffects? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha directly extracted the glass tube containing the blood of the vampire: "The effect of the treatment of the ether is effective and it is of little use to me." The blood of the vampire will have blood sequelae that lasts for two months to six months, and will be more fearful during the day. She took off the cork and smelled it, then the voice became excited: "This is the blood of a high vampire, and the collection of legendary magicians is awesome!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
