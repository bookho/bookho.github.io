			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the cognitive world really stopped, except for the extra special spell models and symbols that at first glance seem to be no different from the past. If you carefully distinguish it, you will find that the edge of the world is curved, and there are faint curves around the stars. The elements of the space are more clear, and the protons and neutrons are bound by inexplicable forces. The electrons appear in the shape of a "black cloud", and when carefully observed, it suddenly reverts to the appearance of particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic background of fire, wind, water, there are also minor changes, the electromagnetic waves, the light and the "wind" are linked together, bound the nucleus The inexplicable power has a little bit of water and reflects each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic internal structures are combined in twos and threes to form different spell symbols, which are clustered into two legendary spells of "atomic fission" and "eternal blaze". These two spell models together with more esoteric symbols form a mysterious three-dimensional pattern that is complicated to the extreme and dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the legendary occupation based on the 'new alchemy' system?" Lucien looked curiously, as it has not really entered the field of quantum mechanics. There is no corresponding basic legendary magic, and it is still the previous "fission" and "fusion". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called basic legendary magic is the most fundamental spell of a legendary profession. The spell is the shortest and the easiest to release. Under the same conditions, the semi-plane projection power can be exerted. Natural power is naturally larger than non-fundamental legendary magic. For a legendary occupation, there are only two basic magics at first, one of which is likely to depend on its own semi-planet, but with this field. With the in-depth study and the emergence of new theories, the basic legendary magic is also likely to increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the basic legendary magic of the Semi-God Lich Advanced is "The Devil of the Half-God Lich" and "The Sacrifice of Life", the storm dominates the "Furious Storm" And "storm enchantment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, a legendary career from the new alchemy system, is a bit odd, and neither of the two basic legendary magics relies on the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien finds two elf tree bark papers with powerful power, which is the material that can make high-end reels, and then the new legendary profession and it The two basic legendary magic prints are depicted and depicted above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint refreshing green light emerges, and the three-dimensional pattern of mysterious power is concealed and recorded, of course, in terms of the nature of the material And itâ€™s just a record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the new legendary career?" Lucien pushed the single-lens, didn't take much thought, and used the most direct and most image. one of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen falls, and there are a few more words next to this bark paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atom Take control!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two basic legendary magic, Lucien sees time constraints, or officially named after the original name: "Atomic fission" and "eternal blaze." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another legendary career based on general relativity, Lucien is not printed for the time being, after all, every legendary magician will stay in addition to teaching his own students. The last two special legendary magics are used as cards, so Lucien intends to keep the two fundamental magics in this legendary profession secret and discuss only with the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This new legendary profession is called 'time and space observers'... The two fundamental magics are named 'gravitational fall' and 'time and space'." According to the characteristics of the two legendary magic, they are named separately from the new profession. Unfortunately, this is not a legendary career that they will be promoted. However, after the quantum system is truly established, it will also have its own concept of time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After collecting the bark paper and papers into the storage bag, Lucien discovered that he had already promoted the Nine Rings unconsciously, and the soul center had a more "time." "Stop the magic," thinking a little frowningly: "The more magical power and cognitive world, the more you can feel the so-called 'real world feedback' how strange..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And in the phenomena recorded by the legendary magicians, there is no such a vast and detached starry sky. It is only that it feels in an endless distance, inaccessible places, as if it is closely related to its own soul. Things are high and look down on themselves. I feel like this, but there is more innocent and mysterious 'Unreal Starry Sky'. The feedback from the real world seems to be the interaction it brings..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you walk, you say, but the 'world' channel." Fernando, who is tempered, can't satisfy his curiosity and doubts. He took Lucien and flashed into the room on the 31st floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. In addition, he was told by Samantha and others inside: "Ready to start the show and continue the live broadcast of 'World Reality', by Lucien!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Samantha looked curiously at Lucian and the storm, and opened the relay magic array that had been closed before without delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the arcane artists in the live room are full of excitement and excitement staring at the two, they also have a strong interest in the previous changes in the sky, especially I am eager to know what kind of theoretical support behind the unusual gravitational mapping phenomenon, which will be a great complement to the confidence that they have just been hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando asked with a spiritual connection to Lucien: "What new theory have you made?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, he added another sentence: "Subversion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pulled his mouth: "Teacher, I am not Have you said that, in trying to integrate gravity into the special theory of relativity, and to promote it to a more general reference system, this time has gained something, is being sorted out, and there is still some hesitation, ready to perfect, at least An exact solution, but today's things made me decide to finish ahead of time, and from this system, there is a more realistic interpretation of the nature of gravity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Explanation of the nature of gravity..." Fernando seems to be relieved. "As long as your explanation does not have a supreme existence that creates gravity, then there is no such thing as subversion or subversion of this blank field. What happened later? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said long ago Good reason: "I stayed at the Institute of Atoms tonight, and I was doing experiments to find neutrons. At the end of the semi-solidification of the cognitive world, because I was too excited, I successfully completed the experiment that was suspended before, and then passed the collision. The conservation of momentum and energy determines the existence of neutrons, so the legendary occupation of the new alchemy system is also fed back, letting the cognitive world semi-solidification evolve in this direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too coincidentally, deceived outsiders, did you deceive me!" Fernando whispered, he suspected that Lucien had a direction, after all, when he proposed a new alchemy, he was neutron With very clear prophecy, I just want to rely on the new alchemy to deceive more citation points, and I have not done a similar experiment to perfect it. "You complete this time, it seems that the legendary career wants to go to the new alchemy direction. Close, not the direction of gravity and relativity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slyly: "Yes, the atomic field is the foundation of my research, and it is The direction of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After accepting this explanation from Lucien, Fernando converges on the roaring impulse: "Show me the paper, you are going to prepare for the speech."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, took the paper and handed it to the teacher, and went to Samantha to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another figure emerged. Helen, wearing a white magic robe, came to the "live room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you?" Fernando stared at Helen, regardless of whether he was a man or a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen's slight dagger: "Oliver is coming. He has a lot more than the space in the space blockade, so give him to open the 'real secret', I have come to see Look at Evans's thesis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said this sentence with secret communication, so as not to cause panic in the live arcanists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando raised the papers that had not yet been opened, and both of them saw the long topic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Relativistic Interpretation of Gravity and Description of Geometric Forms and the System of Relativity under the More General Reference System"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relativity..." Helen remembers Lucien I claimed that I would like to incorporate gravity into this system and promote it. I donâ€™t think he really finished it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two opened the paper and fell into a state of concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha smiled and said to the magical front: "Before our radio band was held by Pope Benedict III, some lie was made and caused A certain degree of panic, so we apologize to the magicians, this is our mistake, then Mr. Lucien Evans clarified the previous things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa, Black was still immersed in the change of the heavens before and after, and suddenly heard the words of crisp and sweet, which suddenly awake. Miss Larks started the live broadcast again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the interpretation of this matter by the Parliament? What will Mr. Evans say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tension and anticipation filled his heart, and the subconscious went to the front of the magic radio. He listened intently to the slightly low voice of Lucien Qingyue. He said: "The previous thing was the conspiracy of the church. What to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not know what was specifically concealed in the conversation, and also knew the true state of the Speaker, so he did not categorically reject it, but The pen has been played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But itâ€™s unsatisfactory for Black and other arcane masters who are in front of the magic radio to be too perfunctory and unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element will be in the headquarters of Lavindi finally got the answer from Annonis, understand that some people know the world is semi-cured, he guessed according to the final scene is likely Is Lucien? Evans, suddenly relaxed in the heart, but fortunately no major events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this matter was explained, the former controversy of the Lordâ€™s gravitational remarks came to his mind, and he began to think about the essence of gravity. What is it, and at this time, Lucienâ€™s clarified statement made him slightly frown, too vague, is it really a problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to say because Benedict IIIâ€™s problem does not have to rely on the first impetus. Regarding the nature of gravity, I have my own Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi, Annonis, Black, etc. The magician who listened to the radio and watched the black box in shock, seemed to see it directly through it. Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "live room", Samantha and other arcans were also shocked. They only hoped that Lucien had a deeper research on gravity. Unexpectedly, he directly answered one of the ultimate questions that made Douglas confused before, which is the mystery of the gravitational field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helenâ€™s fine eyebrows and wrinkles, the principle of equivalence in the front and the principle of general relative surnames, she is easy to understand, and the geometrical language description behind makes her look dull. Some of them are stunned to Fernando: "Every word, every symbol, I know, but they are connected together, I don't understand what it means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Fernando is also struggling to see: "This is the application of Evans Geometry and its related analysis tools. If you haven't studied Nature for the last three years, I'm afraid it's hard to understand in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also studied the journal Nature in the mindset of examining his studentsâ€™ papers, which allowed him to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone should know that I am trying to integrate gravitational theory into the relativistic system and solve the problem of extending to all reference systems. In fact, the thesis of the special theory of relativity is in one I have done it years ago, so I have been working hard in this area since this time. It is full of difficulties, especially when I discovered that the previous geometry could not be used to describe this theory, it was almost paused until I came to chance. I noticed that the Evans geometry and related content I studied can perfectly support this theoretical system, and this has the progress of breaking through the surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calmly The speech made the nervous and eager Arcane and other arcanes calm down. It seems that he really found the essence of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When the theory established by this geometric system is about to take shape, I am in a state of pause, and there are some problems without thinking until I listen to Benedict After the forged conversations of the Three Worlds, I was inspired to perfect the final equation. I can get this general theory of relativity and get an explanation of the nature of gravity. I want to thank my teacher Fernando, the Magic Council, and Pope Benedict III." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienâ€™s humorous words made most of the arcane masters in the live room laugh, and Black and others couldnâ€™t help but smile, before the lost and lost I know where I have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
