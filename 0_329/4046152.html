			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the sparkling lake, the back of the steep cliff stands a dark, gloomy, vine-covered castle, with a towering tower heading into the sky, as if Dark forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road behind the boulder is looking at this ancient city of Karendia, which is obviously with the architectural style of the Dark Ages. Tones, move the "Avenue of the Snow" ring to the ring finger of the left hand, and then take out the "Holm Crown" award ring "谟" given by Natasha, and wear it on the left index finger of the more obvious position, but engraved with " The front of the word "谟" was turned to Lucifer by the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of unknown dangers, Lucien must use all resources to face the castle owners who may be terrible in strength and the Necromancers from the Confucius Magic Council. Improve your security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the spellcasting and becoming calm, like the snow and ice, Lucien walked out from behind the boulder and walked towards the castle of Karendia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool night winds of June blew away the heat of the day, and the sounds of insects were intermittently coming around. Lucien had not walked to the gates of the castle. Any blockages and movements appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmly reached out and flexed his fingers, and “咚咚咚” rhythmically tapped the door made of thick iron wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three consecutive times, Lucien stopped knocking and waited quietly there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three minutes, the castle gate screamed slowly, and then the heavy friction with the ground sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two or three strong men at this gate may not be able to pull, but it is a black cap, black suit and white shirt. The old man with a light brown hair, he strictly adhered to the etiquette of the nobility, and asked in a standard continental common accent: "Who are you, Mr. Why come to the castle of Karendia?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no direct action, and the matter was successful. Lu Xi’s courtesy smiled: “Mr. Dear Butler, I am a magician who traveled through the Djibouti Principality...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Lu Xienton paused and saw the old butler’s expression still serious and continued to say: “I met a band of robbers in the wilderness of Longya Town, they tried I robbed me, but I was killed one by one. What surprised me was that I found an invitation from a robber who was invited by the mainland’s Magic Council headquarters to invite the undead of the former Wilfrid territory. Master, apprentice to Guibao to attend the 'Death Feast' party "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it might be that an unfortunate magic apprentice has been found by a robber and found a letter, but fortunately they don't know the words. And I am right." The death feast was very interested, so I took the risk of visiting the address of the Karen Erdia Castle recorded by the apprentice on the invitation letter, and asked your host to forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Respected guests, what is the sign on the invitation?" The old butler's expression did not change, as if he was not an evil horror in front of him, but an ordinary businessman or traveler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the old butler couldn’t see the look inside the black hood, Lucien still kept the perfect etiquette smile: “The invitation is a black six-pointed star.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler gently said: "Respected guests, please allow me to report my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He held a white candle in the candlestick, and turned to the depths of the dark and dark castle in the dim light yellow light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood still, did not step forward and wait there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler seems to be walking very slowly, but wait until his figure disappears into the darkness, and the dim candlelight lights up again, then he walks I walked slowly to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear guests, you have very good courtesy and know how to respect others." The old housekeeper narrowed his eyes and looked at Lucien’s unmoved feet. "My lord, Count Karen Erdia, invites you to meet in the study. Please follow me. Please be sure to follow me, don't get lost in the dark, it will be very dangerous."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler did not say anything, holding the candlestick and turning slowly, Lu Xien quickly followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staying away from the castle gate, the darkness suddenly squirmed on both sides, but when Lucien looked at it seriously, they were calm and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensation of Lucien’s destiny, powerful spirit, and 'vigilance' intuition makes him always think that he is hidden in the darkness that the candlelight does not shine. There are countless horrible and dangerous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of a group seems to be "normally shaking" with the illumination of the candlelight. It seems that Lucien's heart is slightly hairy, and the whole body is tight, not Dare to follow the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the old butler suddenly stopped, then pushed forward, a door slowly opened, the bright yellow light shone, all the darkness subsided . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear guests, please." The old butler was half-squatting, his right hand bent and stretched, indicating that Lucien advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly: "Thank you, Mr. Housekeeper." Then he calmly and decisively walked into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark yellow thick carpet, gold-carved coat rack, more than a dozen silver candlesticks on both sides of the wall, made of dark red precious wood The desks, bookcases, and the richly detailed details of the rooms all show the owner’s taste and luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a set of red leather sofas in front of the desk, sitting on a blond gilt man in a black shirt and red jacket, his facial features are deep and handsome. Full of manly taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Magician." The blond man is very lazy on the sofa, not standing up to say hello, the strict observance of etiquette The old butler walked quickly to his side and whispered in his ear: "Master, please keep the etiquette of the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien politely replied: Hello, Viscount Kareldia, thank you for not taking the liberty of visiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia is smiling at the side of the old housekeeper Road: "Ned Steward, you see that this magician does not mind if I sit, you can relax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Earl is just fine He is an elegant and noble example..." The old housekeeper sighed and stood no further to the side of the Viscount of Karendia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viscount of Karendardia held his forehead and made a sad sorrow: "But I have only a vague impression of my grandfather, how can I learn his etiquette?" He pointed to the sofa: "Mr. Magician, please sit. You know what you are, but how do I believe that you are not the church watchman? They are not missing the magician who surrendered."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he mentions the church, he is not too concerned about it, his right finger flicks on the arm of the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calmly said the answer that was prepared long ago: "I have a nickname 'professor'."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor? The 355th professor of the church purification sequence?!" The lazy expression of Viscount Kareldia disappeared and asked dignifiedly. Because every one of the church purification sequences is a horrible strongman, such as the Great Arcanist, the legendary magician, the Northern Cardinal Cardinal, the Taigu Dragon, the vampire ancestor, the werewolf prince, the Taoist fisherman, the cult leader, etc. The worst is also the day knight level. The professor can be on the list with the strength of the middle-level magician, which is enough to show that he has something extraordinary, maybe there is the strength of the high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He really knows." Lucien was a little relieved. The lower class of the magic apprentice level, even the ordinary magician may not be clear about the list of church purification sequences. If it is not the strongman who has certain status and strength, such as Viscount Kareldia, he only quotes the code of "professor". It is treated as a fresh word: "Yes, I am a professor who returned from Aalto to the eastern part of the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia looked up and down Lucifer En, his eyes suddenly condensed, saw his right hand gently rubbing the ring of his left index finger, and then re-exposed a lazy smile: "Oh, even I have not been able to go to the church's purification sequence, Professor Mr. You must have Extraordinary strength. But how do you prove that you are a professor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
