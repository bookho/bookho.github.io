			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peves County, Samara Town, Baroque Baron Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are still immersed in the song that seems to be bursting out from the depths of the soul, everywhere is quiet, even the children who are not sensible to be held by their parents are also due to this atmosphere. Infected without a bit of noise, the whole square is like a cage in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling that the souls are trembled is that they are unprecedented. The past operas, music is music, and the plot is a plot. The two are not only difficult to complement each other, but also promote each other. There is also a disconnect between them, so even if there have been some unusual classic arias in the history of opera, most of the audiences are unable to resonate deeply with music because their emotions are not in place or out of touch. There is a wonderful feeling that this soul is touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time, "Valkyrie", the plot is step by step, the full symphony-like melody is fully rendered, and the two are definitely more than "1+1" The harmonious cooperation of the effects allows the audience's emotions to fully integrate into the story, blend into the music, and rise and fall with their ups and downs, sadness and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when "A Charge" was played, they seemed to be on the battlefield themselves, and they also followed the princess charge, so in the "Tomb of the Heroes" When singing from the princess, they can truly understand the tragic, sad, missing, firm and deep soul of the soul, can not help but numb the scalp, from the depths of the soul to produce a moving shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien dare not say that the story of this opera is perfect, more than any playwright's work, but can be proud to say. Its impact on the audience is unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, the low voice was heard in the square:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heroes will never "dead"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will only slowly fade away in people's memory"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl controls I can't stop myself, whispering the last aria, although she doesn't have the ethereal voice of the singer who plays the princess, and she doesn't have that kind of treble, even if she is currently selling it because the difficulty is too high. However, she also sings so carefully, so affectionate, as if she has witnessed her comrades-in-arms and friends who fell down on their own side for a noble purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indescribable ethereal song broke the silence of the square. Caused a series of reactions. Banus, Ali and others have opened their mouths and sang along with them:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"bury my bones, don't erect tombstones"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This rich plain and bustling city is our best tombstone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song lingers in Baron Becky Square, over and over again. It seems that the soul of a hero pays attention to his beloved home. Reluctant to leave! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time later. The citizens got rid of this atmosphere and discussed it with each other enthusiastically to discuss "Women." Discuss the changes that Master Evans brought to the opera, discuss classic music such as "Morning" and "Assault", discuss "The Tombstone of Heroes" and other lyrics that transcend the genre, discuss the top opera actor and the seemingly awkward giant Dragon, discuss this "live" feast of sight and hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this discussion, Ali changed a few times, then suddenly turned and walked outside the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ali, where are you going?" Banus is excitedly communicating with the stranger next to him tonight's feelings and discovering Ali's move, unusually unexpected. And doubts, isn't he the most favorite to join in the fun? Is there a place more lively than the square at this time? After listening to the opera, is there no point in the mood that he can't wait to share with others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali is serious and implicitly excited: "Go home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do home "Banus gave up the communication with the other people, caught up with Ali, and asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali’s right hand unconsciously clasped: “Pick up your luggage and get ready to go to Runta!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ali shook his head: "I am not crazy, I think very clearly, I am going to Rentat, I don't want to stay in Samara for a lifetime, stay in a small town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but what's wrong with the small town?" Banus was astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali took a breath and pointed to the "curtain" behind the square: "Banus, have you seen it? Can let us see the distant sight heard Alchemy items in the distant voice, which allows us to enjoy the operas performed by Renttat even in the small town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the small town can also appreciate it." Why do you want to go to Rentat?” Banus is even more puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali slowly sighed: "Banus, what does this alchemy item represent behind? What can the small city also have such an alchemy item? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked himself and said, "This represents our kingdom. The era we live in is undergoing tremendous changes that have not happened in the past few hundred years." Every day, new things are born, and every day can feel the vitality of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus nodded, even if he was in a small city Mara, he can also feel this through the changes around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This change is like a flood, it is coming, it is not something we can stop, the only thing we can do is to adapt to it, and I am not willing, not reconciled In such an era where great changes have taken place, Banus, you have to think about whether such a big change is full of opportunities. As long as we grasp one of them, our lives will be completely different." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not willing to live in a small town like a pool of stagnant water, calmly inheriting my father's position, becoming a clerk's entourage, and then without any surprise with one The girl of the same status marries, has children, is busy, and grows old. This can clearly foresee the life that makes me afraid. My life has been doomed from the beginning? So, I am going to Renttat to pursue my dreams, even in the world. In the big development that will change, find your own position and make the most effort for each step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali used several unwilling to express himself Urgency . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cos Samara is changing, and getting married, having children, being busy, getting older is a process that everyone will experience, even if you pursue your dreams. The same is true.” Banus tried to calm himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This process does happen to everyone. But this process can also be full of excitement, full of things that I long for, Banus, Samara is indeed changing However, such changes lag far behind Lentstadt, and only then can you feel how strong the pulse of the times is, and you can get the fastest chance to change your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I am going to Renttat, whether I am going to a general school or a Buffalo school. I am going to work in various newly developed industries. I think I can learn and get in touch. It is enough to change my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali's tone gradually calmed down, but it became more and more determined, using the "voice of mystery" to hear the "pulse of the times" Describe the need to go to Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus looked at Ali’s eyes and felt the insistence. So I was silent. Then do the final persuasion: "Uncle Bissa will not agree. And although there are many opportunities for Rentat, it is not something that ordinary people like us can meet. Maybe you can't get anything. There is poverty. Poor, no one knows and dies in a simple house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, maybe I will fail, maybe I will accomplish nothing, maybe I will be dingy Going back to Samara, I can find that my failure is the most ridiculous and meaningless thing. If it is the closest to our ordinary people, it is most likely to grasp. Live, don't fight now, don't you have to wait for a more difficult future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication with "pen pals" has allowed Ali to learn a lot of things about the world. The understanding has been substantially improved. "As for my father, I will explain to him. Even if he does not want to support me, I will not change my mind. I am an adult. It is my own responsibility to support myself, no matter what tragic. The end, all ! Own choice, Banus, go together, together we create a bright future in Lun Tate "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
