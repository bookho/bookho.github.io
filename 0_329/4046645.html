			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the words of Lucien are very light and low, but the members of the top ten judges present at least are also the nine-ring Master, how can they not understand? And listening to them in their ears, this is more loud than the thunder roaring, destruction and collapse, as if the sound of the explosion directly in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon the original concept to see the truth of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electrons that have consistently exhibited the perfect particle surname have actually exhibited an unusually classic diffraction pattern when bombarding the crystal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ridiculous degree is like the sun hanging high, the cloudless, the sights are bright landscapes during the day is actually the hands of the fingers, cold and silent night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a holy and beautiful angel is actually a stupid devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More exaggerated than imagination, more strange than magic, more unpredictable than the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, including the Speaker of the Magic Council of Douglas, all the great arcans who hold the strongest interest and persistent pursuit of the mysteries of the world, bear Can not help but shake his head, this completely subverts and refreshes their understanding of the world, completely beyond their real imagination, everything is so eccentric, like the most incredible monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other legendary magicians and masters have their right hand subconsciously raised, holding their mouths, some hands clasped, as if to crush the palm Some things, some bite the lips, seem to distinguish whether this is an illusion through pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are chasing the truth of the world all the time, but when the truth is slightly unveiled, let them see part of the "face", they are Scared and repeatedly "regressed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely different from the usual experience and intuitive understanding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives them a feeling of never knowing the world before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the vistas of storm lightning, starlight snowflakes, etc. all converge, Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, Fernando and others set up a magic array, ready to verify this experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Lucy’s magical array is done under their noses, even if Brooke’s personal stream is ejected, they’ll have to rigorously verify themselves. Choose to believe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a single crystal..." Lucien screamed out loud and briefly described some information about the single crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heathery nodded lightly and began to prepare as described by Lucien, as did other members of the highest panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, more than a dozen compound magic arrays were successfully placed, and a large single crystal was placed in the center of the magic circle, Brooke, Fernando, Oliver, The magician who specializes in the electromagnetic field, such as the Starry Light, directly emits the electron flow, while others use various magic or items to assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the beautiful and dreamy dim and dark diffraction images appeared in Brooke’s magical array, and then, one after another, throughout the conference room Intertwined with light and dark, empty and illusory, quiet to no slightest movement, solidified like a mysterious and strange sketch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low thunder sounds like a repressed roar, the tidal elements of the elements, the paradise of alchemy and other visions reappear, gold, silver, black, green and other elements of various colors The light spots have become quite vague and seem to be unable to stabilize and will soon collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, after a few seconds, everything was quiet, and the members of the top panel of directors controlled the intense emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supporters of particle theory such as Hathaway, because of the previous debate, have already prepared for the special performance of the particle, and it can also be used to solve the problem of the new alchemy, so it quickly stabilized after the censored world was shaken. Down, there was no tragedy of broken solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is where they stand on the top of the world, regardless of the degree of temperament, vision, insight, etc. than the other arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The microcosm is more incredible than we think." There was a faint horror and shock on the cold face of Hathaway, and the gaze looked slightly in front of the diffraction. The image has a passion for the deepest mysteries of the world, and there is also some subconscious resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Douglas waved and removed his magical array, and said, "In the past, we thought that the microcosm was only a reduction in scale, and it was a re- Segmentation is a world composed of various microscopic particles. It has a corresponding relationship with the macrocosm. The difficulty in studying it lies in the discovery of particles and their models of different elements. There is no essential difference between them and the real world. Concepts, formulas, and movement systems, who knows, the microscopic particles themselves are completely different from everything we have known in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it has The incredible surname, whether it is a wave that represents the particle's surname, or a particle that exhibits a fluctuating surname, or that Lucien says it is neither a wave nor a particle, but a substance that we cannot accurately describe, unimaginable, They are full of incredible feelings." Oliver still wants to explain this situation from the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook sighed softly: "It seems that I really want to give up the original concept. This is really an incredible 'world'."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s hands are still in the pocket of the black double-breasted long dress, smiling: “The only incredible, such incredible is the reality that we try to get close, isn’t it? It is not advisable to simply introduce the reality of the world into the microscopic world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a hunch that the microscopic field will be over and over again Change our worldview everywhere, let us know what secrets can be seen in the real world that can be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light is the electronic wave of the surname My world view, Evans, you are really three devastators." Klaus said exaggeratedly, did not hide his bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said to Douglas, Hathaway, Fernando and others: "The variety of magic is varied and varied, in clergy, knights, The hearts of ordinary people are incredible, incredible, and our imagination is more strange and exaggerated than magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the mystery of the micro world is definitely more bizarre than imagined, More subversive common sense, because our imagination is based on experience and knowledge, and we cannot break through, but in the microscopic field, past experience and knowledge are likely to be largely unfounded or even completely violated, even if imagination is unimaginable, more than everything. Myths and legends, all heroic stories, all fantasy poems, but also rich in unreal, not magical atmosphere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is such a field, only more Being close to reality will make us so fascinated and so focused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas closed his eyes as if intoxicated in the diffraction image: "If not the world Reality is full of all kinds of secrets, and how can it attract us to explore and study tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of years, and how can we make such a process and harvest as the greatest pleasure, even if it dies. I don't regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the initial shock and incredible, I ignited the electrons, the light, and the micro world more than ever before. The curiosity of the flames, I want to explore this unimaginable material." Brooke is also full of praise and admire the microcosm that is more than fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando burst into a foul language: "This makes me feel bad, as if the things I studied before have no value, but this is also my XXX's motivation. Because I haven't researched anything yet, I haven't learned anything yet. The truth of the world is like an innocent starry sky. I am still playing on one of the planets, accidentally picking up some gems."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente beats the red flame and looks at Lucien: "Since the microscopic particles can show fluctuating surnames, why do we not have a fluctuating surname, which consists of microscopic particles, but It really exists here. Dieppe's paper can also be directly extended to macroscopic materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
