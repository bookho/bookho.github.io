			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Natasha didn’t understand too much why Lucien was so serious, his attitude and firm attitude towards causality still made his heart uncomfortable. It is the ice and snow that has melted into the sun quickly. Everything has been doomed. The world that cannot be changed at all is the most desperate and most lifeless world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the warmth of being held, listening to the solemn and solemn voice, Natasha, whose name is cheerful and optimistic, quickly recovered his true color and no longer entangled in this topic. , smiled and said: "Would you like to create an opera for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Lucien was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and said: "My eyes are very sharp. I saw a manuscript on the shelf in your study in the afternoon, "Women," I think it should be for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no modesty for the title of "Valkyrie", and it is natural that she should be herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed softly: "I originally planned to invite the opera company to perform on the day of my birth, to commemorate the first anniversary of our mutual confession. For the year of Sarde, for the Magic Council and our future, there has been no extra time to create, and the script is harder than I thought, and music is even more so, only one third is completed today." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is based on the works on earth, it is basically a new long-form creation, which makes Lucien encounter a lot of difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled indifferently: "It doesn't matter, you can wait for next year, the next year, and many, many years. When it comes to opera, I plan to sponsor Lenta. The Association of Musicians encourages the development of music and reshapes a city of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a real love of music, since she is temporarily unable to return to Alto, Then let Rantart become a holy place for music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is free time, I will guide the musicians of Rentat." Lucien at this time has already said that this is the case, this time Although the creation of Wushen is difficult, it allows you to truly integrate the musical knowledge you have learned. It is no longer the strength of ordinary musicians who can only write piano pieces and adapt some music, almost the level of Victor's teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rapid progress has benefited from the learning of many advanced musical knowledge in the Soul Library, thanks to the efforts of his own efforts and the increased speed of thinking brought by the soul. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the avenue of the night, the cool breeze is refreshing, Natasha takes a deep breath and humorously said: "Then I will first thank the masters of the Holm Kingdom for the masters. If you don't mind, I want your uncle Joel to enter the association and pass Alto's music trends and latest developments here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light The "Music Review" and "Symphon Guide" that are smuggled can obviously only show the top things, and the musicians can't learn the real foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly don't mind, as long as Uncle Joel is willing to do it." In the years of communication, Lucien learned from Natasha's mouth that at the beginning of the nobility After the excitement of life, Joel restarted the study of music, very hard, not like a middle-aged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha glanced at Lucien, and the silver-purple eyes were smiling: "I said this topic is to ask you, when will I meet?" Uncle Joel, the church has been withdrawn, there should be no other danger. The intelligence personnel who secretly protect them also report, under the influence of the voice of mystery, under the enjoyment of convenient alchemy items around them, they are against the magician. And the clergy's point of view has changed significantly, there should be no excessive reaction, and they should still miss you in their hearts. In order to know your news, they often stay up late to listen to the 'world real' channel that they don't understand at all." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to Natasha’s simple description, Lucien’s heart suddenly filled with emotion and warmth. It’s been more than eight years since I came to this world, but it’s been like a lifetime. After going through countless things, the voice was low and said: "I will go these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy, this kind of thing should be happy." Natasha Fun to do the gesture of inspiring the charge, by the way Topic, "Mr. Musician, have there been any musical ideas for changing the surname in the past few years? You have always been known for subverting surnames, and works that have not been innovative and changed for several years are really unaccustomed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey? Music creation and mathematics? How can this be linked?” Natasha was amazed that music is full of free and unrestrained thoughts, while mathematics is the most rigorous and most restrained field. How can they be put together? It’s not the twelve temperament law that divides the surname and the concept surname. It is creation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "So it is a subversion of the surname, giving up the traditional structural factors, such as the theme, music logic, music motivation, phrases, music Segments, etc., the elements of the physical surname, such as rhythm, velocity, note density, timbre, etc., are mathematically arranged into a sequence, and then created according to such regulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seems too cold...but it's fun, don't know how it works?" Natasha knows that this won't be the mainstream, and she has the courage to try it, plus the status of the road in the mind, there is no contradiction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she sighed again: "This is really the thinking of the Arcanist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Go back and show you some small works." This is the sequence of music that Lucien converted to thinking and relax the brain, and later it can be used in electronic music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if you are good, you will teach me late tonight!" Natasha is very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deliberately misrepresented her meaning, jokingly said: "Day and night? What do you seem to be escaping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where? I am an escaped person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The next day, after Natasha left, Lucien stepped back to the Atomic Research Institute and many experiments needed to be verified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, good looks!" Lazar took a look I knew, holding a journal in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Arcane" was released in advance?" Lucien looked at the cover very much, but the highest commenting group only asked the journal cover to post itself as a great arcian The news did not require them to be issued so much in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi is still worrying about the tasks of yesterday, and he said: "Teacher, this is a special issue of "Arcane", because the discovery of neutrons makes new Alchemy has been confirmed, so they have specially made this special issue to celebrate this theoretical system of changing the times. It contains more than a year of papers, including the confirmation of various alchemy predictions, and some related experiments. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and some questions about the imperfections of the new alchemy." Annick silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprint is somewhat angry: "The teacher has long said that the new alchemy is just a framework, many questions have not been resolved, why are they still in the special issue? Collecting the questions? Why can't you wait until the next month's republication? The general feeling is to question the teacher's new alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this? Any theory is perfect and sturdy in the conservative questioning. If there is no doubt, I will be uneasy. Besides, there are still many problems that cannot be solved in the new alchemy. For example, it cannot accurately describe the atomic structure of multiple electrons, such as Can predict the frequency of the line, can't do anything about its intensity, width, etc." Lucien understands the limitations of the current model of the new alchemy, and the mentality is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina nodded: "These teachers said these questions, there are journals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucien reached out to "Arcane" and found that the silver-white lines on the dark black cover formed several lines of text, the top two words: "Arcane", the next three rows are "July 824, To celebrate the establishment of the new alchemy and to congratulate Lord Lucien Evans on his title as a Great Arcanist, this issue is specially issued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The page is written by Douglas The paper added: "There is no doubt that the new alchemy has won a brilliant victory, which has greatly changed our time and will always be remembered by the Arcans. I suggest to add a reward of 15,000 points to the Arcane points. 500,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him was the opinion of the two audit committees, and Lavendi and Prado wrote a sentence: "Now, we The accolades in the previous review comments can be fully added to Lord Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
