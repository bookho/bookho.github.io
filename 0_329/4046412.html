			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light ball is constantly shrinking and expanding, and the light is shining in white light. Lu Xi’s slender fingers flash silvery white, and it is necessary to touch the edge of it, suddenly it’s hard Stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien only feels that his heart is beating vigorously, just like pulling out of the chest, almost the same as the bulging frequency of a strange ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did I choose such an adventurous move?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am on this ball of light The situation is completely unclear, so dare to try to touch it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if it explodes? If it contains a strange curse? If it carries a legendary rating Attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s forehead has a thin layer of cold sweat, and there is a strong fear in the heart. If it is not at the last minute, it is customary. Careful and careful to hesitate a bit, to restore calm and sober, I am afraid that now has touched the ball of light, let the illusory fate to dominate his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was just blinded by greed and curiosity, knowing that this ball of light is very strange, but still can't help but reach out and touch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'I' seems to be skeptical that the light ball hides the mystery of the dead world, hiding the secret of the Sun King Tanos, hiding the mystery of the unknown, hiding the present The field that Arcane has not yet explored, so it becomes difficult to restrain itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retracted his right hand and looked at the light group in front of him, his heart Analysis of previous emotional changes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a question of underground palaces, or is it the influence of the 'greed' devil?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also or is the difference in the light group itself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, they are actually the same thing? They have close ties to each other ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of inferences emerged in the mind of Lucien, and soon there was a decision: "You can't blindly study the light ball, look for the sun first." Have you left any relevant information, hey, the time is a bit tight, you can't delay any more, you must immediately hold a magic ceremony and start the arrangement of Mr. Rhein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The inner layer of the palace was carefully inspected by the Rhine. There was no harvest outside of the magical array, so Lucien did not intend to waste time here. Instead, Sophia, Relf, ​​and Bayer had the secret of the Sun King in their mouth. Places are very likely to store related books and notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gorse brooch containing mysterious power, Lucien carefully placed it on the left chest of the statue of Tanos, as if it should have there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps back, Lucien began to open the magic array with complex gestures and difficult spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the battle progressed, Frederick’s raised blood vessels became denser and denser, almost completely covering his pale face, full of strange secrets. Hehe, but the more he is, the stronger his strength is, and he has completely suppressed the Prince of Bayer, and even using short-range teleports will be interrupted just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He showed a level higher than the level of the Grand Knight, so that Alten, who was upgraded by equipment, could no longer participate in the battle and could not keep up with their pace. Can only step back and hold one of the gates to prevent Bayer from escaping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only him, but Denny is gradually getting out of the fight, because Frederick does not seem to consider the existence of the next companion at all, hegemonic and arrogant attack If he rushed to the front, he was easily injured by him, so he also retired from another door and completely shunned Bayer’s escape route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the remote caster Sophia caught up with Frederick’s rhythm, and the ropes of the wind, the magnetic field, the vertigo, etc. made Bayer suffer. Words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Frederick just touched the madman on the edge of the Knights of the Sky, he thought he should be able to stay outside and find it wrong, forcibly open the underground palace, but now Every second seems to be a luxury to enjoy, because I don't know if I can stop the attack of the next second! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Alten changed his face and turned to open the door of the hall. He quickly said: "Jocelyn, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing a close-fitting rose scale A. Jocelyn's face pale, stumbled into the hall and rushed to Alten: "Fast, run! Andris is crazy, he becomes a monster, good, disgusting, horrible monster!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Alten’s experience is not rich enough. For a moment, I don’t know if I should use Joslin with my right hand, and I will take the shield of my left hand to guard against Bayer’s escape, or the left hand to appease She, the right-handed sword, made an alert look, or pushed her away directly, suddenly rushed and changed her posture, while doubting but not asking in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say monsters, there is a "only" here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jortherin seems to have been greatly intimidated, the official knight’s will tends to collapse: "Monsters, Andris became a monster, killing a lot People, not right, ate a lot of people! Run fast, Alten runs fast, take me out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the back she is already scared and crying The crystal tears slid across the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to adjust the posture, let Jocelyn squat on her chest, and Bayer failed to take the opportunity to get rid of Frederick’s entanglement, Altenton quietly The ground is relieved, and then I am afraid of the tunnel: "Eat, eat a lot of people? What happened to Andris? Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know Andris suddenly became a monster, then, then I don't know how he forgot me..." Jocelyn couldn't help but flustered and failed to let Alten understand that Andris had happened. What changed, things were not serious, so I turned my attention to Sophia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia wrinkled the leafy golden eyebrows, letting Alten feel a little pampered, then she pointed to Frederick and let Alten Don't worry, what about Andris becoming a monster? There is a heavenly knight here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten immediately relaxed, yes, and Mr. Frederick, he seems to have begun to slowly grasp the power of the outer Cavaliers. What are the monsters afraid of? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he was concerned about the struggle before the complete defeat of Bayer, while comforting Jocelyn, and Sophia also used magic to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light green brilliance emerged on Jocellin, full of tranquility and softness, and her almost collapsed mood gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Jocelyn’s nightmare look disappeared, watching Bayer comfort her with warm words, watching Deni stay aside and look at the other The aristocratic children were alert and watched the monster-like Frederick, and the hair was scattered. Six pairs of wings were broken like Bayer, and Sophia had a smug and ironic smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Greed is the greatest original sin, and you will be punished for this, and Frederick can no longer control the power of the devil, when your pain begins. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she looked at the "Bolak" that stood like a fool, and looked at Relf with a fascinating "love" and gestured to him. Be prepared, wait for Bolac to hide in the Chamber with himself and Clare, and let Alten be killed by the monster Frederick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait to get the secret of the Sun King, that is, the presence of Lord Midalun, will kill the prince, the monsters of many noble children, and summon this horror monster It’s time for the evil wizards to be removed together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, a heir candidate for the gorse family, because he has never been able to stimulate blood, he lost Belief, deceived by the devil, embarked on the path of the evil magician, and later accidentally got the method of summoning the devil from the broken book of the family secret and the spell that briefly changed the magical arrangement of the underground palace, so I intend to defeat all The candidate, stealing the title of the Earl of Goldeneye, and completely remove the aftermath."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil that the summoned call is out of control, attached to a secret guard After the cruel killing, when the 'Glory Crown' smashed the magical shackles to save everyone, only the poor princess Sophia survived in time to hide in the secret room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us brave and honest of His Royal Highness Prince Baier Mo sorrow, for the faithful guard of silence ...... Altenburg is stupid but 'good' Pollack silence ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Her gaze looked at the ponytail, delicate and determined Denny, with a hint of guilt and apologetic: "Deni, I am sorry, this matter is too important, except me, Uncle Ulrich, Midalun You, all those who know who passed by must die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only dead people who can't even find their bodies and souls can keep their secrets!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the strength of the Duke of the Golden Sparrow and the "Glory of the Glory" is not something she can deal with, she definitely chooses to know the secret only by herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer’s eyes are all Frederick’s afterimages. There is no one who can tell who is true or not. The arm is extremely heavy and has reached the limit of physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer’s face is firm, the will is not shaken, behind The wings of the hanging light suddenly unfolded and sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pieces of feathers fall, the wings of light disappear rapidly, and the body of Baier shrouds the sacred light, even the green "Devil's Horn" is illuminated by the Holy Light. It was stained with a layer of milky white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wrath of Justice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Sophia blurted out, this is " The Angel of Justice "The blood of the blood becomes the talent of the Knights of Heaven!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a level 1 damage to all evil creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer has not yet become a Knight of Heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pure light flashed away, illuminating the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light subsided, Bayer gasped with a long sword, and the golden hair withered, and only the wrinkled scalp was left, and he Actually still standing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick stepped back a few steps, a bloody smack appeared on his face, and then the blood marks spread rapidly, seemingly splitting his entire population into two half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Victory?" Bayer was pleasantly surprised that he had not had much strength to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia's face changed slightly: "Dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denni, Alten, etc. Deep earthquake, Bayer still has such a terrible card? What should I do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of Frederick’s mouth, which was quickly separated, suddenly tilted up, revealing a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone was shuddered by this strange smile, the blood vessels that Frederick’s face, hands, and body showed were falling. Like countless heart-wrenching dark red tentacles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon-like blood vessels are in the air, and the doors and walls are completely covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main scarlet is like a needle that is deeply plunged into the body of the ground. Soon, these bodies are concentrated and become smaller and squeezed into it. Intravascular, flowing to Frederick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incorporate me, this is what I deserve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick The voice of a greedy voice is like a nightmare, and the wounds of the cockroaches quickly recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorline was frightened again, disgusted and scared The scene was shocked, and the eyes of Alten, Deni and others became alert, with a hint of doubt and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hes still a person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it get out of hand? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia sees that there is no dense vascular network at the entrance to the secret room, so she drags Claire to move there and signals to Ralph to take Borak. This monster is more horrible than imagined, can no longer wait for<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
