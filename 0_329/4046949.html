			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rainstorms, like waterfalls falling from the sky, hitting the ground, splashing a faint mist of water, and the surroundings are completely dark, except for the occasional lightning flashes across the sky, bright and dazzling It is like a ghost of no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are basically no one who dares to go out at night, and the heavy rain has made every house isolated, which makes people have the fear of the end of the day, and there is no fear. The strange security that others have come in, the water curtain is like the wall of a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a common second-floor house in the city, a young man wearing a bright red magic robe is staring at the rain curtain, his eyes are deep, I don’t know. What, his appearance is about twenty years old, his eyes are red and bloody, his facial features are beautiful, his splendid but shining thunder and light snake, his freshness, and his faint scroll of books makes him add a refined, composed. Unique temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, did you tell those words to Count Pefus?" The door of the room opened and a young man dressed in "fashion" left. Coming in, he wore a popular black turtleneck coat, and the neckline stood tall, reaching the top of his head, and his ears were completely covered by shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a slender cheek, a good-looking character, and two mustaches. He also has a knowledgeable temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! I did things, when did I get through?" The young man, who was called Fernando, turned his head and whispered almost roaringly, then he Waved to stop the other person's approach, "Roland, I told you, don't be too close to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is holding back the smile, not too much What he said, consciously stood a little farther, because he was tall and tall, and he was a little taller than the short Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Count Pefus?" Roland touched his mustache. The expression began to become serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando was annoyed and said: "What can I do? I only met for the first time. He hasn’t figured out what the situation is! If he does, he dares to agree. I would doubt it is a trap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of words, and his short body is like an infinite force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, take your time, but we have to move somewhere tomorrow, don't be stared by the group of 'black claw dogs'." Roland nodded lightly. The "black claw dog" is their name for the night watchman who has killed many magicians, from the black gloves they wear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has no opinion on this, although his temper is more violent. In the past, because of the mistake of a certain magical knowledge, even the teacher dared to collide. In spite of the fact that the ancient magical empire passed down the middle-class teacher-student relationship, but the night watchman pursued it for so long, even his own teacher was killed by the cardinal, and he had any contempt and arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best to hide in the crypt outside the city." Fernando said calmly. then. His gaze shifted to the table. There was an unadorned belt there, and suddenly he became angry again. "Roland, why should I wear this belt to see Count Pefus? Is it interesting to become a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland bowed his head and avoided laughing Leaking, it took a while to look up, "seriously" authentic: "You are a young high-ranking magician, the hope of the empire, and killed the cardinal, has long been targeted by the 'black claw dog', Become a member of the purification sequence, how can Count Pefus recognize you? When he repents, maybe there will be a cardinal or an epic knight, but now it is better, he can't figure out who we are. As long as the strength and position are revealed, it is more conducive to cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is ok to change the appearance directly with the change spells!" Fernando is not deceived at all. Only the bright red eyes seem to be full of storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland subconsciously took a step back: "But even sex has changed, isn’t it easier to recognize it? And, moreover, your temper is bad, your mouth is poisonous As a man, it is easy to anger the Earl of Pephos, and if you change to a beautiful lady, you will use communication and negotiation more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't lack female magician Fernando accepted this explanation a bit and muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spread the stalls: "But they are not high-level, easy to be caught, and then, when I proposed, you did not object, even the explanation Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to have come to the interest, curiously asked: "What is the feeling of becoming a lady? Is it being looked at by the wolf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feeling? Very strange It’s also a pleasure to see other people’s idiots, but this belt is still not perfect. The situation after the change is false. You can’t really experience the lady’s physical feelings...” Fernando seems to think about magic research. "I have to find a way to refine a perfect..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he looked at Roland and saw his friend stunned, only for a long time to spit out a word: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pervert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Fernando snorted and the pressure around him swelled high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Haha laughed twice: "Just kidding, yes, Fernando, the day after tomorrow we have to rush to Padre Harbour, there is a magician secret from across the strait By boat, it’s a sergeant!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“**师?” Fernando was slightly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, a fairly young sergeant, this is a great complement to our strength!" Roland said excitedly, "if not Carlos." I have dealt with him across the strait. We have no way to contact him. Other magic organizations will definitely come and win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been split into three The kingdom, a duchy, and the northern coastal corridors of the city, the past magical empire was broken up, there have been many magical organizations, including long-standing super-large organizations, such as "Parmela's cabin", also has a newly established Small organizations, such as Fernando’s “Sorcerer Union”, have in common that they can only hide in the dark corners and struggle for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando nodded lightly: "A faculty member who knows the nine-ring spell can really help us truly unite with other organizations."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their organization is called "Sorcerer Union", which is to unite the major magic organizations to fight against the church. If they are not strong enough, they can't convince other organizations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed deeply: "Yeah, the legendary lords can hide in their own half-face, hide and close the entrance, and escape into the dark mountains." And we can only work hard to survive, a ** teacher is the most important weight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't say that, if not legend You have drawn the attention of the cardinal and the epic knight, and we may have been annihilated.” Fernando rarely described the legendary magicians as mice in the gutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland once again sighed: "There are also the existence of important cities such as Aalto. It is said that most of the strengths of the truth cults are placed on top of them, um, There are quite a few legendary lords gathered there, though not all, but most of them. It seems that the glory of the empire has not disappeared with the fall of Antiefler, but it has re-emerged cohesion, oh, if not in the past So many legendary lords are missing, the truth cults are not developing at all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is already a fact, don't regret and regret, look at the present and the future!" Fernando Roughly interrupted Roland's words, "What is the sorcerer's name? How old is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously compares himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head: "I don't know, it won't be too small anyway. Which one can be a few hundred years old?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not have it in the future!" Fernando proudly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was born after the sacred calendar, the Twilight War was still anxious, and most of the strait was still under the control of two magical empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland once again held back the smile: "Yes, he is Derek Douglas, and we are in exile because of the fall of Antiefler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Derrick Douglas." Fernando repeated it, remembering the name as the object of future comparisons, "Why doesn't he fly directly?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
