			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of the Flower Month, the Silvermoon Song League is in the Allinge Division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian is dressed as a war mage, with six silver stars in the chest, five black ring magic badges, and one inlaid The silver-white crescent moon badge slowly entered the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Yurisian." Several mid-level arcans who came down the stairs saw Urisian and greeted him with respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although after the influence factor comes out, the level of the arcane level exceeds the magic level is not rare, but the high-level arcane division is still rare, five to six It seems to be the obstacle that many people will never have in their lifetime. Yuris Ann relied on the discovery of spectral splitting in a strong magnetic field four months ago and gave a theoretical explanation, confirming the prediction of the new alchemy, and finally had six silver stars, if not for the semi-substantialization of the cognitive world. At some distance, he will be promoted to the sixth ring and become a high-rank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian has always been more accommodating when he is not carrying out his tasks. He said with a smile: "Good morning, are you waiting for today's "Arcane"?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this debate about Oliver’s transformation of the equations has been fierce, and we can’t wait to see the latest explanations, the latest applications, maybe Mr. Bit has been confirmed by experiments?” The leading middle-level Arcanist Bobby is a burly man with two eyes that are slightly narrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uris Anhe smiled and said: "I am also, but I am more worried about seeing Evans' papers on this topic some day."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, a lot of arcane masters in the hall suddenly silenced, the name entangled them like a nightmare, and he did not comment on the transformation equations. They did not dare to believe too much in the essays of Lord Oliver and many of them. Waiting and fear seem to have become a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Bobby returned to God, just to answer Ulysian’s words, suddenly saw several magic apprentices in charge of reception. The journals such as "Arcane" and "Magic" were brought out and placed on the reception desk. Then they changed their minds: "Mr. Yurisian, the paper is here, please ask first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;See Bobby at the front of the reception desk. Yuris Ann shook his head and joked: "According to the order, you should first check if there is any Evans paper to remind everyone to pay attention."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was euphemistically and humorously rejecting Bobby’s kindness, but when the words were exported, the arcane masters who were rushing to buy the journals all stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their eyes focused on Bobby’s face, as if they were in agreement with Ulysian’s opinion, did you first turn over and have Lucien? Evans's paper, if so, what is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobby, who didn’t think so much, was watched with so many eyes, and suddenly remembered the "headshot" and "crushed" "The cold sweat of the forehead quickly secreted, but the pressure that the Arcanist gave him was so great that he made a difficult choice and then reached for an "Arcane." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian sees his jokes seem to be magnified in a particular environment, so go one step ahead and prepare to stop Bobby, or "identify" yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard Bobby blurt out: "There is Mr. Evans's paper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound Uncontrollably sorghum, you can feel the obvious tremor, and there is a little bit of whispering in the hall before it disappears, as if it was solidified by time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What paper?" Ulysses asked subconsciously. Bobby sighed: "The electrokinetics of the moving object, the equation of mass energy, sounds like a study of the theory of the movement of the electromagnetic system. It is not like subverting the surname. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's relax, curious, he immediately looked at the first paper in the journal at the reception desk, and the rest of the arcanes were thoughtful Actually, he did not interrupt him, his eyes condensed on his head, and Ulysian fell into thinking because the meaning contained in this topic was unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Bobby’s facial muscles began to distort, and a drop of sweat on his forehead condensed, sliding down his face, then his left hand stretched out and held his head. It seems extremely painful, my eyes are confused and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guys?" Bobby asked in a very puzzled way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists looked at him with strange eyes, and Yuris Ann coughed and said: "We saw you very painful before, so I want to give you a Quiet environment, what is this paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, are you worried about my cognitive breakdown, head explosion?" Bobby wakes up , smiled and said: "How come? Mr. Evans's paper is based on two premise assumptions, naturally derived the transformation equations of Lord Oliver, there is no subversive content."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention okay, Yurisian and others have retired three steps: "What? Is it a paper explaining the Oliver transformation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Why are you so painful, and still hold your head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby looked down at his feet with embarrassment: "I’m still deducing the formula inside. I can understand it, but I have a very confused description of time, space, quality, and energy. I can’t figure out how to think, hate. Knock on your head and see if you can get some inspiration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, almost the same time the exhalation sounds into a breeze, it turned out that this guy can't understand, I tried hard to think there, scared myself and waited for a jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing that "Evans explained" after "waiting for" for a long time, the group of middle and low-level arcane masters in the Song of the Silver Moon League Finally landed, but no one dares to go to read carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, thinking of Bobby is fine, Yuris Ann took the courage to walk to the reception desk and looked at Lucian’s thesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is slowly passing, the expression on Urisian’s face is getting more and more dignified, the muscles are tight, the teeth are gnashing, the smooth forehead is full of cold sweat, eyes Full of doubts and confusion, the mouth whispered constantly, seemingly chanting space and time, quality and energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the most amazing thing is that there seems to be an inexplicable change in his side, like the light becomes brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Urisian’s performance, Bobby immediately understood their previous fears, magical fluctuations, acceleration stacking, three steps and two steps. Into the crowd, and the arcane masters clenched each other with a fist, staring at Yurisian's head with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Yurisian suddenly screamed, and these tight arcane men immediately hurried back, in the hall. In a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they each hid farther and prepared to see a headless body, they found that Ulysse was full of energy and smiled. There. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Yurisian, are you okay?" Bobby asked with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uris Anhalha laughed, and the voice was full of emotions: "This paper, although not perfect, gave me great shock and solved it. Some problems that have been bothering me for a long time, so I just realized that the world is semi-substantial!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his early mental power and control over magic, This means that he is about to become a six-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Then congratulate you in advance to become a high-ranking mage. But, Mr. Yurisian, why are you screaming? We think that your head is going to be Exploded..." Bobby said frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uris Anhe smiled and said: "I am very happy, so I want you to share my happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; witnessed that Ulysian stepped through the biggest obstacle to the high level, the middle-level arcans in the hall refused to condemn his mischief, and flocked to the front desk to buy the "Arcane" journal. I hope that I can have a similar "miracle" on my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, only a few of the dozens of middle-level arcane divisions were stunned, as if they were a bit harvested and a bit stunned, others Like Bobby, I can understand the derivation, but I don't understand the specific meaning and I am puzzled. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they all noticed that this paper seems to overthrow the Douglas Speaker’s movement system, and the cognitive world built on this foundation has been shaken, fortunately Sean spent a lot of effort behind the paper to describe the past movement system is a low-speed approximation of this theory, and gave many examples to stabilize them. This is not overthrowing, but sublimation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
