			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha took a close look at the blue light from the distance, a rounded hollow on one side, and a dark and depressed dark sea on the other. The quirky deep-sea "monsters" are clearly separated and there is no mixed place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The part of the sea seems to have been squeezed out by the special door of the 'blue door, and there is not even a little air inside. If you want to get through the Hells Sensing is very difficult." She made her own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original master of Lucien’s mastery of magical magic, it’s easy to dive into the vicinity of the “Blue Gate” without attention, but according to The news of Liss and the former priest, Hells was in front of the "Blue Gate", with the strength of his legendary peak and the intuitive sense of matching it, in the absence of sea water, fish, sea monsters, microbes and deep-sea plants. It is a difficult thing to quietly approach the reality in the case of cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently daggers, once again looked at the nearby environment, the body is heavy, sinking to the bottom of the sea, stepping on the rich "ground" of various minerals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here, I will dive in and see." Lucien had an idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not hesitate and nodded slightly: "Well, if something happens, I will fly over immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very clear about her ability to detect and covert sneak, and she has an unimaginable gap with the legendary magician. The magic that is beyond the scope of understanding is the most suitable choice at this time, so If you forcefully ask to go, you will drag Lu Xien when you encounter any unexpected situation, for example, he must cast two spells to cover up the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not that the magician’s ability to covert sneak attacks and secret investigations must be stronger than the Cavaliers, but the blood of the sword of truth. Can't do such a fine thing, other special blood vessels that are good at this may not be worse than magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Natasha agree, Lucien smiles to stimulate the spell model in the soul, the reason why she likes her, I am afraid that she is not dragging the water, Get things clear and prioritize. Know how to weigh the pros and cons, not too serious emotional use, but will not give up their most basic beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of faint yellow-brown radiance rises in Lucien's body, enveloping him all over the body and magical fluctuations with the help of super magic skills, slightly Hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the yellow-brown light, Lucien’s body suddenly softened, and all the items including the “Robe of the Great Arcanist” became a body with the body. Beach mud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ooze?" In the soul connection, Natasha’s slightly confused voice came, she had never seen this strange spell, only the most Guess in the direction of the approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's soft mud-like body squirming and blending with the seabed land. Spiritual power seems to have become a myriad of tentacles, constantly extending in all directions, forming a “Mental Power Network”·Incorporate the nearby land into its own control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, a rare nine-ring magic", the master of the earth, "the blue door, just crowded the sea, did not let the seabed deep, so just send it It’s useful.” Lucien explained to Natasha, “It’s always 'under the ground, no matter what.’”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn’t ask again, tight Holding the "Sword of Truth" and preparing for the raid, Lu Xien went deeper into the ground and then quietly sneaked into the "Blue Gate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the ground is more oppressive than the darkness of the deep sea. People feel that they will be buried here at any time, although Lucien can extend to the ground. The spiritual tentacles perceive the situation in the vicinity, and there is confusion in time and space. I don’t know the illusion of what year it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three hundred kilometers, the main star of the destiny in the soul of Lu Xien suddenly moved, and the spiritual power extended to the ground suddenly recovered. The trend also came to an abrupt end, and the whole person quietly nestled in the ground in a strange state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t move forward, the front is the “absolute defense” range of “The Endless Ocean Lord” Hells! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "absolute defense" scope is the surrounding range of a legendary peak that is almost absolutely controlled. According to personal strength, it is good at different. There are big and small, but no The one exception is that no one can sneak into this range without causing them to be alert, even if they are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien’s tentacle-like mental strength has been retracted a lot, there is a long distance from the ground, but there are always many small holes between the sand and the rock, which are equivalent to the “owner of the earth”. Eyes, let Lucien be able to "see" the situation outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place not too far away, there is a magnificent palace, no walls, a palace completely supported by huge stone pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palace is not comparable to the grandeur of the Temple of the Dead, but is equivalent to a Nexus Palace, and the stone columns are mottled and ancient, from time to time can see the break and The traces of the collapse are like the ancient cities that were submerged at the bottom by the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This palace is ring-shaped, the center is an open altar, and above the altar is a blue door that has nothing to do. This door makes Lucien feel The familiarity of the same, because it is the same as the "! Lingxiao fireplace", it is far away from the sky, but it is far away in front of the sky. It seems to touch the touch forever and cannot get close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit like...························································································ There are some similarities in the sense of human beings, and it is also consistent with the “deity of glory” that is variable and high above. “Perhaps this is the different embodiment of the world, so it gives a similar feeling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Blue Gate is not in harmony with the altar and the palace. It does not feel the traces of time, and the altars and palaces are engraved with the mottled of the years. The immortal chamber and the immortal martyrdom, the soul fireplace and the Temple of the Necessity seem to match much..." Lucien identified the anomaly of the environment and made a preliminary reasoning, "should be the discovery of the blue door, after, a certain Controlling the construction of the sea-strongers here to set off the position of the 'blue door,' but the latecomers don't pay much attention to this extra thing, so they will have this feeling of desolate and old. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar is a lot better than the palace that is full of broken walls, and there are some new ones near the blue door and the eight sides of the altar." The strange and strange symbols, even the famous arcane masters of Lucien, have some point to distinguish what is the text, only think that each three-dimensional symbol and pattern is simple and vicissitudes, as if it contains endless mysteries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the words that Helks and others control the 'Blue Gate', the strong ones created according to the 'Blue Gate', which are similar to the 'Dark Words'? Lucien guessed the reason, but no matter what, the influence of these basic "extraordinary words" on the surrounding environment exposed their role, allowing Lucien to slowly analyze the meaning of each text and the effect of the entire magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eight sides of the altar, there is a lot of sea elves, gypsy fishermen and more in the bloody magical array that is familiar to Sean. The squid, the mutated hippocampus, the poisonous jellyfish and the deep sea Yalong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is noticed here, the blood sacrifice magic array has started. These poor creatures have completely lost their lives and corpses, and they are surrounded by a rich blood and milky light, filled with pain, hatred and despair as a real emotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the altar, in front of the blue door, standing two strange creatures, one is a tall fisherman, so full of frost giants, the scales are no longer silver gray, no blood Light is a dark blue color like a gem He wears a blue crown and blocks the upper half of his face in a strange shadow. Only a pair of deep red indifferent eyes are revealed and the lower half of the face The hard lips are impressive, and his limbs are not as shrinking as other fish, but a strong and powerful right hand clasps a gold trident, under the trident, a blue-eyed gemstone belt A faint sense of time and space fluctuations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Lord of Endless Oceans", the Emperor of the Turtles, Heilx.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His side is a more eccentric creature, the whole body seems to be made of transparent soft material, constantly twisting and wandering like a flower bloom, sometimes like a tentacle spread at the same time, this creature The face has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, like a transparent film bag filled with water.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seven sea generals rank second 'Dark jellyfish,? Lucien thought to himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herkes looked around the blood sacrifice magical squad, and the voice was like a golden stone singer: "When we open the blue door You can get the gift of the sea, I will restore the strongest state, and you can get the legendary material that is not worse than the blue key. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
