			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in the late month of June (June) is already very hot. Joanna and Betty on both sides of the carriage are sweating, like The stream ran through the face, and the clothes on their back seemed to be soaked, but there was no visible trace under the cover of the leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the two women who look slim and white because of the elves’ bloodlines have no complaints, and they are firmly guarded on both sides of the carriage. As for the Simon in front, Repelling a few beasts rushing down the hill, and letting the road car occasionally pause from the parsing of magic, Lucian couldn’t help but nod. They are the best local adventurers recommended by the pub owner Hansen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the real man who has been bragging about his past adventures and training achievements from time to time. Chris has become like a frosted eggplant, and he is very hot. I don't want to say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, because Lu Xien has been closing his eyes, Lina is quiet, but only occasionally crying children, Bert? Wise couldn't find the object when he wanted to talk a few times. He could only helplessly take the score from his suitcase and watch it quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed quickly, and the sky gradually darkened. At about 7 o'clock in the evening, after obtaining the consent of Lucien, Simon chose a leeward mountain wall depression to camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the efforts of the three adventurers, three tents were built with the horse carriage as the core, one for three ladies, one for Simon and the coachman. One is a single Wise, and Lucien sleeps in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling and watching the three adventurers keep busy, the roadside leisurely roadside is thankful for the money, if you want to travel alone, most Ok, wait until you become a middle-level magician, and learn the "magician's hut" after the three-ring magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the campfire, set up the jar, cook the food, Simon and other three adventurers are only a little idle, the two ladies go to the next stream to clean up, he Sit next to the carriage and chat with Lucien and Wise about the black magician and vampire legends in the south-central part of the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that in the dark ages, it was indeed the territory of a black magician, but later he was completely purified by the church." Lucian recalled A historical book read in the Labasa Natasha study room, "I don't think there are so many legends left now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon is more talkative than his appearance. Hehe smiled: "The more mysterious things, the more people are willing to understand and spread. And at night, they can scare children who are not willing to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Every town has a church, but most of the poor like to scare themselves." Wise dismissed the legend of the black magician and the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, the two ladies slowly walked back, the linen hair they had just washed on their shoulders, the wetness was slightly messy, with a touch of light Temptation, but Betty, a 16-year-old half-elf who hasn’t opened up yet, has no style like her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle sounded violently, full of laughter, the two bards from the camp not far away, Chris, the stout man and them Made a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bards simply picked up the seven-stringed harp and bounced a warm and romantic song, staring at the two ladies. This is the instinct of the bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna was used to this kind of scene, smiled and sat down next to her husband Simon, stirring the wild vegetable soup and bread cooked in the jar. Betty, the little girl, seemed a bit unsatisfied, and looked at her face with shame and anger. The result was a more intense sound of the piano, and even another bard joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'd better be quiet." Simon screamed to warn the two bards, and if he didn't accept the hiring task, he would now pull the sword away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick and tall arm of Simon is very powerful, even if the two bards themselves have good strength, after measuring it, they choose to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris said: "Simon, my friends singing and playing the piano is their own thing, why do you make them quiet? Have me Chris Here, you are absolutely not allowed to bully people with strength." He said that he was shaking his muscles and showing off the two-handed sword that was taller than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien watched the fascinating and beautiful show of the beautiful woman, and forgot to talk. Betty snorted: "Because they are too hard to play, they are quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unpleasant? Little girl, you feel like you are playing better than us. Ok?" The first bard's face sank, even if it was a beautiful woman, she couldn't be so proud of her proud ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty just exported under anger, and was suddenly dumb after being attacked by the other party, but the little girl refused to accept the loss, looked left and right, suddenly saw Wise, remembered him Going to study music in Coser City, I couldn’t help but point to him: “Mr. Wise on our side is a hundred times better than you!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, she realized that Wise was one of the employers, how could he be involved, so he used his eyes to sigh with Wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise warmly nodded and said that he understood her impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bard over there looked at Wise with a funny smile: "He? Can an ordinary traveler play better than my bard?" If he can do this, then I immediately apologize to the little girl, and you will no longer play the piano when you meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise does not answer the question, just with the road Sean looked at the quarrel as calmly and funnyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wise seems to dare not come forward, the bard and Chris sneered out loudly, letting Betty be red-faced, crappy and gazing Wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon turned his head and asked Lu Xien with his gaze. After Lu Xien nodded his promise, he would pull out the sword behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Wise stood up and smiled lightly: "I just started on the music road, but no man can refuse the prayer of a beautiful lady." I had to try it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, don't mess with the little girl, Mr. Wise." The bard was mercilessly big. laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise walked back to the tent, took the harp from the suitcase, and then said nothing, it was just playing by the bard. The first one was pleasing to the eye and full of emotions. Every detail was handled at a very high level, and I didn’t know much better than the bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet, the music ended, Betty first raised his hand, looked at Wise with admiration, and proudly looked at the bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet's face is ugly, how can I just pull a person to have the level of a musician, has the Lord abandoned himself and made himself infected with bad luck? I don’t want to be so reluctant to know it, or transfer the topic to another young person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, beautiful lady." He apologized abruptly, then returned to Chris, who seemed to be sullen, and cooked the food silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty here is elated, and Simon and Joanna are also enthusiastic about Wise, who has helped her sister and music talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Wise, can play Mr. Evans, huh, I am talking about the talented musician Lucien Evans adapted from the D major Cannon? The harp version is also very good." Betty apologetically looked at Sean, and then eagerly begged Wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise smiled lightly, nodded lightly, and bounced the D major Canon, and the familiar melodious music sounded, letting Lucien recall the Aalto. My friends, I was filled with emotions: "When the city of Koser is waiting, they will send a letter to John and Natasha through the Musicians Association to talk about the journey of the two months."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the central and southern parts of the continent, Lucien once sent it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing the D major Kanon, the dinner has been cooked, Betty is passionate and unrestrained: "Mr. Wise, if not I have fallen in love with Lucien? Mr. Evans The music will definitely love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think some musicians in Coser City don't have Mr. Wise you play well." Joanna followed. praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise's smile has become a little thicker, able to be in the mouth of Betty and Lucien? Evans is comparable, he is inevitably a little proud, but the famous musician who is known as a beginning of the era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
