			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Wicken’s heart smirked, the light and shadow, the distorted body diffused and disintegrated into two worlds of overlapping light and darkness. A fallen evil, dark shadows, painful and desperate, a noble sacred, angelic song, beautiful and dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnants of the ancient hell and the reappearance of the paradise mountain constitute the balance of the previous shock, allowing Wicken to briefly regain possession of the world that does not belong to this world. feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change shows that Viken completely gave up on himself, preferring to completely retreat and fall and find a chance to give Lucien a fatal blow, let him be like a dead spirit Like the mysterious existence, it can only be "returned" after tens of millions of years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is close to the feeling that Lucien gives at this time, as if he is in the same world as He who is disappearing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken grasped the breath of Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, He found that the time and space around him became dark and deep, and the stars of the distant sky were all around, and the edge of the distant space shriveled, symbolizing The force of the electromagnetic wind has become a period of time, it seems to be constantly changing what, and below it is a different color element similar to the planet, the electrons surround the nucleus, diffuse into a cloud, and the top is a huge fireball . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lucien’s “cognitive world”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can actually break into his "cognitive world"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s the state of me and his present state that is similar to the state of “cognitive world”. It seems that this world does not belong to this world, with some kind of Forms are connected to this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken’s thoughts rolled over and probably understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, He is also very clear. The state of itself and Lucien at this time is still quite different from the "cognitive world". The reason why it can come in is obviously because Lucien deliberately adjusted the state of "cognitive world". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does He want to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, since He let me in, then I completely destroy his cognitive world, which is even harder to recover and return! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken’s myriad ideas flashed between the electric and the flint, and in a moment I made up my mind that “Ancient Hell” and “Heavenly Mountain” began to expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly. He saw Lucien in the distant "Starry Sky" once again revealing a gentle and elegant smile, and the huge fireball on his head turned to the back and turned to a thick black back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of darkness that can't be seen through the light exudes unimaginable suction, illusory invisible and horrible suction, and will instantly include "Ancient Hell" and Viken, including "Paradise Mountain", sucked in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal starry sky, one of the main stars of Lucien’s destiny is that it cannot effectively influence the material world, but at this time. The state of Viken is in sync with the "cognitive world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the suction of all this, the expansion of "Ancient Hell" and "Heavenly Mountain" was pulled, and Wicken’s screams were too late to be issued. Was inhaled into this darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien did not relax, the expression of smile became dignified, the cognitive world quickly faded, and the perspective of the universe behind the shadows changed. From the huge fireball, the azure planet to a darkness that doesn't know what it looks like, it seems to be in the darkness of rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This darkness is more horrible than the darkness in Lucian’s “cognitive world”, even though the universe is also alive, Douglas, Maldives and other gods are aware of it. Easily shred the power of yourself and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the darkness in the "cognitive world" has a very small "communication" with this "darkness"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the stars in Lucien’s “cognitive world” are constantly being inhaled “black”, everything becomes swaying, but “black” The things also entered the "darkness" along the "channel of communication." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent scream came out, and Lu Xien quickly interrupted the contact and turned the darkness to the rear. Let the fireball be re-rendered, even though everything he did was so perfect, the "cognitive world" was already in the air, which made his figure slightly bleak and not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken is completely over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Mardi Moss is quite empathetic, and now Lucien is too strong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, he had the idea of ​​helping Viken to escape to maintain the balance of the situation. But Douglas and "Silver Moon" have not relaxed their vigilance against themselves, so they can only choose to surrender in the future...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosmic virtual shadow, cognitive world The projection slowly disappeared and Lucien’s body quickly solidified. They are beheaded against Douglas, ‘Silver Moon’ Etna, Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky and the sky dissipated, and the bright sunshine sprinkled on him, dyed a golden color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aringe, in Rentat, although no one has long cared about this battle, there are still many people muttering to themselves: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheat your...cheat your..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, "Atomic Universe", "Babel Tower". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just came out of the lab and saw Natasha holding a red wine glass in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows and looking out at the starry sky outside the main material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a way to restore Mr. Muskilllin's situation?" Natasha asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and shook his head again: "There is a certain gain, but it will take some time to explore, even if I am a god, it is not a panacea. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuken merged with "Paradise Mountain", and the blazing angels such as Maskillin who were able to break away were hiding in the "door world", after all, they Unlike the ancient devil, it is closely linked to "Ancient Hell." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Class-like God..." Natasha licked her teeth and expressed her heartfelt effort. "What do you say about the high-dimensional soul?" Is He himself conscious? Can he control the corresponding soul projection?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very interested in this model of Lucien, although most do not understand, but After all, she can understand the key to her own advancement. However, she also has concerns and concerns. She fears that her high-dimensional soul essence can control herself. When she thinks she will be controlled by unknown mysterious things, her heart is not comfortable. I want to get rid of the other person, even if it is another "self". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, if I can fully understand the nature and state of the high-dimensional soul, I am already a 'true god', and now I can only pass the current phenomenon and me. After the genie, he made some guesses about its touch. For example, he is likely to be in a chaotic state. After projecting into each parallel universe, combining with matter, it produces a distinct and unique consciousness, so after death, memory and way of thinking Will disappear, because they do not belong to the essence of the high-dimensional soul." Lucien said that he is not too sure of the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Combined with matter will produce consciousness? Can the soul be independent of the flesh, like a ghost?" Natasha looks like a eager to learn the Arcanist . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "The soul I usually call. More is the body, the body made up of special isotopes and electromagnetic fields of certain elements. It is also a matter, at least I think that in a universe like ours, the projection of a high-dimensional soul must depend on matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Mo licks his chin : "That 'destiny of the starry sky'? This is no material, and why the real planet will show our destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You yourself Answered my own question." Lucien laughed and took the champagne that Natasha poured for herself. "By following the 'connection' of the projection of the high-dimensional soul and the material world, we can grasp all the traces of this soul in the material world. The principle is the same as that of 'God Drop', except that it is used for destruction, but in a high-dimensional state. All traces of all life should be overlapping or entangled. This is the 'real appearance' of the destiny of the starry sky. So, one side has changed and the other can detect it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
