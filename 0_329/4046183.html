			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corrosion water polo and Yang Yan body body disappeared together, Lucien subconsciously inspired the soul model inside the soul, two silver-black magic missiles paddling wonderful The arc hit the fisherman holding the coral rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lucien turned into a residual shadow and flew to the side, trying to rely on the speed of the Cavaliers to avoid the subsequent lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two magical missiles hit the body of this strange fishman, but an invisible vortex emerged around his body, and Lucien’s magic missile Devouring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Ring Magic "Resist Energy Damage"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can absorb a specified type of energy that does not exceed the limit. It turned out to be really a fisherman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While resisting Lucian’s magical missile, the fishman’s mage took a coral stick and slumbered in the narrow cabin. Refer to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart suddenly burst into a crazy smile, and the whole body trembled and laughed: “Ha ha ha, ha ha ha.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you keep running, it seems that you can't get rid of the spiritual lock of the second-ring caster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unspeakable laughter, Lucien’s spirit is scattered, whether it is to cast magic or to inspire magical items, it’s hard to do so, even with both hands and feet. I started to laugh weakly, and running and dodging gradually slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfied Lu Xien was very anxious and understood that he was in the second ring magic "Tanos's laughter feast", in an extremely dangerous In the situation, you must avoid it immediately, otherwise the attack of the fisherman's mage will have his own surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand of the "Ice and Snow Vengeance" ring has been shining with crystal cold, bringing the touch of Lucien to the cold, so that he can maintain the most basic reaction in the laughter . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of his own soul, will and spirit, Lucien finally restrained the laughter slightly, rolled on the spot, and hurriedly sneaked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smashing lightning ball flies straight down the fisherman's coral rod, passing through a tiny silver-white electric snake, and then slamming I hit the place where Lu Xien stood and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The massive lightning explosion, the cabin where the apprentices lived before turned into pieces of wood, a group of burnt black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the road Lucy rolled away, it was affected by the lightning, the back was numb, the body was stiff, and the hair was erected, and almost could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the tremor brought by this electric shock also allowed Lucien to recover from the laughter, the flamer’s bracelet lit up, and the hot and horrible fireball was directed to the fisherman. And go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien has a mind to consider whether there will be unresolved traces of fireballs. The first thing to do is to be in this fisherman. The mage keeps his life on his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fireball whistling and whistling, the surrounding air is distorted by high temperature, but the fishman’s mage is not flustered, and his body suddenly separates a person who is exactly the same as himself. Holding the coral staff, the silver ash hole is cold and ruthless, and the whole body scales are bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball hit the original fishman mage is like hitting a mirror, exploding, the flame is splashing everywhere, its crack is broken, disappears without trace. The fisherman next to him is in perfect condition because of the magic bubble and the huge blisters that appear on the scales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's strongest attack magic three-ring fireball technique is so easily cracked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fisherman’s mage uses only the two-ring magic “mirror shadow”, which creates different numbers of avatars depending on their level of spellcasting. Help the ontology to get rid of the lock, it can't hurt the ontology before cracking or destroying the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No low-level magic, only magicians who won't use it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of whether there is a way to get rid of the lock in the case of mental suppression, Lucian will not let go of a glimmer of hope. At the same time, the soul-in-law model stimulates a black shadow that seems to be composed of fear to the fishman mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic "frightening". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only let the fishman mage fall into a negative state such as panic, unable to cast spells, and have the opportunity to attack or escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow flutters the fishman mage, but the fishman mage is like watching it all, the silver-gray eyes are cold and ruthless, there is no fear of a little bit of fear, as if Completely unaffected by "frightening". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His silver flashes in the pupils, Lucien’s eyes appear an unusually complex light blue pattern, it is so mysterious and profound, will Lucien’s The eyes are completely attracted. It seems that all the spirits and minds have been put into it, and the whole person has become embarrassed and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the "star of destiny" suddenly shines, as if urging Lucien, telling him that danger is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected by this, coupled with the left-handed "Avenue of the Snow", Lucien was in a chill, slightly awake, and did not hesitate to stir up the firefighter The bracelet, Yang Yan protects the body into a stream of fire eruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was influenced by the second-ring magic "hypnosis totem" of the fisherman's mage, and almost died quietly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge water droplet filled with deep blue water enveloped Lucien, and the waves kept pressing against Lucien, extinguishing the body. The flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Ring Magic "溺毙水泡"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames and blisters disappeared at the same time, Lucian slammed down to the side, because another lightning bolt flashing with countless silver and white lights flew over and exploded. The board was split and black, and the smoke was black. The road was numb and the clothes were black and ruptured. After the fall, it almost never climbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to hold away and turn into the afterimage. Lucien’s heart is full of deep frustration, since the experience of combat, except The time when the gangs were beaten, there was never a fight that was completely suppressed as it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical magic of the fisherman’s mage is endless, showing the magician’s means and strength to the fullest. Lucien knows how much he can beat Hunt. Fortunately, if it is not his failure to transform the ritual, there is not much reason. With his strength and intelligence of the Necromancer who is close to the Third Ring, he may have become a corpse for his experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many low-level wizards who rely on powerful magic items to kill high-level, two-level, or even three-level magician opponents, but more The situation is that the opponent has escaped the attack through various magical magic, and then slowly kills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the magician, sometimes the choice of a spell may represent the end of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic that affects the state of mind is useless. It seems to cast a second-ring magic of 'mechanized mind' on oneself, which can immunize the negative state of all minds. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanized mind is to let emotional creatures produce mechanical surnames, like various magic images, thus immunizing "sleep", "frightening" and other effects The magic of the state of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fisherman's defense against energy attacks is very important, and fireball can't be locked. Do you want me to crack the spell with him? I haven't started learning yet." Ring magic, lacking a lot of magical means, even if you try to crack, it doesn't have much effect. And now, the opponent's only magic that affects the state and an attacking magic can completely kill me, and there is no ability to dodge and defend." < br br br br br br br br This is the only, small hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a terrible experience to fight a magician above his spellcasting level. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after two offensives that you came to me, Lucien judged that the rescued knights should arrive, and then they would not have to escape without fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
