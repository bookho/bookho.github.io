			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not wear a gorgeous and noble court dress today, but a simple white knight dress, the slender legs were completely revealed, it should be just Practice the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a funny smile and wanted to talk to Lucien about the gentleman’s topic, but after feeling the solemnity of Lucien, it immediately converges. Smile, very serious and serious question: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very different from her usual lazy and casual jokes, like a ready-to-go Go out and kill the prey of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer directly, but looked at Camille and looked at the other corner of the piano room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is not a stupid person. On the contrary, she is very clever. When she looks at Lucien’s performance, she understands his plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If even Aunt Camille can't trust, then I have already died, and others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice, Camille stood up, the blue eyes bloomed brightly, and the whole person also showed the same dark blue, and the whole person became like a statue condensed with sea water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Camille’s body turned into a blue sea, flowing on the ground of the piano room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is getting more and more, the water surface is getting higher and higher, and it quickly flooded the chest from Lucien’s ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucine’s confused eyes, Natasha solemnly nodded and motioned him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seawater continues to rise, completely drowning the entire piano room, and the blue waves are faint, like coming to the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seawater did not flow out of the piano room, and Lucien’s breathing was normal, and it was easy to enjoy the air that was originally indistinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the meticulous encirclement of the sea of ​​Camille, Lucien felt that the "moonlight" blood in his body could not help but illuminate the surface of the skin. The layer of silver shines, while the opposite Natasha has nothing to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha sees it, the right eyebrow is used to pick the name: "Knight power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And she sincerely apologized: "Sorry, Lucien, I don't know that Amir Camille will deliberately oppress to check your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the card Ms. Mill’s duties, I understand very well, you don’t have to apologize for your Royal Highness.” Since Lucien was ready to tell Natasha about some of the things, he was ready to be inspected, so on Tuesday, in addition to testing the “silver The cult of the cult is also waiting for the power of the princess. It is also waiting for the stimulation of the blood force. Otherwise, it is likely to be the identity of the magic apprentice. If it is impossible to stimulate the blood, it will have to be more tortuous and more indirect. Also worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how "the kidnappers" can't emphasize "alarm" and show off their strength and control, there is no doubt that the best option is to do things. Tell Natasha that only their strength can deal with the high level of the cult. Otherwise, Luisen’s own strength, in front of the cult seniors who are likely to have the cardinal level, even if there is higher wisdom, it is doomed to death and failure. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is to choose a good time and not let their actions threaten the hostages and their own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at the layer of silver frost, his right hand holding his right elbow, his right thumb and forefinger touching his bright and beautiful but slightly stiff chin. Doubtful: "The moonlight is just weaker than the official knight... Lucien, can you tell me what is going on now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi I said what I thought long ago: "As you can see, my knight power is not from myself, but from others. Since the concert that night, I have received your invitation from His Royal Highness to be yours. When the music consultant started, I was involved in a conspiracy against you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha's mouth micro-hook: "So they exchanged pseudo-knight power for you. Commitment?" A similar approach, the Violet family also has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I let the intelligence department..." Natasha's mouth moved, then she looked up gently and looked at the ripples around her: "Aunt Camille, the people who come to work around me should be investigated." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Her Royal Highness. We got information from the church referee. Although Mr. Evans had contacted the witch, he did not have any traces of learning magic. This is the referee. Affirmation, I believe in their professional ability, and the intelligence department has secretly investigated Mr. Evans’s friends, there is no problem.” Camille has stopped checking Lu Xi’an’s body, and the voice seems to be from all directions. Come, with the tides screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard the words of Camille, only to know that he can successfully become a music consultant for Natasha is not so simple and easy on the surface, but this is very Normal, Natasha is the future female grandfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded and asked directly: "What about the kidnapped Mr. Joel?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the report given by the intelligence department, Mr. Joel was invited by Lord Dick from Lombard County. Their evaluation is 'very normal'." Camille’s voice is rare. anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien interjected: "Not only that, on Tuesday, I deliberately showed nervousness and uneasiness in front of you, Princess Royal, let you notice, and the result is evening. They know this. I think that the people around you are very problematic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is very serious, but soon shakes her head again It was up: "Lu Xien, it turned out that your nervousness and uneasiness were pretending to be, and you really despised your calmness and control over yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then She walked a few steps in the piano room that was submerged by the sea with her hands: "On Tuesday, except for Aunt Camille, there are no more than ten people, but because it is not important, they are likely to be a joke. Telling the people around you, but to investigate carefully, the intelligence department is not trustworthy, Camille Auntie, you go directly to the church to find the two cardinals of Amorton and Gossett to help."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal of Sald has long lived in semi-hidden Live the Church in Waoulite Duchy of things mainly by two cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Natasha asked about the contact with Lucy in the past few days, and Lucien will include himself to find the Philippines. Lisi bought Moonlight Rose, and most of the things that were prepared to inspire the blood of the John Knights were spoken. Of course, apart from the temptations of the cultists involved in magical power, and already knowing that the other party is the "Silver White Horn" organization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I think you should be followed by a kidnapper for a long time." Natasha easily judged by Lucian’s narrative. This, but I don't know which party it belongs to. "Aunt Camille, you are looking for an opportunity to catch the kidnapper and torture it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi Enthusiastically said: "His Royal Highness, don't be so anxious, dare to plan a plot against you, I think the strength of the characters behind should be very strong, if you first catch the kidnappers around me, it is easy to alert them. You need to slowly The investigation of the secret, starting from the intelligence department, starting with the people who contacted the kidnappers around me, finding the black hands behind them, and then solving them once, in order to completely disintegrate the conspiracy, and to figure out that they are by your side and lurking in the Principality. Everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the princess acts directly and decisively, although the conspiracy can be disintegrated, the safety of the Joel family is a problem, and if not completely Fighting the silver horn, let them lose , Is difficult to recover within a short time, I had a lot of trouble in the future, since to do, then do absolutely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha frowned at her eyebrows: "Catch people directly, torture with the gods, and kill them before the other party reacts. There should be no small success. Lucine, you are too masculine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I think Mr. Evans said a lot, even the intelligence department is involved in this Things, we need to be treated with caution, I believe that Dagong will also agree with them." Camille's voice came from the depths of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha snorted: "I don't like the things that go around. If they dare to assassinate directly, I think they are men." Ok, everything is listening to you, Aunt Camille, I won't tell anyone about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
