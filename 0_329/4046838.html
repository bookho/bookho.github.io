			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squid of the fisherman Heilx is known as the "owner of the endless sea", and his men have seven legendary ranks of the sea general, but the endless Wang Yangguang is magic The area explored by the division is twice as large as that of the land, not to mention the deep waters that seem to be enveloped in the "fog" forever. Is such a broad "territory" completely ruled by eight legends? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if there is no foreign enemy, a legendary peak can control the endless ocean itself, and can rely on the sea elves of the Elf Wang Ting to control the magic parliaments of many archipelago. In the south, the Southern Church, which has supported several agents in the south, the moonlight and sea powers that have a weak relationship with the Dark Council, and the sturdy and snowy ocean Jeeps fishermen who make the stone, let Helkes the "endless king of the ocean" "I have to be cautious, especially the elf king court that directly confronted the conflict, but he has to concentrate most of his power." .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, at least one-third of the endless oceans are in a state of chaos without rulers, and the magicians are unable to navigate such a vast ocean. To achieve a fascinating exploration, the legendary magicians of the Magic Council are not sure how many legendary seas are in the endless ocean. After all, some seas are different from other intelligent life, and they live in the sea for a long time. It won’t rise up in the last millennium. It’s normal not to be known by outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after hearing the "mermaid singing" that can make people lose their minds and souls, Lucien and Natasha’s first reaction was hers. It is the "mermaid princess" under the "Endless Wang Yang Zhi", or another legendary mermaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter who she is, since I met, I asked the 'road' in the past, I don’t know if she lives in the depths of the ocean, she will know.' Azure Gate's." Lucien convinced her doubts and her face reappeared with a gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha nodded and suddenly admired: "The singer's voice is the most beautiful music in the world, and most of the wisdom life can't appreciate it." The beautiful and ethereal, once heard, the soul will be lost in the song, and can no longer pay attention to other things until death. I have been skeptical about this statement, and today I heard that the facts are better than rumors, if not We have entered the legendary field, and we have completely lost our souls just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the protection of the "mind barrier" and "time and space scepter", that is fascinating The song that went straight into the soul could no longer be introduced into her ears, which allowed her to clearly recall the shock she had just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien made a look at the ear and laughed in the mind connection: "After all, this is a legendary mermaid, huh, I tried to use my music. Knowledge restores her singing voice, and without the help of magic and mental power, it never achieves this effect, just like using a piano to play a magical melody directly, and not knowing her. The special point, that is, the use of mental skills and magic aids, is also difficult to imitate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul of the third-order legend of Lucien, facing this should It is a legendary mermaid, but it does not require extra spells to resist the song, so you can continue to "appreciate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the magician who has seen the mermaid and has not lost his soul is imitating her singing to build illusion magic, but due to various reasons, finally The magic of formation does not reach this extreme beauty, the feeling of shocking the soul, so they consciously did not use the "song of the mermaid" to name their own illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is anyone in the world who can imitate the singing of mermaid, then only you, the combination of the Arcanist and the great musician, I remember the previous part. The reason why magicians imitate the construction of spells is far from the difference, that is, they do not understand music, or the understanding of music is superficial." Natasha said half-jokingly, "At that time, you will write a copy based on the magic created. The magic effect of the music, let everyone first experience the beauty of the mermaid song, well, I have already thought of the name for you, called "An Soul Twelve Movements.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two talking and laughing, Lucien’s detection spells have already fed back the results. There is a reef, a blue long hair and waist mermaid floating on the water, close to the reef, singing in a sing, surrounded by a The mermaid and the sea creatures that have lost their minds and souls, there are giant octopuses, strange sharks with tens of meters long, monsters with heads and crabs...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides that mermaid, there is no other danger We can direct proximity. "Lucien strength enough though to myself who rolled the legendary mermaid, but still based on the magician's habit of peering eye of the first release and other investigative magic, to prevent falling into the trap of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
