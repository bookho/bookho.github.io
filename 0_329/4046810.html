			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we held a ceremony to try to summon the 'King of Angels' to come and make sure that we could successfully capture the artificial planet of the Magic Council, but he did not respond at all. Even the refusal of the light that symbolizes the surname has not appeared. The Pope’s majesty, will the 'King of the Angels' have a problem?” Li Liyuan originally told the story of the matter, and there was a strong concern in his tone. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "Rentatt War", the strength of the Southern Church has shrunk dramatically, so the existence and bias of the "King of Angels" increased their important surnames. At a new level, they can help them to stabilize the interior of the uneasy, skeptical, and a legendary peak who can drive the power of the six legendary third-order blazing angels of Heaven Mountain, is itself a powerful force that can influence the situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for Philip, the most important thing is whether the "King of Angels" does not respond to His Majesty the Pope? Is it because of the secret announcement of the method of cohesion of faith? Did the "King of Angels" have a scorpion when trying this road? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III listened to the answer of Philip, the expression did not change, slowly closed his eyes, behind the holy light, a little milky, creating A sense of sacredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the light of these lights, the half-air seems to open a door to the door of the "Heavenly Mountain", the sound of the ethereal sacred voice The endless light rushed out and molded into a near-substantial "Paradise Mountain" projection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angels and the Holy Spirit in the projection seem to be aware of them, and they have risen up and prayed to Pope Benedict III, who holds the Platinum Scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the Lord's spokesperson on the earth, walking in the world's incarnation, before returning to the mountain of heaven, more noble than the "king of angels", but also close to the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after "returning" to the mountain of heaven, He is directly integrated into the glory of the Lord, equal to the part of the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ceremony, they began to pray, praise and sing, and the projection of the seventh floor was slightly clearer than ever before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh floor of the Heavenly Mountain is a vast expanse of omnipotence and detachment, without any impurities, giving great pressure, as if He can really destroy the whole world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Benedict III is a god, it is difficult to clearly see the situation inside, only to faintly see the edge of the light carrying a back three The noble angel of the sixteen wings, holding a simple and sacred book in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'King of the Angels' did not go wrong, but fell asleep for some reason." Benedict III smiled and said, "Although his The guardian of God is very suitable for this kind of action, but can't it be done without him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a calm and calm face, but his eyes are gently picked up, Mecan Tron How could it be so weak, is this a multiple injury? What is he doing? After the Sarde incident, did his ambition sprout again? Who caused it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the "King of Angels" is surrounded by the power of "God of Truth", Benedict III is also a true god of the real thing, plus "Mecan Tron" does not Dare to enter a deeper area, can only "squat" on the edge, so he is keenly aware of the weakness of "Mecan Tron", from the inexplicable situation has heard a trace of anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no magic parliament to show the important role of the artificial planet in a live broadcast, the self-governing church in a relatively calm situation will certainly not try to summon the "king of angels" As in the past hundreds of years, as a result, he can not find his weakness, and for up to half a year, "Mecan Tron" can restore a little strength, cover up his weakness, because of him and The relationship between the "God of Truth" Tanos has nothing to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also thanks to the Magic Council, thank you Lucien Evans and Natasha Vaoliit..." Benedict III looked slightly gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the Pope’s question, Cardinal Bishop respectfully said: “Returning to His Majesty the Pope, summoning the 'King of the Angels’ is only a possibility of success. To improve and eliminate the interference of unexpected factors, it is not impossible without him. If you can take it out yourself, things will be much simpler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary peak to the genus is the sublimation of life, the immutation of immortality, the improvement of essence, even if it is impossible to use the "God will", it is difficult for Benedict III to easily kill any legendary peak, but the number of legendary peaks is also impossible. Smooth the gap between the two levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;腓力欣欣ly said: “The Pope’s own shot, the matter has been successful 90%.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I can only shoot once, the evil gods such as Silver Moon, Hell, Abyss, etc. are definitely waiting for the opportunity, hit me before I can perform 'God Drop', and hit me hard for this purpose. Silver Moon and Hell can even give up the dislike and the dislike between them, and join hands to act." Benedict III said the sound smoothly and slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know if Lucian and other magicians have discovered the real secrets of monsters and heavens in the world of the door, but what is certain is that they must have It is found that the story told in "The Voice of Mystery" is exaggerated, but there is no lack of truth. If you look at the essence through the phenomenon, you can faintly notice that there is a connection between yourself and the monster, and why you cannot use God's descending frequently. Not only in the flesh can not afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, He arranged the plan according to the two secrets that Douglas, Fernando, Lucien, the God of Silvermoon, and the Lord of Hell already knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One time is enough." 腓力脸露喜色, "In fact, under normal circumstances, according to our plan to destroy the artificial planet in the past, it is possible to capture it, but This time, the Magic Council took the initiative to show up and had to be wary of the possibility of setting up traps, so the plan must be changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, the church Because they can't arrange similar items on the track, the method of attack is the direct action of the legendary strong, and the hidden and orbital measures of the artificial planet itself have little effect on the premeditated legend. The main problem lies in the auxiliary arrangement on the artificial planet. The magical array of legendary magicians and the monitoring of the surrounding conditions back to Allinge's magical array made them a lot of scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So their action plan is simple and straightforward, first confirm which legends of the Magic Council go out to explore, and then wait for the opportunity to slow down, to play more, even if monitoring magic The squad sent the information back to Allinge, so that the legendary magician at Aringe came to the battle with the artificial planet, and could not stop it. When the other magical parliamentary magicians came to aid and formed an advantage, the artificial planet had been destroyed. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of action plan seems simple, but the difficulty is not low. First, you need to confirm whether the legendary magician is really going out. If you miscalculate the quantity and strength, then But with life to make jokes, and the legendary magician is prepared, it is difficult for non-legendary watchers to truly determine their whereabouts, so the church destroyed two artificial planets for so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, I’m worried that this capture of the artificial planet will fall into the trap of the Magic Council, after all, it’s seen by the pre-arranged transmission array. Douglas, Brooke, Fernando, Hathaway, Lucien? Evans and others are not around the wonderful experience, plus there is no magic defense array on the track, the legendary magicians can simply block the space, so that the subsequent reinforcements can not be directly sent to arrive, can only fly by, things It will become very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magician who studies the microscopic field is increasingly not in love, just focusing on the collision of particles..." Hearing the power of the previous plan After that, Benedict III shook his head and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the microscopic field of arcane research, the important surnames of the magic experiment are stronger than the outings, so the number and frequency of the legendary magicians are much lower. Fortunately, they also need to experiment with microscopic experiments in different environments to explore whether there are unexplored microscopic particles in various strange environments, such as positrons, so that they will not stay in Allinge, so that the Magic Council can organize terror at any time. Legendary squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the fields studied by legendary magicians are not limited to microscopic, but they also have to guard various areas of space, the four countries of the Straits and the coastal corridors of the Northland. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their differences in the micro-domains are getting louder and louder..." Philip sneered, and said, "In order to prevent the evil spirits from silvermoon." And Hell has a chance to attack the Pope, you don't need you to go directly to the orbit to capture the artificial planet, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will tell his own story Again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben’s face is heard with no expression, and the tone is unchanged: “I know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
