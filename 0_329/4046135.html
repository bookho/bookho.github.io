			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent world of black and white, when Lake Elsinore, full of strange red liquids, breaks free from the bondage of the "big cross", the space reverses. The lock is completely broken, and the broken lock has spread to the depths of the black and white gray world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, countless magical arrays quietly disintegrated in silent silence until a magnificent but still grayish black and white monotonous city appeared in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is like the reflection of Aalto, but the location of the building inside has become chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the still cold and cold "Aalto" city, there are also nine star reflections with infinite mysteries, and they form a big cross with a skeleton. Aalto is completely shrouded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of the "Essino Lake" puzzle is spreading, this "big cross frame" is also rapidly breaking, "Aalto" is slow Slowly a layer of faint silver, quiet and cold, not a little angry, "Aalto" seems to merge the cold and death of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pale and huge palm suddenly protrudes from the ground, each finger has a horrible bone spur, flashing the empty cold silver light, it runs through The world of the dead and the main material world appear directly in the depths of the real adi city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All creatures covered by its radiance, either with red-eyed mice, bleeding, indifference, loss of reason, or physical decay, becoming a walking dead, like Belem The water ghost in the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto City seems to have experienced a violent earthquake, the ground waves and ups and downs, countless citizens scrambled to run out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the huge pale palms holding down the ground and forcefully supporting, the entire Aalto city surface appears numerous bottomless cracks, a dozen The horrible humanoid monster of meters high, pale skin, bright red eyes and silvery horns jumped out and landed on the ground, causing Aalto to shake again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silvery light around it spreads like a tidal wave, leaving everything in the cold silence of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This humanoid monster sneered and said in hell: "The seal was never the former Duke, how can the devil's lies be believed. Anyone who thinks he can be and The devil's trade has become an item in my palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Todd with two third-level knights, four The second-level knight and four ordinary knights entered the Melzer Black Forest, tracking them by the smell of blood and the traces left by Lucien and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the place where Lucien and Wyan were separated, Todd stopped his footsteps and said solemnly: "They fled separately, and both sides have the blood taste of the princess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Wynne." The third-level Cavaliers Warns identified the bloody smell of Wynne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lund did not hesitate: "He is a four-level knight, tracked by me and Anatol. Vaughan, you go the other side, if the princess There, immediately notify us with the contact item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, Lord Lund." Longsang? Aaron prevented Lund's actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lend is not angry, but solemnly looks at Aaron: "Do you have other discoveries?" Although the heart is very disdainful and disgusted with the Dark Knight, but not Obstructing Lund by their special abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron looked at the deep places of the trees and answered seriously: "They can hide the traces, but they can't cover the shadows. Natasha is probably on the side." He pointed to Lucien's direction of escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief exchange, I understood Aaron’s ability in this area. Lund nodded: “I agree with your opinion, but I can’t be sloppy. There are few magical items. Anatol, you and Vaughan, with other knights, follow them, and I and Aaron are here. If the princess is with you, don't be busy, let me tell you by contact. Wynn's strength is very strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the Lord bless everyone all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ When Lucien heard Natasha’s words, he was a little silent, and his heart sighed slightly: “If you know the identity of my magician, you probably won’t say that.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, it comforts: "His Royal Highness, you still have a grandfather, and Ms. Camille, and friends like Felice, don't be too upset."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words are spoken, Lucien regrets, how to mention Camille at this time, emotional intelligence is really insufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Camil Aunt... May the Lord protect her safely." Natasha’s mood was significantly lower. "I killed her, but I knew it very early." Silvia is a magic apprentice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien flew in, and almost hit the tree in surprise: "Do you know?"<br />< Br,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, but I think that blood power is the product of the experiments of ancient magicians. After she learned magic, she might one day be able to study two girls and also be able to give birth to blood descendants. The way, then no one can stop us with this excuse." Natasha said that she was silent, and then spit a long breath, "I didn't expect the end to be the end."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is half true and half open the topic: "His Royal Highness, you are really ambitious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yuanda?” Natasha was a bit confused, but she soon understood. “I just tried very hard to find a solution to the problem instead of escaping the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien was ready to comfort a few more words, Natasha suddenly laughed herself: "Okay, don't say these things. Now it's flight." When it's time, it's not suitable for sadness and softness. Lucian, I will take two or three hours to recover a certain strength, and this time will depend on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I immediately let go of the control of the 'Thunder' sword. You left the breath on the way I taught you before. It is a super-long sword of five-level perfection. You can take it with any big knight. The following enemies contend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, her voice softly said: "Lu Xien, in fact, you do not need to help me at all, thank you, I will Always remember in your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Verdi is not an open-minded person. If I don't save you, I will still be chased by him. Kill, and we are friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason ahead is far-fetched, but Natasha is not entangled, Hey laugh or two, then urging Lucien hurry control "thunder" sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Natasha’s help and the right way, Lucien quickly left his breath on the sword and sensed it. Information:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha's thunder, five-level perfection super sword, built with the strange meteorites and the blood of the storm giant, with an attack close to the day knight The person who holds it, the strength will rise to the level of the ordinary storm giant, which is the peak of the normal big knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it hits every With lightning damage that can be paralyzed and traumatized by the enemy, with the effect of tinnitus deafness, and a chance of nearly 5% triggers real lightning. This lightning is mostly equivalent to the 'call to thunder' released by the fifth-order magician. However, less than one-thousandth of the odds are beyond the imagination of horror, as if entering the high-altitude thunderstorm layer. When used in thunderstorms, the chances are increased, and the user himself needs to be extra careful."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an adult gift for Little Natasha, it is imitation A thunderbolt scepter that a mortal can hold.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Yallow Blue? Hathaway? Hofberger<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Thunder" sword, Lucien immediately felt a trace of lightning coming back into the body from the hilt, stimulating his own slight paralysis, while the strength was greatly improved, so the foot was heavy, stepping on Broken a big tree root. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughs from behind: "Lu Xien, you need to get used to it. In fact, use more weapons or armor than your own level. It will be more troublesome. At this point, pure magic items are much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, if there are many powerful magic items, the more challenging Is it allowed?" Lucien thought that if there was a ring with a nine-ring magic attached, would it be hoped that the high-level magician would win? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
