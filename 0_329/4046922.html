			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic crystal lamp hangs high on the ceiling, and the slightly gloomy room is dyed with a white miserable feeling, which makes Downey subconsciously chill, seemingly Entered the castle of a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this also makes his attention completely back to the exam, no longer entangled in the teenager who is more beautiful than the female elf, looking around, Look at the environment inside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left side of the room is a simple long table with a large item on it, packed in a magical ware, directly stored in a vacuum magic array. Wrapped with emerald green leaves, so many kinds, but the right side is empty, even the carpet is not, revealing a light gray pattern stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mercury, low-order soothing stone powder..." Downey gently closed the door and walked quickly to the long table, and recognized it at a glance. To arrange the basic materials of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he sprinkled the sun flower powder on a silver candlestick, then lit the candle and carefully picked up a glass bottle filled with black liquid. It is aimed at the incandescent candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the candlelight, the surface of the glass bottle is slightly concave and convex, as if a flowing rune is flowing, and a black liquid also shows a pupil without a pupil. Amazing eyeballs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully discerning the shape of the eyeball and the magic runes on the glass bottle, Downey picked up the feather pen next to it and wrote on the parchment. : "...the eyes of the mutt ghost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the glass bottle, Downey turns his attention to the vacuum magic array, which has a winding Yellow-brown greasy cloth arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, even the mummy’s arm is there, Heidler College is really a luxury...” Downey’s eyes are light, his head is low, and the ghoul and the demon , ghosts, ghosts, etc. can be formed by "normal" undead creatures. To create a "mummy", there must be a complete and mysterious burial ceremony - this is a ritual from ancient times, so the strength of the mummies Normal is very strong. Magic resistance and his own melee defense are the best in the undead, even if the official mage, there is not much chance to get the mummies as a necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie writes the answer on the parchment, while looking at the mummy’s arm with a gaze, this level of material is what his primary schooler was able to Contacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although from the entangled cloth and the exposed skin. It is a very bad mummy. But it is also a mummy! But the body material of the suture can be Recycling..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Downey identifies the different body parts of these different magical creatures one by one:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the stinky fishman's lymph..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the wolf's front paws..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The cranium of the goblin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the magical goat's heel..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For half an hour, Downey recognized them one by one. Then, according to the theory of the body structure of the Necromancer and the requirements of the suture refining system, the suture corpse with its own style was designed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete and reduce, repair and change, Downey spent a long time to complete his suture corpse "model", then swallowed a spit, see Look at the wall clock on the wall: "It’s almost ten o'clock, can't delay any more, otherwise there will be no time to make up for the problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought Holding the mercury. Take time to outline the magic array on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentice’s mental strength is not strong, and the exam can’t take medicine, so Downey can only partially complete one part and finally complete a complete magic. Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than an hour passed, Downey sat on the floor and gasped. Regaining the mental power that has been exhausted a dozen times, then he stood up and placed his chosen materials one by one in the corresponding position in the magic array: "...mummy arm...the eyes of the mutant ghoul... The wings of the little devil...the ghost dust..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most important moment in his life. If he succeeds, he will enter Heidele, the most authoritative magic school of the Necromancer. The future of the future is immeasurable. If it fails, it is likely to become thousands of ordinary magic apprentices. First, as a consultant to a businessman, or join the police department, live a life far from the ordinary people but still far away from the upper class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only seventeen years old, willing to accept such numb hopeless life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s heart ignited a flaming desire flame, a desire for knowledge, a desire for life, a desire for a better future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Success, or failure, just look at this one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was half-squatting in front of the magical array, holding his hands on the core, and the blue eyes flashed a bit of singularity, which was full of mental power. sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silvery pattern glows with brilliance, the dark runes madly absorb the nearby Soulstone powder, and then the entire magical array is pale The brilliance is shrouded, and the magic stones are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s brain burst into a sharp pain after inspiring the magical array, but he did not care about the convulsions of his body, staring at him. Magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale brilliance dissipated a little bit, and there was a monster with a biplane in the center of the magic array. Its head was like a lion, its eyes had no pupils, and its left hand was wrapped in a tan. The greasy cloth strip, the body is composed of a piece of different flesh and blood, and these parts are not organically fused together, but it is like being forcibly stitched with needlework, which is horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster staggered and stood up. The all-white eye without a pupil swept through Downey, and suddenly he felt the soul hit by lightning, almost Syncope is on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this monster immediately lowered his head and stood there respectfully, no other action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful! Downey waved his arm and couldn't restrain his inner surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his hair was erected behind his back and seemed to sense some kind of breath from the deepest part of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Downey rushed directly to the side, while directing his own suture to block in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, the dull bang accompanied the sound of the collapse of the wall into Donnie’s ear, and then he saw the flesh and blood splatter splashing into his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I looked back, Downey’s eyes suddenly bulged, and the dust of the wall collapsed, a two- or three-meter-high monster slammed into it. He smashed his sutured body and smashed the corpse on his torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is not like a sutured body, the body parts are cluttered together, the eyes are on the arm, and the head is set in the belly. The body is surrounded by a strong black gas. At the same time, its horrible pressure made the sutured body that struggled to get up shudder, even if it had no intelligence, no ability to think, it still trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is like an ice cave. Want to cast spells to resist. However, he completed the suture corpse refining, but his head was sore, and there was no extra mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, what the hell is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The girl. No, teenager In the end, what kind of weird undead creatures have been produced? It’s terrible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I have to go to the insured teacher of the Necromancer to arrive.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart wants to think back, the will is determined to be determined, and Downey is unable to move with one finger under the suppression of the strange and undead creature, watching it go straight Come by yourself, a heart slowly sinks, desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is more horrible than the second-level knight I have met..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not easy Refining is successful. Will you die in the experimental accident at Heidele School of Magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
