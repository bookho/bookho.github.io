			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy... This is really the taste of Douglas..." Fernando and Douglas know each other a little, and often exchange magic with each other. Knowledge, a deep understanding of his style of naming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, when I saw this magic book, Fernando’s anxious floating mind flattened down, just like every time I studied magic, I forgot the darkness. The reality, forgotten the desperate situation, the whole heart has been invested in this magnificent world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, it’s hard to exist even where the magic book is quiet. Unless you stay away from it, can you simply escape and how long can you escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando reborn in his heart, but his hand has subconsciously opened the book, and the familiar handwriting has come to the fore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning is the definition of various symbols and scalars. This part of the content Fernando has participated in the discussion, no stranger, quickly understood and accepted, and then The first official one, Douglas opened the three laws directly and made mathematical preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Three Laws of Movement..." Fernando’s breathing became a little short, and he couldn’t control his emotions. What he should have read in his heart blew from his mouth. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three laws that Douglas summed up in the object are simple and straightforward, making people feel awkward, immediately aware of their correctness, and steeply It’s not a nonsense. Fernando feels more from these three laws. The whole world he knows breaks down into countless independent things, and works in accordance with these three laws! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysteries of the world are hidden in the phenomenon that people think they are justified. It is hidden in the truth that they thought it was nonsense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading these three laws, Fernando only feels that his views on the world are different! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely forgot the heavy defeats of the past, forgot the despair and sorrow brought by the church, and completely immersed himself in the world of this book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third, Douglas based on the three laws, discussed and proved the motion of the object in an ideal environment and under obstacles in a rigorous mathematical way. In the situation, Fernando's familiar calculus is the main tool that runs through the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the content, Fernando did not look very hard. Quite a lot has accumulated. Just wait for the point to break and feel the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he looks and admire and the emotions, the three laws of Douglas are really perfect! This is definitely the most profound explanation of the movement in the history of magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his admiration and emotion did not last long, and the pupil was completely occupied by the title of the third article: "On the law of the movement of the celestial body and the cosmic system." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the first three articles is like the tide of savings and the foundation of the article, which rushes out in this article. Convergence a thing called "gravity". The stone is shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and. Douglas used this to discuss the shape of his own planet, the movement of the silver moon, the trajectory of the comet, the tides of the ocean, and then analyzed and constructed a huge universe system, including the natural phenomena such as stars, planets, comets, and ocean tides. system! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That moment. The whole world is in front of me..." Fernando forgot everything, only described in a later sentence in such a sentence. Your own feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes seem to have no focal length, a storm is brewing, and countless electric lights are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heathery did not seem to notice the change of Fernando's breath, still holding a pen and paper quietly, checking what, the above formula, content, and "magic philosophy" The third chapter of the mathematical principle is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this part of the content, Fernando has not returned to God for a long time, and his hands clenched the book with force, and the blue veins bulged, seemingly afraid that it would be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too expensive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he snarled: "Gravity! This is the mysterious power of the traction star movement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression becomes urgent, from the storage bag Take out the pen and ink and calculate and deduct it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are very clear, consistent with a large number of observations of the astrology, Fernando is excited, excited and stunned to Hathaway: "This is the mystery of our world." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Hathaway nodded in agreement, although the gray ash's eyes were indifferent, but there was a layer of water mist, oh, dreamy and blurred. It’s beautiful, it seems that her royal princess, who is not a magician, is also inexplicably moved by the mystery of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando made a fist in his right hand and suddenly hit his head: "Not an illusion, not an illusion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes have a constant spell, looking through the curtains that are not thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was late at night, the stars were dense, and the stars were flashing, but in Fernando’s eyes, there was a line between them, and they were bound by the silver. line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no more magical pattern than it is beautiful..." Fernando really sincerely, without a word of praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri will stop the feather pen in her hand, and look at Fernando with the icy silver-gray eyes: "Don't despair?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s expression was distorted, and the voice became low: “After reading Douglas’s Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy, I have a feeling that everything in the universe is under the control of our magician... Although there is no hope, I want to make the last drop of blood for this pride, this pride, and deeper mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, if given Our time, let more magicians understand the laws of the celestial body, understand the mysteries of the universe, master the calculus, and there will be a blowout of high-ranking magicians, sorcerers, and even legendary magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, after reading this book, although I did not advance to the Eight Rings, I have been sure to become a sergeant within ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the emotional agitation, Fernando confided with a rare voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei gently daggers: "It takes time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her consistent rule is that The ability to speak clearly in two words, absolutely no three words! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time, not necessarily without time..." Fernando muttered, his thoughts turning. Analyze the current situation and find a place to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the carriage stopped slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on." Hathaway stood up, pushed the door open and flew straight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly, fly out? Fernando’s eyes are wide open. When did this little girl become a magician? And at least five rings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of the car is an acquaintance of Fernando - "Deep Blue Gift" Sharp, he snorted: "All of you have broken Hathaway, she Secretly went to the study room to find out the 'Elemental Will' information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical empire of a legendary organization "Elemental Will" died in "The Truth The sword "Hofenberg's hand. The rumors of materials, books, etc. in it have not been completely destroyed. Instead, it was secretly collected by Hoffenberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s mouth twitched, I just taught mathematics, never mentioned magic! Don't rely on me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the carriage stopped was a corner of a secluded manor, and Fernando had just got off. Suddenly my heart moved. The eyes cast on the darkness on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark. The tall Douglas came out and his appearance seemed to mature again, like a charming gentleman in his 40s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
