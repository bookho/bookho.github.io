			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave where the altar is located, silent, crystal clear, most of the seawater freezes into ice, and a "deep blue guard" guarding the altar is Covered with snow and ice, they are stiff in place. Some of them hold tridents, some hold coral sticks, and their postures are different. The scales are sure to appear, like the most delicate and delicate statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only the deep blue water that surrounds the altar, which is blocked by the extraordinary power, and it is slightly rippling. Lucien walks up to the bright red coral. Obviously different from the surrounding seawater, stretch your hand and press it on the plane where the two seawater meets like a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the curse of the slaps of water, the complex magical array structure appears in this dark blue sea, and the mysterious and strange runes are kept. circulation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Rhein’s description, it takes at least three to four minutes to slowly and carefully crack the trap that does not trigger the hidden warning traps in the altar defense arsenal. At this time, Lucien did not care, and made complicated gestures along with the changes in the mantra. Under their cooperation, the mental power fluctuated and spread, and the defensive circle was directly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! The red coral around the altar suddenly screams, igniting a wave of water, and reverberating in the cave where the altar is located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, the high priest who is not far from the altar will immediately feel the alarm and quickly come to solve the enemy, but in this sharp voice, surrounded by Still quiet and deep cold, there is no movement, because the high priest Blanchett is trapped in the "Majos's maze", even if it can detect the situation, it can not handle, and other fishermen are in the Leading the team to prey on the outside, simply could not find the change of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it easy for Lucien to pass through the deep blue water layer and set foot on the altar of the precious sea bream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action just made is a little risky, but it’s easier and safer than trying hard to get the high priest away from the altar for four to five minutes. When it was discovered that someone was trying to open the altar, the high priest would certainly not be numb and let the "deep blue guard" of his hands start. For most intelligent creatures, one is slow and one urgent, and two different situations are naturally two different treatments. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you can't numb the high priest, let it open the altar to deal with it, the road has been mixed into the altar of the road, there is great confidence from the relatively weak The internal breakout leaves, you must know that the seven-level 寇 鱼 人 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于 由于Even if Lucien can't use the "sun scepter" to trap it, he has enough power to escape before the altar is fully functional.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say, know the opponent's spell ability in advance, and prepare accordingly, then the combat power can be greatly improved, and even the superior level kills the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep blue pool in the center of the altar. The tall fisherman statue stands in it, except for the pool under the feet, there is no water around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the god of the ocean, Ambola, seeing that he was carved extremely fierce, with six arms, each holding a trident, Lucien smiled Shaking his head, it is still the original religious aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No delay, giving yourself a "brute force", "the cow's bull", after pouring a bottle of magic potion, Lucien Holding the pale justice of the wooden hand guard, take out the dirty blood ball from the storage bag, put it into the pool, watch it melt quickly, and dye the dark blue "Holy Water" into rust-like colour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood up and sang a long spell against the statue of the god of the sea, and the surrounding seas followed the hard sounds and swayed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock is getting more and more intense, and the rust-like "holy water" quickly spread to the body of the statue of Ambola, giving it a bloody color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Lucien, who was wearing the "曰之冕", sensed two twisted space cracks in the statue of the god of the sea, one of which was unexpected. Among the dead spirits, a pale color, with a strong sense of death, but also a faint warmth, giving Lucien a familiar and strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mourning of the spell, there is no time to think, Lucien tries to make his attention more focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, while reading the last spell, Lucien seemed to be in a world like a virtual world. The right eye saw a cold and dead black and white space. A huge fisher of nearly ten meters was lying quietly in the pale. In the pool, his eyes were tightly closed, and the whole body scales lost their color, as if they had died. Even so, it was so illusory to see it, and Lucien felt heavy pressure, a little inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the left eye, Lucien saw a dead wilderness wandering through countless undead creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the wilderness, there is a palace built with a huge skeleton of the roots, which seems to be transparent with the attention of Lucien. Under the wandering grievances, ghosts, skulls, and corpses, there was an unreal monster wearing a black robe with a long sickle in his hand and a dry, decaying skin on his face, showing a sly look. The eyes are pale and empty, and there is no trace of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster turned his head slightly, and his eyes seemed to cross the heavy space barrier, colliding with Lucien’s gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange burst of coldness is inextricably generated from the body. Lucien only feels that the uncontrollable paralysis spreads rapidly to the whole body, and the vitality flows out like this, at such a speed. Lucine suspects that it will take only seven or eight seconds and he will become a rotten corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the soul can think, physical and mental power seems to be completely paralyzed, unable to break free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the warm and soft power suddenly flowed into the body from Lucien’s left hand and chest, and paralysis and icy quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was able to move, Lucien couldn’t help but tremble, suddenly, the world seemed to be a virtual world, and the strange sights seen by both eyes disappeared. It is still an altar carved by sea bream. It is still an inanimate statue of Ambola. It is still a deep blue pool. It seems to have been done just now. The scenes witnessed have never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was the bones of the wilderness?" Lucien’s "demon studies" was not bad, the basic knowledge was qualified, and he quickly recognized what he saw. The wilderness, "Is that one of the demon monarchs of Apmos? Has he not been missing for thousands of years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apsis rules the endless abyss The 123rd floor of the "Boneless Wasteland" has many titles. The more famous ones are "The Undead Lord", "Life Reaper" and "Death Monarch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinkingly shook his head, Lucien began to systematically deal with the traces of his own remains, and then left the altar and changed from the ordinary to the formation of ordinary polluted fish. Quietly walked away, and when I was in the distance, I flew in the air and walked at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three minutes, Lucien was far from the polluted waters, and at this time it was quite unbelievable and funny: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past, every time I did things, there were always twists and turns, and even very dangerous changes. I have never been as smooth as this sneak into the fisherman's altar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are good and bad things, and there are smooth and complicated twists and turns, which is consistent with common sense. I always encounter bad changes. I will think that I am miserable."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark night sky, countless stars shine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singer and priest of the singer, Blanchet, flew to a star, but found that this is not a real planet, but a broken star map, extremely complicated . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brecht’s breathing suddenly became heavy, and he understood that he had encountered the most “malciful” weird maze! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his own spell power is not rich enough, but lived for so long, the knowledge is not bad, know that the normal maze is a twisted space, built into a complex maze As long as the trapped person can find a way out, he can leave early, and the labyrinth of various deformations turns the "fan" of the road into a "fan" of other aspects. For example, the labyrinth now, the road is very simple, no Need to find, as long as a few broken star maps are complete and correct, you can leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the strong, this is the most vicious type of maze! Because they don't understand the star map at all! If you want to go out, either the power exceeds the caster, the maze is broken by force, or the time of the maze is over, usually three to fifteen minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
