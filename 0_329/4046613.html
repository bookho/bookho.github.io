			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of three giant thunders allowed Fernando and Helen of the 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower to temporarily slow down to open the "real secret" half-plane Efforts, turned to look out the window, saw the lightning that cut through the sky and illuminate a field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows the world is shaking?" Helen’s skin is like ice and snow. At this time, it’s even paler without a trace of blood. She frowned slightly and looked outside. The sky is changing, a little unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s not that gravitational theory has proved wrong, but the question about the nature and source of gravity has caused confusion in the founders of this field, and even produced supremacy. There are thoughts that lie on everything, so it is doubtful that the necessary and correct surnames for gravity and arcane studies are suspected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sway of the Arcanists is directly related to their recognition of Douglas’ authority and spiritual pillars, and it’s clear that the legendary wizards are better than Ordinary people are low, and there is no shortage of Brooks that has subverted the teacher's particle theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Helen will be confused and disbelieve. The most important thing that the legendary magician agrees with the authority and pillar of the Speaker is to regard him as his father’s own self. Without shaking, which idiot would be stupid enough to not confirm the real situation, completely lost confidence and shaken cognition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, she will doubt how the other party is promoted to the legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face is full of irresistible anger and doubt: “From the perspective of the scope and the illusory feeling, it is indeed the mapping of the cognitive world to the real world. Influence, but not necessarily shaken..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, first open the Allinge defense lock, so as not to cause destruction of the surname, but also prevent the enemy just now The sneak sneaked in. After the initial confusion and no reason, Helen gradually recovered calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Element will headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is talking to the astrologer living in the tower. Suddenly, the electromagnetic signal becomes quite noisy and chaotic, and I can hear very obvious thunder sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annonis, what is the situation?" Lavindi asked in a deep voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Astrologer" Annonis has a hint of uncertainty: "The weather of two kilometers around Aringe suddenly changes, with squally winds, lightning and heavy rain. Attack..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will it be..." Raven didn't finish, looking at Ariel's position with a sullen look, faintly seeing the sky The silver lightning in the middle of the snake is like a long snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should not..." Annonis understood the meaning of Raven, and the voice replied slowly, gradually silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope is not what I think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavin is concerned about countless electricity on the first side Aringe, who was emptied by the snake, informed Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "sky radio station", a group of half panic and half open each other The Arcanist was alarmed by thunder, filled with lightning and filled with vision, and his expression was obviously sluggish and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can a sudden storm?" an arcane whispered, ignoring that this dark, repressed storm scene afflicted the true state of his heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of lazy rain hits the heart and arouses the panic of no one for a while. Some people forcefully calm down and comfort themselves: "This is a month of enthusiasm, rainstorms at any time. Isn't it normal to lower it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder broke out again, and the Arcanists shook a little, and someone blurted out: "No, not normal, there is no change in humidity and pressure in front!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane masters suddenly saw the Aringe lock up, and all areas were filled with a faint mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is connected with the weather and the precarious situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think so much, what's the matter of the top reviewers, we don't need to worry about it." Samantha tried to make her voice look calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was true, she felt that she had to reassess her impression of the church. They were not so reckless and arrogant, but they would rely on strength and assassination to do things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling thunder was introduced into Black's ear, and he bitterly and self-deprecatingly looked at the end of the scene: "The weather has also sensed it." Are the desperates of the Linau archers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atoms In the office of the institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen in Lucien’s hand is written with beautiful words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is based on two basic premises. The first one is the equivalent principle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Through the above experiments and arguments, we can see that the gravitational field Everything in the object has the same acceleration, which can be expressed as the quality of the habitual surname and the mass of gravity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft of the side-by-side print, the accumulation of the past few years The idea is that when Lu Xien writes a certain paragraph, there will be a corresponding paper full of words and expressions flying over, and with a little modification, the previous expression is perfectly accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Lucien’s writing of the thesis and the idea of ​​coherence are very fast, and it takes no long before the principle of equivalence and the principle of general relative surname The expression was completed and a relativistic interpretation of gravitation and a description of geometric language began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, analysis tools such as Evans geometry and metric tensor, which were completed together with Levsky, Mina and other towers, came in handy. This paragraph is complicated and difficult to understand, but it also contains profound mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ordinary arcans can also understand, to drive away the confusion caused by the Speaker’s remarks, Lucien added a description of the metaphor:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the previous geometric model, the space is like a net with a surname, and the object in it is like a ball that falls on the net of the surname. Its quality will cause the web (space) to sag and shrink, causing the curvature of the surrounding space and time, and this kind of bending will cause other smaller mass balls on the surname network (space) to roll toward the mass ball. This is the essence of gravity - curved time and space!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we can see that the time and space we are in is not an intuitive understanding of the tower geometry The straight time and space, but the curved space and time with the curvature greater than zero established by Evans geometry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing and writing, Lucien recognizes the changes in the stars in the world, the change of gravitation, the light and darkness of the main star of fate are also changing rapidly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Lucien seems to have seen a phantom, it is a vast expanse of stars, a starry sky staring at everything, and this starry sky is projected to In my own cognitive world, numerous special and complex model symbols have been produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive world is accelerating, and interaction with the soul is accelerating, and a spell model within the soul naturally begins to outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic "Time to stop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder outside the window came to an abrupt end, the lightning twisted, and the torrential rain seemed to be blown by countless winds in different directions, drifting in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of deep black envelopes Aringe, letting the storm bend, letting the starlight coming in outside bend, letting the space bend with the night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien did not stop, and after a little explanation in a language that was easy for ordinary arcans to understand, he began the "Einstein Gravitational Field Equation", the core of the general theory of relativity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking out the window as if everything is twisting and twisting Helen’s eyes are wide and unbelievable: “This is the mapping of gravity...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s dignity seems to have relaxed a lot of nod: “This is Cognitive world semi-curing based on gravitational theory!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creator is full of confusion about gravity, thinking that it is a mistake from beginning to end, there is a When the supremacy exists and everything is in the air, is there a magician who knows the world's semi-curing based on gravitational theory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hear Douglas’s conversation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still really finding the way, more confident in gravity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sky Radio Station". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha and other arcane masters were shocked by the strange scenes outside, the dark and curved time and space tearing the wind and rain, the scene is fragmented, pervasive A faint mist, and the depth of the fog seems to hide a black monster that can destroy the world. Zhang is waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." an archer whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha seems to think of something, shocked and delighted: "There is a Master who uses the theory of gravity to perceive the world as a semi-cured!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black in the outskirts of the villa was shocked by the sights before him, he has never seen such a mysterious sky! The curving night, the distorted starlight, the storm that is divided, like the end of the world in the bard story! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened tonight?" Black whispered, his body twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter in the distance of Ketonia sees the city of the sky As if wrapped in a dark ball, whether it is the starlight that shines in, or the spontaneous lightning, there is a strange and inexplicable bend, and the heart suddenly rises a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Ketonia subconsciously asked about the projection of Pope Benedict III. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing's voice is slightly cold and succinct: "This is not a cognitive world shake, but someone knows the world is semi-cured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And based on gravitational theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia was surprised: "He didn't hear Douglas and you." The conversation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen fell, and the gravitational field equation on the road to the paper was fully presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was completely caught in the illusion of the starry sky beyond the detachment, and the cognitive world changed dramatically. The special and complicated model symbols began to spliced ​​into one whole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "time stop" spell model in his soul naturally formed, unwittingly promoted the Nine Rings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black storm of the bend, a faint illusion of darkness emerged, and it sucked the falling rain and sucked the wind. The fallen lightning was sucked over, and the projected starlight was sucked over, and the whole heavenly image change and the curved ball were all sucked up, and collapsed into a group of super-horror blacks that devour all the means of destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando and Helen looked at this scene with a slight sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
