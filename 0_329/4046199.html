			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the library giant Alex did not quickly give the name of the book or thesis, but hesitated a few seconds later and asked: "Ivan Mr. Si, are the data and speculations that prove wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course, as a magician of an elemental system, I want to have an arcane concept. The proposed elemental magic development has a clear and complete impression. Whether it is proved wrong or affirmative, there is the value of research and mining, at least to avoid making the same mistake, isn't it?" Lucien said himself real thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little old man next to him made a wretched laughter again: "If you just want to have a complete impression of the development of elemental magic, then I recommend you "Elemental Magic." History, a book edited by the Arcanists, revised every ten years, the last time was four years ago, similar to "The History of Necromancer", "The Magical History of the Stars"... "The History of Arcane and Magic" ""."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have said these books early..." Lucien looked helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Alex has also submitted the title:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" History, author, supreme jury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The New System of Elements, author, Arcanist Yalo Blue? Hathaway? Hoffenberg ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic-Molecular Theory, author, Arcanist Oliver Constantine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "" several atomic weight determination and review the latest atomic weight table "" eight temperament table of elements ", author:? large arcanist Fernando Balisita" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" "Double Ratio Relationship in Magical Pharmacy Experiments", "Spiral Pattern of Atomic Amount", author, Nine-level Arcanist Raven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The common surname of certain metal elements and the idea of ​​improving the corresponding magic"..., author, level 7 arcane master Gaston."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ..." "From the common surname to explore between elements Law and guessing..., author, level 4 orthodox Ulysses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The comparison of the surname and atomic weight of Mithril and Silver "..., the author, the fourth-level arcane master Timothy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......""The determination of the surname of the new element '谟'", author, Level 4 Arcanist Meredith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The name of the title or thesis submitted by Alex is not all up to date, and According to the requirements of Lucien, from the big to the small, from the system, the common surname to the individual elements, the determination of the surname quality of many elements is completed decades ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, there are Mr. Ulysses’s papers." After Lucien heard the name of Ulysses’s paper, he moved his heart and looked sideways. Lazar smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard did not fear this time, all admire and have a sentimental mood: "Yes, this is Mr. Ulysses at the first level. The essay written by the surgeon, although his discussion and prediction of the surname of the element was overthrown by the newly discovered elements, it was a sensation at the time. His idea of ​​not being bound by the inherent thinking and bold speculation made people Admire and guide many arcane masters to explore the law of the elements, even including the great Arcanist Lord Baalista and the nine-level Arcanist Mr. Ravendi, if not the Lord Hathaway was exploring in the opposite space at that time, It may also join this rank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the title of the book and the name of the paper, it seems that there is no elemental rule to find the surname." Lu Xien asked A point of concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they have all been overthrown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is the little old man with bright red robes. His expression is rare and serious. "Since the discovery of new elements by spectral analysis, the number of elements has increased by nearly ten. Their appearance has overturned several inferences and predictions of elemental laws by the former arcuists. And there are quite a few introductions in this paper. Young people, this is a serious exploration topic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar has a regret: "Yes. Even though the Archaic Master Barista was inspired by the eight-tone law and speculated that the elemental temperament table was overturned, he later abandoned this aspect of research by adding a new discovery to the field of electromagnetic waves. Officially announced the failure to explore the law of elements, and now similar research has basically stopped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, what is Mr. Ulyss?" Lucien asked curiously, what is the idea of ​​a genius magician who first began to explore the laws between elements? Razal frowned and thought: "I heard that Mr. Ulysses was studying the newly discovered elements before, and he does not seem to want to give up the law of the elements." Exploring, but as if there is no progress, there have been signs of diverting the field of research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Persistence is the virtue of an arcane master." Short old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his wretchedness and repeated interruptions, Lucien couldn’t help but look at his chest and wanted to see his arcane badge, magic badge and management nameplate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result surprised Lucien that the old man had nothing on his chest, neither a nameplate nor an arcade badge or a magic badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, my magical robe looks good? Combines the mysterious feeling of ancient magic robe, and I have the bright red and some modern clothes style I like. "The old man stood upright and proud." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is a beautiful woman, Lucien will probably feel seductive and then compliment a few words, but he has a few wrinkles, white hair and a lot of half The old man, even if he looks good, Lucien can only secretly swear in his heart: "Pervert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Lucien pretended not to hear the little old man Think carefully: "Is this world's micro level very different, resulting in a special element structure, no regularity of the surname, or because there are few types of elements, they have not yet discovered? Well, I have to do all the magic experiments of the measured elements first. Once again, let yourself have an intuitive understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, Lucien borrowed the "History of Arcane and Magic" "Elemental Magic History" "Elements The new system, "Atom-Molecular Theory" and other basic books and "Summary of several atomic mass spectrometry methods and the latest atomic scale" "Elemental temperament table" "Determining the surname of the new element '谟'" A total of thirty-two papers, packed in storage bags  full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, have you read so many books in seven days?" Lazar and Lucien stepped out of the library and gave him a surname Eighteen books are very puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "In a few days, I am going to Douglas Magic School. It is estimated that for a long time I will focus on teaching apprentices and making up for myself. The base of the Arcane will not come to the parliament headquarters, so I am going to record them with the record magic array, so as not to run back and forth. Right, Lazar, you noticed that the magician just did not wear the badge and nameplate. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas Magic School is on the southeastern edge of Sky City, covering a wide area, quiet and quiet, but far from the Magic Tower of the Parliament, it takes half a ride. Hours or so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Lucien is going to apply for the basics of the Arcane Basics when he plans to return to the Magic Tower of the Headquarters. It really calms down." Lazar is quite I admire the authenticity, and then I answered with a serious look. "I noticed, so I pulled you at the time and told you not to talk nonsense. The old gentleman may be a member of a committee, only their husband at this level. Do not wear badges to run around in the magic tower, and command the alchemy life without the nameplate. Oh, they are not a little strange, the name of the Mr. Jidu is slightly weird, suddenly run to the day when the administrator is normal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said: "Slightly weird? Slightly metamorphosis is right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucy En did not speak, Lazar thought he was worried about borrowing books, so he smiled and said: "In fact, you don't have to worry about the cost of the library. The magicians will exchange books with each other in private, as long as you can join them. Circles. If you record books they don't need You must pay a certain amount of money that is cheaper than the library, but it is not free, and knowledge is valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just met two at Douglas Magic School A friend, I will introduce you to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is very interested in Lazar’s proposal, but he has a little doubt: "Is the council no matter?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the library is so expensive, it is to encourage the magicians to communicate privately, or how to stir up the spark of wisdom?" Lazar said humorously. "Well, I will tell you about the two magician friends. They are first-class arcans, one is the second-ring wizard Jerome who is good at astrology and elements, and the other is the second-ring element master Rock. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
