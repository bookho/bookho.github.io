			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the question of Lucien, Elf Queen Aglesia thought about it: "The legendary materials of time and space are very rare, and we have indeed had a collection. However, they have been used in the forging and the construction of the locks of the legendary items. If you want to obtain similar materials, I only know that there are four places that exist, one is the emperor of the squid. Azure key '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contemporary scorpion fisherman emperor is the "endless king of the ocean", the existence of the legendary peak, all the sea is its "home" So, after Lucien listened, he just nodded slightly and did not answer anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrea continues: "In addition, the Dark Ages of the Dark Council, Danisos, is itself the best space-time material. If there are other Taikoo Time Dragon bones in the Dragon's Tomb of the Dragon Marsh, it should be used as well, but the dragon itself is a rare race. The time dragon is the most rare. The Elf has recorded the time dragon that has been promoted to the Taikoo. No more than five, so it is equally difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the introduction of the Elves, Lucien has some frowns, which is not in line with his own ideas and surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aglesia’s turn: “Compared to the previous two choices, the remaining two roads are relatively easy, and there is a hidden position in the abyss. In the face, the ancestors of the elves named the 'chaotic starry sky', and at its core will naturally condense the 'space-time slate'. Once taken away, the entire plane will shrink and hide, and can no longer be found until the time has passed. It will re-aggregate the core and reappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our elves have ever got the 'space-time slate' and used it to build an important part of the puzzle. If the demon of the 'chaotic starry sky' is not promoted to the king, then the 'space-time slate' will definitely exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil's promotion to the magician, knight, druid, etc. They are different. They seem to rely on the opponents of the same level. They are actually the feedback of the abyss and the reward of the abyss. Therefore, after unifying a certain layer of the abyss, the core strength of the plane will be blessed to the demon lord. Body, enhance its strength, let it Order kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "chaotic starry sky" layer, if there is already a demon to become a king, it means that "time and space slate" must be merged with it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Chaotic Starry Sky’?” Lucien chewed the name, and the Magic Council’s record of the abyss never had this plane, and the same was true of the ancient magical empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante also revealed a trace of doubts, apparently not heard of "chaotic starry sky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Queen smiled and said: "Because the 'chaotic starry sky' will shrink the hidden relationship by itself, except for the ancestors who accidentally discovered this plane, no one knows if Evans is interested, I will tell you how to find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I thank you first." Lucien immediately interface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aglia gave secret information to Lucien by secret communication, then said: "The fourth place is 'Silent Hell', the predecessor of the 'Frost Duke 'Tiveridis had a very strange 'star nucleus' in the 'Star Tomb' before his disappearance. It is certain that this nucleus is still hidden somewhere in 'Silent Hell', maybe Freddis wants to resurrect with it, and now the Duke of Ice is trying to find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tivertis is fallen under the joint venture of Rhine and Sald Intelligence, the Magic Council did not tell the Elf, because there is not much place worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resurrection..." Lucien snorted and said, "The Lord of Silver" Tiffedis’s style of acting is really possible. In this regard, but who called it bad luck, met with the Rhine who can summon the power of the silver moon and the Sald who can use the "light of judgment", under the double blow, in addition to the gods, there will be no legendary There is hope for resurrection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This insidious, scheming, big devil has been stalked by the singularity of Alto, who was sealed by Muskillin and others in the spirits world. First, the passer-by was ruined by many people, and then fell into the conspiracy of others. When I died, I didn’t know what happened. I have to say that it is a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence in mind, Lu Xien once again got up and thanked, said that he would make a careful choice - Taikoo Time Dragon and his own no enemies, no innocent, In order to kill the material, it does not match its own name. The same is true of the endless Wang Yangzhi. It is obviously impossible to give yourself the "blue key" to yourself when you see yourself, so there is only "chaos starry sky" and "Silent hell" two choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banquet, Lucien, Natasha and others left the "elf tree" and flew outside the lock, ready to jump back to Allinge with the help of the "atomic universe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I think things are very strange, saying that Lord Ferragand is filthy, I believe that the reality of Martha’s self-destructive death is too strange. But why is Lord Lanhill, why the Elf Queen will find and stop it in time, she said that you found a clue and informed her at a critical moment?" Heidi, after participating in a police investigation mission, awakened the police Detecting the soul, asked questions from Annick, Katrina and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed twice and looked at them: "Lanhill is indeed behind the scenes. As for the specific truth of the matter, what does it have to do with us? As long as the elves can accept it, we don't have to do anything extra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it weird?" Heidi was very excited and felt that his reasoning was confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne no longer answers her, laughs and speaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the intelligence of the highest rating group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict III's body is constantly changing, sometimes filled, sometimes shrinking, seems to be experimenting with something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, His changes stopped, his eyes shrank slightly, and then he lifted the Platinum Scepter and cast a prophetic magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Dark Lord' Gonheim kills and swallows the former demon prince?" The fall of a legendary peak is a big deal, and Gonheim Without deliberate concealment, Benedict III naturally got clear and clear results, and the changes of the Elf Queen, He also obtained vague hints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III put down the "Platinum Scepter" and walked back and forth, thinking: "Who told them the law of the gods?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that he has obtained the legend of the god-like law from his own hands and deliberately leaked it to the Dark Lord and the Empress Empress, so he wants to find out who he is and confirm his true purpose— - Although in accordance with the original plan, He is also prepared to introduce the law of the gods into the forest of Stroop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a while, the cardinal outside is holding the intelligence of the abyss change - the church always has a strong monitor of the abyss and hell:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The Pope, the 'Dark Lord' sneaked into the 'Devil's Prince' in the 'Abyss Stomach Bag' and successfully pulled the 'Tough Sea' into the 'Ice Fortress' , become the new 'Devil Prince'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a plane change caused the abyss to oscillate, the traces can not be concealed, so similar intelligence in one force organization It spread quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kingdom of Holm, in the forest on either side of the railroad track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog head full of dragon scales squinted and looked around at a group of tattered dog heads: "Wait a minute." The caravan of Manchuria passes through this road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, head." A wretched kobold said with a courtesy, this is their tribe. The new leader, who came from the north, was able to disperse Longwei because of his strength. He easily killed the original leader and swallowed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-scaled dog head carries a wooden stick with a nail-filled nail: "The dragon's blood in my body has awakened and will become the king of the great kobold. It is your pleasure to serve me respectfully!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kobold is a kind of Yalong with a weak dragon blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the head." The wretched dog head was brought to the ground with other ethnic groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜, 哐当哐当. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the whistle and the iron wheel hitting the track came from a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
