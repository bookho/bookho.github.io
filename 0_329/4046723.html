			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a pure light, Buck couldn’t help but close his eyes, but there was a dark red eyes with visceral monsters in his mind, and his back was out. A layer of dense cold sweat. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he felt that a horrible will swept his body, making his mind slow and paralyzed, and it took a while to slow down. Come over, and the will has long since disappeared. The light that directly appeared in front of the sun disappeared, and the internal organs and cracked monsters disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the streets that were basically damaged, Buck shuddered. If he took the ordinary police detective to investigate the area, it would be missing. One of the population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., the monster has been wiped out by you?" Buck asked cautiously, not only worried about the monsters coming back, but also the doll face that often laughed at the eyes. From the heart of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked sadly at the silver badge on the ground: "In theory, it has no possibility of surviving."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver badge is also not recoverable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of summoning the legendary plane requires complex and expensive magic rituals, even if you rely on it It is the "atomic universe" of his own teacher. There is no shortage of communication process. Therefore, in order to prepare most of the modular ritual steps in advance and store them, special precious materials are needed to make special alchemy. Items - Even if I have been at the Institute of Atomic Research for many years, I have published many papers and achievements, and I have a part-time job at Holt School of Magic, and I have only one or two pieces of financial resources. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pure money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Heidi’s answer was heard, Buck gave a long sigh of relief and secretly accused himself of not being involved in similar incidents in the future, otherwise he would die. do not know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the crumbling two-story building and proposed: "There should be residual clues inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi nodded slightly, was about to step into, suddenly felt a sharp dizziness, apparently excessive mental digestive, she assessed: "Even if you can later 'spell trigger' really reduced to five magic The standard of high-ranking magicians is still six rings. The cognitive world is not semi-essential and cannot be called high-order. The high-level magic assisted by external forces can only afford one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Heidi’s pale face and breathing quickly, Buck asked with care: “Ms., are you okay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s good to rest.” Heidi took out a tube of “Song of Water” and the cool feeling felt like a heart and lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi needs a break, Buck naturally does not dare to enter the tattered two-story building, so he casually finds the topic: "Ms., the magic you used before is Isn't the simplification of 'eternal blaze'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original magical parliament and the Southern Church’s war in the half-space of Rantat was big because of the existence of the “land of heaven” Some ordinary people have witnessed that "eternal blaze" has become the most powerful magic in Buck's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi laughed: "No, just use the fusion force simulated in the teacher 'Atomic Universe' to enhance my 'mystery light', It is a surname with a little 'eternal blaze.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a simplified, miniaturized "eternal blaze", then it is impossible for both of them. Resist the explosions that are not far apart, and will be saved by energy storms and ultra-high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Heidi’s face gradually became rosy, and then he and Bach added a lot of spell effects and carefully entered the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a trace of burnt black in the hall, the last trace of the existence of the visceral monster, and the central is a strange magical array that does not conform to common sense, even if it is damaged, When he saw it, Heidi also had obvious dizziness. Like the anti-phagosis of hypnosis failure, Buck was even more stunned and almost returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't stare at it, this magical array is weird." Heidi took a look at Buck's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
