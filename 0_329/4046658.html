The department had a long wound, and a little silvery purple blood flowed out. Even if it was only the rebound of the "heart of time", she would seriously hurt her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wound seems to have been invaded by time, recovering very slowly, and with the use of the legendary items, Natasha has been unable to stand in place. Instead, one kneeped down, the sword slammed on the ground, supporting himself, and the hands with white translucent silk gloves trembled like a coveted old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While in the air, Ketonia seems to be unscathed, but the expression is solidified, leaving the previous horror and embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a phantom is not like the wound of this world, and it quickly expands and spreads countless to subtle traces. Then, the blood splashes, Nata The holy white wedding dress of Sasha is a little reddish, like a blooming rose in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick bloody smell is overflowing, and a sigh in the mouth of Ketonia, the body is violently split, and it is difficult to fall into the ground like a rainy corpse. Tasha’s wedding dress was red again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One slammed, a badge fell on the ground, and in the center is a long river that surrounds the heart, representing the glory of the Ketonian family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badge was wrapped in blood, as if Ketonia had finally abandoned it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood with a faint wave of light, like a flowing river, constantly dripping from the badge, but it seems that it can not be finished for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, another, the "Heart of Time" sword fell on the gray gravel, and the storage bag without the legendary power was lost. The color, in a monotonous black ash, silently fell in front of Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is weak, with severe pain in the wound, but the spirit is extremely excited, and the blood is flowing, as if the soul is dissolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finally killing Ketonia! Finally revenge for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The sword seems to be easy. There is no paralysis effect produced by Lucien's "vengeance gaze". Without the "Large Big Crack" of Hathaway's mother-in-law, the other defenses and magic effects of Ketonia are removed, and it is impossible for him to hit him. In the case of attacking and attacking, you must die for nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as a golden knight, Natasha was also keenly aware that her momentum and will at the last moment suppressed Ketonia and made him a little embarrassed. With the paralyzed effect that has not completely subsided, the sword defense is slowed down a little bit, otherwise you are definitely not only seriously injured, but between life and death, luck is better, life is a little bit, and luck is almost dead. Without any means of life-saving means, death is complete death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sword, what needs to be overcome is the fear of death, the road to birth in the face of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road in the distance is quietly relieved, and the "element blessing" that is ready to go is finally not sent out. This is to prepare for the most dangerous moment. Tasha added a layer of defense preparation, how could he watch his wife die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the Lich King and the ancient mummies when they witnessed Natasha’s sword, they guessed the ending of Ketonia, he might be able to get rid of Natasha, but she didn't want to survive, so they didn't chase the Hathaway that flashed to the side. Instead, the Lich King whispered the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gemstones around its head suddenly lost color, and the thick dead gray spread out and enveloped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the dead gray disappeared, and the two legendary necroses disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Hathaway has not slowed down to escape, it will never escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien used four times of revenge gaze with uncertain hands, plus other legendary magic to stimulate the consumption of legendary items. At this time, the mental power was only half a little. But he did not waste time taking the medicine to recover slowly. Hathaway has already made a lot of money. Is it still afraid of the flame of the source? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legendary field, the gap between the two levels can have a crushing effect, not to mention the third level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the age of Ketonia, the robe of his Arcan Master is legendary second, and the power of the "Monthly Time" is close to the legendary two. Level, coupled with the uncertainty of the uncertain hand, and the joint efforts of Natasha, I am afraid that will be completely suppressed by Ketonia, can only barely save lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the dead has restored silence, still monotonous black and white gray and chaotic peaks, railroads and other things, Lucian flies to Natasha, will She lifted up, fed her therapeutic agents, and applied medical techniques to stop the blood of her wounds and restore her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri looked at the position of the maze, waiting for its effect to be lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have nothing to do with the flame of the source." Natasha picked up the storage bag of Ketonia and pointed to the truth that was inserted on the ground. The sword, the heart of time, and the shield of truth not far away, "You become an epic knight and cooperate with Hathaway's mother-in-law to kill him completely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She There is no strength to pick up any legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, quickly turned, a little bit of moon flowing, his face paler, with some feelings of demon, then left hand truth Shield, the sword of the right hand of truth, waiting for the flame of the source to break the maze, and waiting for the arrival of the teacher and the speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is to release the maze, then the flame of the source will definitely reflect the situation for the first time, and immediately use the hidden means to escape, but if it takes too long, He can also judge from time that the reinforcements have arrived, and there will be no entanglement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the maze, "the flame of the source" has given up the answer, and the face is violently impacting the maze, while counting the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, the labyrinth that twisted time and space began to oscillate and there was a sharp shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Flame of the Source" is a happy first, but the expression is once again gloomy, the time has passed tens of seconds, what kind of situation will it face after going out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of legendary onlookers? Or is Ketonia already on the verge of killing Lucien and Natasha and only need to provide their last help? !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Lucien has been promoted to the legend, and concealed, it must be fully prepared, the legendary items and life-saving means must not Less, Ketonia is still old and debilitated, and can't reach the peak state. It is possible to kill Natasha. There is almost no hope of killing Lussien unless he seduce Lucien by killing Natasha. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, this danger cannot be taken, and it is really dead by being killed by the sword of truth."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Flame of the Source" sees the time of getting out of trouble more than I expected. Maybe Ketonia fled early, so I looked at the legendary staff in my hand, the legendary robe of my body, The legendary ring in the hand, the expression became stunned: "Only sacrifice them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain in the heart can not be said, let the flame of the source have a suicidal impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. He started to commit suicide. A pure white flame emerged from his soul. From the inside out, he burned his body, and he suffered from others. The imaginary pain, controlling the progress of the burning, waiting for the end of the maze, also ignited the imprint of three legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more painful the heart, the stronger the killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, a crack in the labyrinth, began to fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solidified black-and-white gray appears in the flame of the source, and he screams, making the flame burning speed fast, letting three legendary items smash Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disintegration of the maze, Lucien did not see the flame of the source, only saw a white flame, saw the expansion stick, ring And robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien blocked Natasha behind him, and the shield of the left hand was stretched out, and the illusory colors emerged. The two were like other worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements bless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatherville’s clear sounds, countless elements Convergence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the legendary magic robe, wand, ring suddenly exploded. Red, purple, green, three different flames of different colors rolled over, Surrounded by the forces of razing, destruction, death, cursing, toxins, decay, and burning, destroying everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the shield of truth, under such a terrible storm, Lucien can only protect Natasha, unable to move forward, unable to swing the sword The flame of the source of the explosion to the center of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of faint white flames with shadows and angry screams:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't Let go of yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will put those questions into your mouth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, an illusion sounds from other worlds:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced time stop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All brilliance of black, red, purple, green, etc. disappears. Lucy is a solidified world. Only the self behind the shield of truth and Natasha can move slowly but can't interfere outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this solidification disappears, a starry starlight illuminates like a giant meteor landing, squatting in the middle of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the flame of the source is emitted, and then the roaring explosion The sound came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling explosion has a wave of tearing time and space, and it has been calmed down for a long time. Lucien is firmly holding the shield of truth. I didn't let myself and Natasha get any damage, but it had a slight gap on it, and it would be fine if it was patched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the ultimate in time and space defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Speaker, the flame of the source has died?" After the explosion, Lucien asked Douglas and Fernando, who were flashing around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect the flame of the source to be so decisive, almost let him escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently daggers, and there is little doubt: "Being my fate, shooting, it should be the destruction of the soul, but he seems to be with the dead There is some kind of connection, I am worried about the oddities, but then weird, don’t want to return to the legendary strength in a short time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To intervene in this matter, we must speed up the exploration of this place, so as not to hide the conspiracy." Fernando is worried that some members of the church will cooperate with the dead community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri flew over the other side, without any harm, she looked at Lucian with a puzzled look: "The problem in the maze?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the source has never been forgotten in the end, and seems to have suffered a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien’s mouth was pumping and he said a few unconfirmed conjectures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas frowned: "These questions..." He couldn't think of it for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have an answer? How do you build a maze without an answer?" Fernando asked loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "So the answer to some of the questions is temporarily unprovable, and being able to change the title itself is misleading thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's cumbersome or inexplicable - use magic to ask mysterious existence to get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
