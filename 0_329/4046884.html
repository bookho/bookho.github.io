			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the "City of the Sky", the white clouds, the bright sunshine is coated with a layer of golden color, no longer before the darkness of the five fingers, It seems that I have returned to the normal world from the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depths of the white clouds, the majestic meaning, the world's Rudolph II quietly looked at Allinge, long after, sighed, turned and disappeared at high altitude . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has regained the strength of the legendary peak, but if he wants to promote the god again, he still needs more accumulation and a good chance to grasp it. It is not a matter of course. And his improved method of the gods is still the path of faith, even if he has already reverted to the memory of the original Taurus promotion, the success rate is also not high, a little careless will fall into the process. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, witnessing Douglas relying on the magician’s traditional “cognitive world” to become a genius, the once genius of the magical empire’s “Sun King” tower North's inner heart has a feeling that he can't keep up with the historical wheel, just like being drowned in the long river of light at that time, vicissitudes and old, facing the new era of the new "sun", only sensational, subconscious Turn around and avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, his inner confidence is regaining the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invite us to be a guest?" "The King of the Dark Side" Ogg saw Alinhe lock up and heard the loud and loud alchemy life sound at high altitude Shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night dominates" Dracula suspended in the sky, overlooking the neat and modern Allinge, sneer: "Do you want to go?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." "The King of the Dark Side" Og grinned and directly opened the "gate" to his own half-face, Douglas has become a god Or is it a real magician class, how dare you be a guest? Slightly wrong, even running can not run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Ogg leaving, Dracula, Danisos, and the northern church Pope Berkovsky and other strong men also returned, though At this time, the "city of the sky" has no lock protection, like a lamb that has been stripped of fur, fragile and seductive, but in their eyes, it is no less dangerous than the holy city of Reims. Ground." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elves Queen" Agleia thought about it, lowered the flight height and landed at the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "City of the Sky" is just closed, the road Time and space fluctuations came from the 33rd and 34th floors of the Allinge Magic Tower. Any member of the highest judging panel who was in the main material world and did not have the ruins to escape was rushed back. One is sincere. Congratulations on the ground, and second, I want to know the mystery of the level of the gods in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien arrived with Natasha, who was also in the state of curious gods, the conference room had gathered more than half of the highest panelists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, who is accepting congratulations from Oliver, Helen, Vicente, etc., once he saw Lucien coming in, immediately stood up and smiled and greeted the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery is on..." Lucien was congratulated in the future, and was brought to the front by Douglas, giving him a warm gentleman hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't have your help, I can't help it so easily to promote the gods. Even the path of the gods doesn't know when to find them." Douglas I took a look at Lucien’s shoulder, then released my arm and thanked him sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slightly and smiled: "I just provided a dessert, and I still have a full stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Douglas understood that Lucien wanted to express the meaning, and Hathaway next to it was puzzled by this metaphor. Her literary literacy has always been bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien explained with a smile: "The Lord's study of the celestial body system and gravity is like a meal, and I found that the sun is like a dessert, not because of every After eating the dessert for the second dinner, I felt that my stomach was full and I ignored the previous meal. In fact, this is the most important reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei is indifferent, The brow is light and wrinkled, and it seems that I don’t quite understand why the meaning that can be directly expressed is why it should be circumvented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am modest and not modest. It is not a question that needs to be discussed now. I think the most important thing at present is to satisfy our curiosity. Everyone should be eager to listen to the Speaker of the Speaker, telling us the mystery of the gods." Lucien introduced the topic. On the right track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the emergency son Fernando returned Lu Xi’an’s equipment to him, and his voice was loud and loud: “Thank you for your private affairs, I only What is special about the state of the gods, what is the need to pay attention to the process of promotion to the gods, and the corresponding arcane principle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and patted In the palm of your hand: "Before, I have to ask, what about our guests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond Agraia, I dare not go to Allinge. Heathery replied coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let Aglesia come together to listen, lest she go the wrong way in the future." Here, Douglas looks positive and is basically the same. The members of the Supreme Council said, "I also hope that you will not go the wrong way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, because we were covered in fog, everyone was groping more or less. It is understandable to make some mistakes, but now the fog has dissipated, the straight road appears in front of us, and there is no reason to go in other directions. The parliament will not allow such a magician to exist." Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere was slightly solidified, but the highest panelists present did not have any expression changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After seeing the Speaker of the Speaker, you have successfully promoted the gods through the cognitive world and the half-plane, I don’t think any magician will make an unwise choice. Oliver smiled and answered, and legendary magicians such as Vicente, Helen, and Atlante also expressed their opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Agrea came in, Douglas began to answer questions about the gods, which is not much different from what was described by Brooke and Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... So far, the gods have no corresponding arcane principle, and there is no such thing as a god-like position in the system of arcane. This is what we need to study in the future. Direction is like studying the essence of magic." Douglas concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened very carefully, especially when Douglas described himself as "collapsed" in order to appear in the main material world, and even gently pick up his chin. It seems to be thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the epic knight have to change to such a state?" Natasha asked, and she was very persistent and enthusiastic about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded: "All the gods should be close to this state, so how to move to this state step by step is the main theme of the epic knight's growth, I think You should associate tempering and fighting with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first epic knight was born under the guidance and experiment of the magician, so he came from ancient magic. The Douglas of the Empire is also quite researching on this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the Elf Queen, all the strong people present have asked what they want to know, at this time all in a state of digestion and absorption, and then No one asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, Douglas stood up and said: "Is there any other problem? Then I have to continue to explore myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; chewing the "Emperor Queen" Aglecia described by Douglas just now, and suddenly felt a lot of emotions in his heart, the current magic parliament is already the strongest force to stand up with the Southern Church, a kind of god, The four legendary peaks, in a sense, are a little stronger than the Southern Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Viking is easy to play the full strength of the main material world and the "God of Heaven" with the help of "Paradise Mountain" is still at the same level . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Douglas was ready to "leave", Fernando suddenly said: "I remember that you designed the delayed selection experiment and the erase experiment before, but only because of The requirements are very high, so they can't be done. Now? Can you do it now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of magicians are stunned to see Fernando, the two experiments It is likely that the current arcane system will be shaken. If the result is not correct, it will completely subvert everyone's world outlook, outlook on life and values, and must carefully consider Lucien's "observer" theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
