			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the left hand broken arm, a wave of intense pain rushed to Lucien’s head, causing him to twitch and his head swell, painful, but the road Sean was unaffected, biting his teeth, speeding up, and instantly circling the front of the flesh-and-blood knight, escaping its giant axe and slamming into front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right right hand slammed out a punch, hit the fleshy face of the fleshy knight to cover up the face, the pong, the ferrous metal mask was slightly sunken, and Lucien’s right hand skin ruptured and blood flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant axe looked back, Lucien slammed short, escaped the blow, and then turned into a residual image in the flesh-and-blood knight. Relying on the huge speed advantage, repeating the previous scene: avoiding the giant axe, hitting the front of the body, the right hand slamming the flesh and blood, the knight's face mask... one punch, two punches, three punches, the black metal mask sag marks are more and more obvious However, Lucien’s right hand has become bloody and fuzzy. Every time he hits, there are thousands of steel needles piercing the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five punches, five punches, six punches... Lu Xien once again seized the opportunity to hit the flesh-and-blood knight, with its tall and heavy body and cold and thick The armor is a point of strength, twisting the waist, twisting, sending the shoulders, and concentrating the whole body with a heavy punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, Lu Xien’s right hand flesh and blood splash, revealing the forest bones, the black mask is falling apart, turning into pieces of metal pieces and flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the armor mask, a pale, black-faced, strange face emerges as if it were a piece of different skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist is in full swing, with the fierce and fierceness of the broken metal mask, this punching and disgusting face is smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of the protection of the metal armor, only the official knight and the incomprehensible flesh and blood, how to block Lu Xien from the big knight, full attack, especially its The head is the worst defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is quick-fixed from the very beginning, based on his own understanding of flesh and blood, preparing to face his head hard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flesh and blood splatter, the metal fragments slammed into the ground, the giant axe disarmed, inlaid into the ground stone bricks, wearing black heavy armor, flesh and blood, knights, legs Bent, heavily squatting on the ground, the broken head was deep and drooping, and there was no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina’s clear green eyes reflected the blood everywhere in the linen clothes, and the left hand lacked half of the arm’s figure, and the break was still squirming. In the blood, the right fist was exposed, and the blood drips to the ground, but he turned around in such a careless way, like a knight who had just experienced a bloody battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he really a magician?" Carina was shocked by this strong image, and the contrast between front and back was too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw that Lucien had taken a few steps and bent down slightly, pulling up the extraordinary axe with the right hand that began to recover from the wound, and then the pace was extremely fast. Come towards yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of bloody smell penetrated into Carina On the nose, she got a little dizzy on her head, and then she saw Lucien handing a giant axe to her left hand, and her right hand extended to hold the collar around her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Difficult, hard-to-repeat sounds ringing in Carina's ear, and the image of Lucien's present is like a demon summoned from the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien concentrated, just like the Cavaliers used magic items, using the will instead of the mental power to read the simulated spells after parsing the defensive collar structure, The blood force of the right hand penetrates into the key position of the banned collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of silver electric snakes smashed out, and Carina twitched slightly, but soon the slammed collar squeaked and all the pain disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch the opportunity, Lucien holds the forbidden collar and raises his hand to throw it far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In midair, the enchanted collar is closed by itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Karina's scalp was numb, she immediately felt that her mental strength recovered at a rapid rate and quickly filled the dry riverbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing that belongs to you, let Carina be full of joy, and even grateful: "Thank you, thank you..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Lucien interrupted Karena's thanks without any pity, and the voice became a bit hoarse because of excessive blood loss. "Remember the spell I read, then Use mental power to stimulate the place where the three patterns of the sun flower, the thorn tree and the zodiac are on the forbidden collar..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although intuition can be used to ban The distribution of the magic collar pattern, but after the left hand is broken, the vertigo caused by severe pain and excessive blood loss is impacting on the head of the head. It is easy to press the wrong and is stunned by electric shock, so since there is still a magician, I will Don't take that risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician, the memory spell is the most basic ability. After Lucien taught it three times, Carina can repeat it without any mistakes. Next to Adam, Alva, and Brad, they knew that their hopes of unblocking the bracelet were not urging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carina enters the spellcasting focus, calmly recites the mantra, and the mental power fluctuates and spreads, stinging to the specific enchantment collar of Lucien's neck. s position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flash of electric light surrounds Lucien. He has been accustomed to the electric shock. He has not paralyzed the past. He has been placed next to his neck after hearing the squeaking sound. The right hand grabbed the forbidden collar and threw it out. It was almost a second faster than Karina’s left hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit is like a tide, and Lucien finds that his soul and mental strength have reached the level of five, which does not seem to come from electric shock stimulation. There are many other factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time to think so much, Lucien inspired a three-ring of the soul of the soul: "medical surgery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Felipe used the experimental foundation of the Great Arcane Master "Death of the Soul" to break the relationship between the memory of the cell and the resilience of the great knight, the direct healing spells are not It’s just the uniqueness of the church. Every level in the Necromancer has more medical spells. It’s just worse than the same level of magic. It seems that there are fewer key things, so many times Also used in conjunction with therapeutic agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light flashed in Lu Xien’s left hand broken arm, the white bone began to heal, the flesh and blood quickly squirmed, and soon, the bleeding stopped, and the wound was covered with a layer of meat. membrane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Lucien started to lift the banned bracelet for Adam, and let Carina follow the study, which saved me after helping Alva and Brad. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lucine’s action arrangement, it’s best to have two assistants, and the more the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bracelet was detached, and Adam’s body was faintly faint, showing obvious signs of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, thank you very much, man! I don't know how many years I have not felt my strength!" Adam adapted to the lost blood power, I can't restrain myself from laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not have much to say, and quickly went to Alva to help him lift the ban, while Carina was responsible for Brad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While alerting, Adam looked at the broken arm on the ground with a sigh: "Man, you are really embarrassed, even let the flesh and blood knights get rid of you directly." The arm is to release the imprisonment. It is me, even if I can make up my mind, I can't do this cold and cold, as if it is not your arm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean smiled and didn't answer. If it was Adam, even if he was smashed his left arm, he couldn’t open the bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to fully understand the alchemy structure and magical composition of the banned bracelet, without the relevant knowledge, you will not be able to seize the opportunity of the short-term loosening of blood power to impact the remaining one. Forbidden bracelets, even if the left arm is lost, the bracelet of the right hand will continue to function, unless both hands are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in this way, Adam, who failed to become a high-order and completely darkened, is equal to losing most of his strength. Hands not only represent strength and ability. With weapons, or maintaining balance, maintaining high-speed and high-sensitivity vital organs, without long-term adaptation, coupled with the sudden drop in strength caused by a large number of blood loss in a short period of time, the five-level Grand Knight Adam may not be able to defeat the flesh-and-blood knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Alva and Brad's imprisoned bracelets were broken, Karina turned her head and expressed sincere gratitude: "Mr. Lucian, thank you very much. In order to help everyone get out of trouble, you lost an arm. Later we I will try my best to help you find a way to recover your arm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, when we don't say these words, we hurry to the energy!" The pain in the left hand break Still invading Lu Xi'an's head, but he didn't have much to say, he turned and ran toward the old witch magic lab. According to the usual observation, the energy room is near the laboratory, and the magic tower core is not here. On the route, Lucien and Adam did not know where it was, but it could be judged by the flow of energy between energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Carina’s concerns, Lucien did not care. Anyway, the Magic Council had the spells and rituals of broken limbs, and it was a “work injury”. As long as you go back alive, getting treatment is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, even if there is no broken limb regeneration, in order to escape, what is the loss of an arm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is doubtful that Lucien is unable to open the Soul Library and contact Rhine at the moment. It seems that this imprisoned land has blocked everything that leads to the outside world. And there is an inexplicable suppression power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, Lucien suddenly stopped, squatting down and pulling the big left arm into his waist, then holding the giant axe in his right hand. Turn into the afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit of a strange and a little horrible move that makes Carina and others slightly hairy, but time is tight, the old witch does not know when it will be discovered, I don’t know when They will suddenly return, so they pressed their doubts and followed Lucien to the energy. Among them, Adam was the fastest, and quickly rushed to the front of Lucien, who ran and superimposed his spell defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ A flesh-and-blood knight with his hands and giant swords squatting, Adam turned into a dark group and directly rushed over the giant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sword is like the air in the air, it has no effect, and the darkness completely wraps it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, the darkness faded, and the flesh and blood of the knight’s armor and body everywhere showed black signs of corrosion, only the giant sword was deliberately under Adam. No damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alva quickly stepped forward and picked up the giant sword. Adam could not use weapons, but he could not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, there is Adam, the fifth-level knight who opens the road and Lucian magic, and the few flesh-and-blood knights at the key point together with their leader- - The level of flesh and blood is easily solved, but since there is no treasure house on this route, Lucien and others have not found and have no time to find their lost magic items or old witch's collection, and they rushed to the clock. Near the energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The energy is one of the restricted areas of the Magic Tower, with a strong magical array protection, and then you will see your guy." Adam looked cautiously. In the distance between the energy, "Don't alarm the old witch, otherwise we can't stop her from being a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently Although the magic tower of each high-level magician has its own unique magical array, but on the basis of the "magic tower construction guide and one hundred and seven kinds of magic tower detailed explanation", in the "master out" Without completely opening the magic tower, the spell structure, mathematics knowledge and arcane theory are close to the high-level level. I really have the certainty to analyze and crack the magic tower guardian array. The only problem is that I don't know how long it will take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of strength alone. It is a little parsing error. When you try to crack it, you will either alarm the old witch or be killed by the high-level power of the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity, only once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is ready for action, the wind is overflowing and a huge sense of oppression arises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of darkness rushed up, and as the sound of the defeated sound sounded, Adam appeared out of shape, and he even took a few steps back. The rosy fades and becomes very pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the corner of the right hand, a two-character golem took a step back with a giant hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It blinks red in both eyes, and the whole body seems to be made of steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
