			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing the last key, Lucien raised his hands and listened quietly to the reverberation of the string in the piano room, with a faint sense of accomplishment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to plagiarize the symphony of fate, but because in the past three weeks, in addition to the time to learn magic, I put all my energy into it. The practice of piano playing, in the morning in the music library, virtual play, like Piedru, completely immersed in the world of music, rushing to eat at noon, no lunch break, directly to Mr. Victor's home and association piano The room has been practiced until the evening, and only when Victor comes over to guide, will play simple music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reward for paying, Lucien can at least barely play the symphony of destiny and is not called noise, although many of the skills are still the same. It can't be done, but as long as people who have deep knowledge of music hear it, they will definitely find the precious value of this piece of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I believe Mr. Victor is no exception. 】 Lu Xien put away his pride in the improvement of his piano performance, and stood up, because Lucien himself knew very well that this was a serious deformity improvement, but only by a lot of practice, repeated exercises and Superman’s memory. The recital of this piece, other slightly more difficult pieces of music, I still can't play, each capital needs a long time of similar pay, far less than the kind of solid foundation to lay a solid foundation, then start the difficult music The person practicing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned around, Lucien saw Feili's rich lips sticking to the flute, but did not play, ruby-like eyes staring in confusion I myself, the bright face and even the residual surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The string you played just..." Felice stopped the flute practice, and when she was ready to leave, she just heard the last string of Lucien's smoothness. Law, although the playing skills are still immature, the rhythm is still somewhat slow, but it sounds like it has a good feeling, which makes her unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien interrupted the symphony of destiny with the garbage string, allowing people to hear only one of them at a time, and whenever they want to rise When I feel it, I am often disturbed by the garbage string. Therefore, Felice and Lott in the same piano room just think that Lucien’s playing skills are improving. I don’t think he has written the music until now. Lucien bounced to the end, proficient, and a smooth breath to finish the end of the string, only to make Felice have a strong sense of contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With three days, there is only one week left for the concert. Lucien is preparing for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and I will look for an opportunity to invite Mr. Victor to "taste" himself. The music, so the doubts about Felice, did not panic, but felt just right, let them have this feeling, even if today Felice did not notice, they will find opportunities tomorrow, let them produce similar surprises . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fillis, what do you think?" Lucien showed a "sincere", polite smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis put down the flute and opened his mouth: "This...you...the ability to play is greatly improved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still doesn’t think it’s the string that Lucien wrote herself, which is attributed to the improvement of Lucian’s piano playing ability, which should be something that I have never heard before. Piano music, after all, is mainly to learn the flute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants her to have an impression. When she sees her, she smiles and says: "Thank you for complimenting, Felice. The night is coming, And it seems that there may be storms tonight, so I have to go back first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Month of Harvest" (September), the climate is still hot, Coupled with the dark mountains blocking the monsoon, the entire Waorit Park belongs to the basin, so in recent months, there is a rainstorm every few days, and today, not yet until six o'clock, the sky is already as dark as seven Eight o'clock, wet and stuffy, it seems that there is heavy rain falling at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See you tomorrow, Lucien." Felice rarely answered normally, then watched Lucien walk out of the back of the piano room, his face still emerging. Doubt, even if you have reached a conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Lott and Herodotus have left for a while, so she can't find the object of negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went downstairs and saw the housekeeper Ace commanding the maid to clean the hall, so he asked: "Mr. Ace, where is Mr. Victor? I have something to look for." Since Felice has noticed that Lucien is also preparing to advance the time, this kind of thing is always better than late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow will do." Lucien didn't know how long it would wait, so he pushed to tomorrow, and he had to go back to the magic experiment. This is the real road for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Lucien basically understood the "Arcane" journal, and used the documents, materials, books, etc. that can be opened in the library. Quickly perfecting your basic knowledge, it is the stage of rapid analysis, construction, and application of magic. For example, Lu Xien combines some knowledge of frequency and vibration to transform the sound of "Homerz's cough". The structure and construction process, after many experiments, created two new apprentice-level informal magic that did not know whether there was a mainland Magic Council headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, Lucien’s progress in soul and spiritual power is far behind the fusion of his own knowledge and magic, and his understanding of magic. The speed, which is still a little bit short, can make the spirit reach the level of ten apprentices and become the official magic apprentice. It is exactly the opposite of the general magic apprentice. This stage is the stage of rapid growth of mental power, as long as it is not a gift. Too bad, can become a high-level magic apprentice within one to two years, so the mastery of knowledge lags behind the growth of mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more dim evening, Lucien walks into Ellie When Sada was at home, he glanced at the corner of the next-door house at random, and suddenly found a new mark at the location where the original mark was erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[There is news of evil creatures...] Lucien seems to have cast his gaze by accident, and his face is invariably into the home of Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of a group of pictures of Smyr is: "Mr. Professor, the sage has news of evil creatures, 10 o'clock tonight, the original place See. Owl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[After several consecutive times without attending a secret meeting, did they finally seduce themselves with the news of evil creatures? 】 Lu Xien is eating a black bread with potato stewed beef, thinking about this thing, [will it be a trap? If so, is it the owner of the crow, or someone else? 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a long time, Lucien decided to go to the dark to observe, probably confirmed that there is no ambush, then meet with Smyr and the sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you get the blood of evil creatures, you can summon the grievances and collect the grievances of dust, and then you can make money with peace of mind, try to buy moonlight roses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[But before that, you have to prepare some items. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, Lucien’s Magic Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemy array engraved on the surface of the stone table is placed with a black vessel resembling a cup, the blue flame burning its bottom, and it There is a magma-like red liquid rolling inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked dignified, holding a 20 cm long stone pottery in his left hand, carefully stirring in the red liquid, while holding the right hand The root glass tube is slowly tilted, and the black liquid inside is dripped into the vessel and mixed with the red liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every drop of black liquid will cause a white mist, causing the red liquid to shrink and solidify, seemingly to explode, but fortunately there is Lucien There was no experimental accident with the mixing of the left hand and the precise control of the spirits on the alchemy array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black liquid is finished, Lucien puts his right hand on the alchemy array, changes its operation, a red thin line appears, and the black vessel Wrap, at the same time, Lu Xien mouth recited the curse of the scorpion, the left index finger shot a white chill, and fell in the black utensils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extremely hot encounters frost, there will be dramatic changes immediately, white fog rises, even bursting trend, but wrapped by those thin red lines, and gradually stabilized Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick white mist dissipated, and the black utensils showed a small amount of red viscous liquid. In the flow, it seemed that there was a flame burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was relieved to pour these red viscous liquids into a glass tube and seal it, which is exactly what the witch is preparing for refining. Blazing rubber." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
