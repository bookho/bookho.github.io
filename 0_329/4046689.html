			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the Holy Light, the melodiousness of the Holy Ghost, the hordes of angels, the sacred ethereal, the shock of this scene, Lucien believes that he will never forget, If you can go out alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lucien just wanted to say, sorry, I went the wrong way, it was the express delivery next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of ridiculous thoughts flashed, Lucien was unaffected, turned sharply, and the soul line screamed: "Crash!" Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, his moonlight power burst, it is necessary to close the door with this white pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the seven-story mountain light world sounded a solemn voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The demon invasion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth floor, an angel with six white brilliance wings flies out, with a hint of blue eyes in the gold Looking at Lu Xien and Rhein, I took out a small golden horn and put it to my lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious horn sounded through the entire paradise mountain, an angel who played the instrument and praised the true God, woke up, picked up their weapons, and flew out overwhelmingly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the horn sound that is both ethereal and full of fighting, Lucien’s heart whispered a "bad"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scene described in the Church of the Holy Scriptures, the horn of the judgment, the horn of redemption, and the final ruling that comes with it. The real "light of heaven"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sacred horn, the seven-story paradise hill glows brightly and spreads out as if to turn the whole world into a holy The ocean of light, the holy paradise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of light is so fast that Lucien and Rhein have to be able to cover the night and the night, and they are covered by holy tides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Light has no substance, but Lucien has not used any magic to fall into the deep sea, as if it will be radiant at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epic knight turned out to be lifted, Lucian’s many magical effects were lifted, his mental power was suppressed, and the lungs seemed to be full of “seawater”, heavy and abnormal. Every breath is difficult to reach the extreme, and the "light" is continuously discharged and inhaled in the nose, in the mouth, and in the pores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this "light of heaven" only relieved the magic effect, suppressed the mental power, and did not let Lucien completely lose the ability to cast spells and physical ability, stumbled. Opened the black door, grabbed the Rhine, and ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein is much worse than Lussien, and the black air on the body is evaporating. If there is a faint moonlight guardian, the horror is like a normal vampire prince. In that way, in the "light of heaven", it disappeared. Even so, he basically lost his combat power, his body changed, and sometimes he was physically, sometimes transparent, and sometimes bat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the "Congens Ring" worn by Lucien in his left hand, and now he has completely lost his brilliance and can no longer function in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of acceleration and flying magic accompanied by the "Big Arcane Robe" ability to buffer magic constantly, Lucien dragged the Rhine, turning into a fuzzy The figure, quickly crossed the gray hall, constantly opening the black door, no matter what strange world behind the gates, and then strange and horrible, can you compare to the paradise mountain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn of the cockroach stops, the golden eyes have a faint blue angel looking at the five companions in the sixth layer: "Chasing the demon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the description of the Holy Scriptures, he can be judged that he is the son of light, the angel of judgment, the angel of justice, the leader of all angels outside the "king of angels", close to the legendary peak The existence, and if you fight within the influence of Heaven Mountain, his strength will increase by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information proclaimed by the church, each blazing angel is a legendary third-order, three of which are close to the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four blazing angels fanned behind the holy wings and flashed from the paradise hill to the gray hall. Suddenly, the ocean-like light seemed to meet people who loved it. Change into a myriad of light spots around them, each light spot is a tiny angel, giving a praise to the holy shrine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The demon's body has the 'light of the heavens', they can't escape, only see who we catch up with them. Alvin, which direction do you chase? "An eye is like a burning flame, and the blazing sun with a red cross sword in his hand asks for fluctuations in the mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the angel of fire Clement, also known as the Flame of God, Purifying Angel, the existence of the legendary peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of eyes is like a blazing angel with a starry sky pointing to a black door: "I am following this direction."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is Alvin, who has the title of "God's Eye", "Revelation Angel", and "Angel of the Wind". It is also close to the legendary peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Clement asked subconsciously that they seemed to understand the changes in the world of the door and the gray hall, not afraid to catch up with Lucien and Rhein. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swen Junmei’s Alvin Weng and laughed: “Foreboding.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he is blazing The angel's wings swayed slightly and appeared in front of the black door, waiting for a few seconds before opening it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement did not say much, Alvin is the "eye of God", "the angel of revelation", the angel closest to the long river of the main destiny, relying on the hunch The most convincing reason, so they each tracked from other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the ocean faded, the grey hall restored peace, and it was a calm place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breathing is getting harder and harder, in the air, in the blood, in the internal organs It seems to be full of water-like light everywhere, so that Lucien realizes the feelings of the best, and is absolutely unwilling to recall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente's medical kits, advanced medical techniques, air filter bubbles and other magic do not seem to be mentally active, but Lucien only feels a little abnormal Excluded, want to completely get rid of this state, do not know how long it will take, and here is the world of dangerous doors, perhaps the next moment, weird monsters, powerful blazing angels, horrible pope chasing over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is the most precious, Lucien is lacking time now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the constant use of magic, Lucien also discovered that the "light of heaven" is invading its own mental power, suppressing it, making it difficult to operate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don’t want to control the gods at the level of the gods of heaven." Lucien looked at the Rhine around him, he has become a Only the bat, lost consciousness, all the legendary items on the body failed to come in handy, and he did not explain to Lucien how to use those equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Rhine into a moonlight bat into his arms, Lucien ran wildly, while continuing to use magic to treat himself, ten minutes, as long as ten minutes, himself You can get rid of the influence of "the light of heaven", after all, it has no follow-up power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black door opened, Lucien’s pupil slammed and the gray hall stood quietly with a holy and beautiful blazing angel, and the six wings behind it slowly rise and fall. With a faint light and a transparent breeze, the eyes are like a deep starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood here so harmoniously, and seemed to have an insight into Lucine’s actions, specifically waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel of the Wind!" Lucien recognizes his identity, without hesitation, without defense, directly recites the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge gaze!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the reaction time of one second is fatal, you must storm and find Escape the opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the attack was issued, Lucienk controlled the influence of the light in the body and immediately launched the "chaotic transmission" on the "origin" of the Holm crown ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent breeze lingers, the red light is wrapped in layers and disappears quickly and disappears in front of Alvin, the Eye of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted softly and seemed to feel the strange things that couldn’t be played out in this magic, and then he pointed his hand: “Space is forbidden!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless transparent breeze blowing in two grey halls, disturbing the space, eliminating fluctuations, and making it impossible for Lucien to escape from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!" At this critical moment, Lucien had nothing to think about in his mind, only one response! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave of light condenses into the king's scepter, and with the lightness of Lucien, all the transparent winds are broken up, and then the robe of great arcanes is inspired. On the "big break"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tiny black spot appears in front of the "eye of God", exuding a strong force of collapse and destruction, but his expression does not change at all, the six wings completely Unfolding, the sun shines through the hall, and the neutralization disappears with the "Big Bang". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reunion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien inspired the life-saving magic of the body, this is the advance The legendary magic in the soul is blessed, so it is not lifted by the light of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure disappeared in place, Lucien was ready to "reunite" with Natasha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when his figure reappeared, he was still in the hall, but only in front of other black doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This really cuts off the time and space with the outside world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointment failed to kill Lucien, at least got rid of the "Angel of the Wind" lock, the figure suddenly split, turned into a road, Sean, towards different The door ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin snorted and seduce the illusion in front of the "eye of God"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes have countless stars shining, One by one, Sean’s figure was broken, and Lu Xien, who was about to open the black gate, escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has a silver-white exquisite pocket watch on his right hand, his thumb slid rapidly on the dial, the black second hand suddenly slowed down, and the surrounding time and space slowed down significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼, Alvin snorted again, covering the entire hall of the holy wing and the breeze burst at the same time, the time and space abnormally completely dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel of destiny is also good at time and space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sigh of the wind!" Alvin seized the opportunity and sent out a magical attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue wind whistled with the breath of judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!" Lucien once again condensed the dreamy scepter and solidified a space barrier in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sigh of the wind blew above the space barrier, causing a cracking sound, but in an instant, it was destroyed, close to the third-order grade difference. Although Lu Xi’s time and space scepter is powerful, there is no way to completely resist it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a desperate situation, Lucien did not give up, cast an epic knight to transform, and wanted to rely on the sword of truth to seek a glimmer of hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, the key moment, the water-like light of the lungs exerted its negative effects, making Lucien breathe extremely difficult, and magic is a stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin seizes the opportunity, sacred and solemn: "The sleep of the wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy, The soul became heavy, and Lucien felt that his eyelids could not be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
