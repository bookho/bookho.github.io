			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several frequent out-of-controls, Aitna seems to have temporarily controlled the situation, and nearly half of the day did not let the strange black and white gray spread out, and the road Sean and Natasha have also been able to spend a fairly long half of the day, which is a rare good thing for each of them with injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the sturdy scorpion is thick, the summer is transpiration, and in the dark and dark black forest around the hills, a ray of light passes through the gap, and the dazzling light spots are reflected on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked around and smiled: "I thought we were the ones who were injured and the robbers who were attracted by the robbers, especially You still show off the money in the town, but it is so calm and a lot less fun along the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot that this is no knight And the world of the magician? Although injured, but the violet guardian armor on your body in the eyes of the townspeople, robbers, but only the heroes of the gods of blood, gods and other big characters can have, unless they eat psychedelic The things that have lost their senses, otherwise there is the courage to fight our ideas? Moreover, compared to the lure of money wealth, the beauty seems to be more attractive. In the town, there are several men who quietly follow you." Sean smiled casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha gave him a look: "How do you know that their goal is me? Call, actually built a pretty good castle in the Black Forest. Isn't Nika really on the path of the ancient magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the cluster of "Plan Black Willow" stands a castle resembling a fortress It is covered with vines and dead leaves, completely concealing the color of the original castle. The top of the spire has a preliminary outline of the magician style. In the hearts of the original magicians, the high and sharp magic is built. The tower is trying to get closer to the sky, closer to the realities of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Nika’s study of the mystery of the gods from the pattern on the monster, Lucien and Natasha were directly associated with the origin of the magician. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in the era of mythology, the age of steam civilization, the period of alien rule, such as dragons, elves, werewolves, etc., is the "madman" like Nika, human beings can be slow Slowly rising, but then they went farther and farther on the crazy and bloody wrong path, and finally tasted the bitter fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this world, under the oppression of theocracy, the germination of magic is inevitable, perhaps not only Nika, but also similar in other places. "madman". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nika has been able to move items and create fire without relying on the occasional fluctuations in mental power without learning the meditation and without any spells. This shows that his mental strength has already reached the level of the three-fourth ring magician. The magical talent is far higher than me. I am afraid that only a few magicians such as Brooke can be compared with him before the system is studied. Such genius research has been so normal for so many years." Lucien objectively evaluated the situation of Nika. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is magical talent on the one hand, and the effort and acceptance of education is another aspect. A few of Lucien’s mouths are comparable to Nika’s talents. Only the Brooke has been promoted to the legend of the magician. In the history of magic, the pioneering talents of the budding period may be higher than the Nika, but none of them can raise the ranks, but they do it in front of them. Efforts to explore the summed up knowledge, after more than a dozen generations of inheritance, some people become high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was close to the bleak and dilapidated castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One scream, a strange bird with white feathers fell on the stone pillar in front of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the castle of the wise man Nika, and no visitors are welcome." The little bird hung his head and walked up and down the stone pillar. The look of deputy pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "We came to visit the wise man Mr. Nika, I heard that he has a very deep research on the patterns and plants of the monsters. I happen to be good at this, so I want to talk to Mr. Nika."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? You are not laughing at the mad Nika?" The bird is very Surprisingly speaking in a crisp voice, "There are people who also study the mysteries of the gods. How can there be two madmen? Are you lying? Hey, I have to test you, can you identify me what bird?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird showed his wings with satisfaction: "The answer is very good, I have to ask Nika to see if he wants to see you like this madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See The bird fluttered to the window above the castle. Natasha said strangely: "Is the white feather on it should be dyed? And there is no white crow in "Big Encyclopedia"?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it is a unique white crow. Have you seen other crows dye their own feathers?" Lucien laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha woke up and smiled and shook her head: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes, the castle door screamed and slowly opened. A blond boy in a white robe respectfully said: "The teacher asks you to go to the research room to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Teacher? Are you a student of Mr. Nika?" Lucien looked at the little boy who was only ** years old. It is hard to believe that a "madman" nicknamed a nearby guy would have a student, would he be abducted? Human body experiment materials? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy seems to have seen too many such eyes, some grievances and indignation: "I am of course a teacher's student, the teacher is not the madman in their mouth, he It is a true wise man. He has an insight into the mysteries of the gods and masters the extraordinary power. They fear and fear him, so they destroy him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, no Waiting for Sean and Natasha to answer, he turned in indignation and took the two into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used the surname to check the layout of the castle, did not find the magic array defense, Lu Xien only support the left hand has been unable to move Natasha into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the rude hall, going up the stairs, it was a dark and dark corridor. Just a few steps away, the little boy who was sulking in front suddenly spoke: "The teacher is really not a madman. He is only studying strange patterns on monsters and plants, so he will dismember them. There are many animals that the hunters kill themselves and eat. They are used to blood, but they are hypocritical. The scene caused by the teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He worked hard to defend the madman Nika, trying to find the identity of two strange visitors to the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I understand." Lucien himself had done anatomy, and at the same time I really liked this little boy, really a good student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the word, the little boy’s spirit is slightly uplifting, and he said: “Those strange patterns really contain the mystery of the gods, really! Teacher I have mastered this power, able to escape the flames and snow, make people sleep, fall from the sky, stronger than those priests and blood heroes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Really?” Natasha answered with the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a question and answer, the little boy is more and more intense: "Really! I will also be a little, you see."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange monster in his mouth made a strange sound, his face became very solemn, a little magic wave appeared in front of him, and then grabbed a candlestick on the left side of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original version of the Master's hand." Lucien smiled and said to Natasha, the spell has not been simplified, or the original simulated monster language Degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it, I am very good?" The little boy proudly lifted the candlestick and saw Lucien and Natasha nod and smiled, more happy: "Teacher It's more powerful than me, and we don't have the blood of God, and there is no god to give strength. We all rely on our own efforts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher said, this is us Mankind is really strong in the future, free from the path of those false gods. Although others do not understand him, I always think that he is the greatest wise man and smarter than the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, great pioneer." Lucien looked very solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy who tried to correct the impression of the guest on the teacher was pure and lovely. After being confirmed by Lucien, the words continued to divulge and revealed many secrets. Knowing that soon, the three men walked to the front door of a beasted skin, the animal skin was gray, with a complex magic pattern on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
