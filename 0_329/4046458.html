In addition to exploring unique meditations, it is also too subversive and revolutionary. It is suddenly and completely thrown out. If you accidentally, it will explode 99% of the parliament. The above Arcanists, by the time they are not legendary themselves, have no dependence on the Magic Council, and there is no place to run in the face of the church. ※WWW.※<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, there are a series of experiments, new discoveries and new theoretical support for the determination of wave-particle duality, otherwise it will definitely be violent. Attacks, such as experiments to accurately verify light quantum, are not yet available at the current level of parliament. Perhaps after one or two years of research, someone will complete it, but now it is sure that it will be questioned and cannot be proved, such as the quality that needs to be used. The formula of energy is based on the special theory of relativity, and the special theory of relativity is subject to smashing and attacking for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien’s previous intention was to slowly put forward the findings and theories of the front, and wait for them to be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people before throwing out a few shocking experiments. And theory, and finally involved in the "wave war". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now Lucien found that the "wave war" of the parliament is getting stronger and stronger, and the opposition between the two sides is quite obvious, in order not to determine the wave-particle duality. The best way for most of the Arcans to recognize the world’s collapse is to throw a little bit of this point from now on, let them question the seeds of doubt as well, and wait until the conditions are completed. The impact they will receive will not be as strong. This process is repeated several times, even if some of the arcanes are inevitably headshot, at least in absolute numbers can be controlled, which will not cause a significant decline in parliamentary strength in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, my paper may be widely ignored, questioned, and attacked before the experiment is confirmed, but as Levsky said This is a valuable contribution... How can you enjoy the benefits without paying the price?" Lucian voice whispered vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only a consideration of human nature and three views, but also from the perspective of self-security, most of the magicians above the parliament level hang up, laughing The most happy thing is the church. They may award him a "one ton" gold medal before the death of Sean in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to the destruction of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least for now, the Magic Council is the strong backing of Lucien, and Lucien is not stupid enough to self-destruct. I hope to see the flourishing development of the parliament, even if it costs a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Heidi, who is looking forward to Lucine’s reaction to the paper, asks curiously, is it praised by Annick, or praise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Nothing. Can be included in the "Arcane" journal as a low-cost Arcane Master, Annick, you are in formal magic The teacher has a good beginning on the road. However, complacency and slack are the enemy of success. If you are a failed partner, you should not relax your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Teacher Evans." Annick answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Directly call my teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Besides the arcane and magic, Annick, who was a bit sluggish, didn't react." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliya hurriedly pushed him, and Heidi yelled directly: "Stupid, Evans teacher makes you a real student!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's stupid! I am thinking about having such a day when I am dreaming. It’s really embarrassing that he can easily get it without understanding it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick was excited. From the first encounter of Sea Pearl Stewart, he regarded Evans as a true teacher. From the teacher who is revered from the heart, it can be seen that Evans is surrounded by a halo. After the magical strength is rapidly improved, he is very inferior. I don't think I can be seen by Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am honored to be your student." Annick's cheeks rose to the most formal and solemn etiquette of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he looked at Heidi, Sprint and others: "This time you worked at the Atomic Research Institute, I am very satisfied, but not arrogant, diligent and imaginative, very in line with my requirements for students. As long as you can be promoted to the official mage, you can follow me like Annick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Heidi blurted out, excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and daggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" whispered Katrina, not the most escaped Heidi, because she thought she and Sprint gave The original impression left by Evans was not good. Even if he did not care about the same teaching, he also pointed out that he would also be admitted to the Atomic Research Institute and could not be accepted as a formal student. Therefore, unexpected surprises and strong gratitude were simultaneously surging. It made it difficult for her to restrain her emotions. Sprint also licked his lips, his hands hidden behind his back, and his body shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the parliament that inherited some of the customs of the ancient magical empire, the relationship between the teacher and the student is very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ignored their joy and excitement, but looked at Annick and smiled: "The exercises, papers, and preliminary knowledge of the ten factions prepared for you." Point refining is on the desk of my study, you can take it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啊? Annick's face immediately bitter, and the lingering nightmare came, even if he was a restrained, steady, diligent, hard-working person, still full of fear of those things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahaha, Heidi laughed loudly, his hands on his waist, very gloating, let you make breakthroughs! Let you advance to the official magician! Let you become the official student of Evans teacher earlier than us! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the same fate that may be possible in the future, if you haven’t arrived yet, don’t worry and worry for the time being! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the students left, Lucien walked to the study and found the special parchment for writing the paper. He sat quietly for a while before he raised the feather. The pen writes: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "An Inspiring Perspective on Light.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still From the perspective of blackbody radiation, the introduction of the gas theory of classical particles, the extension of the "absorption and emission of energy is a share" to the electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetic wave) that provides energy itself is also a share, and since the light is Electromagnetic waves, which are also discontinuous, but one-part, each of which is determined by its frequency, called the photon, and acts with matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After introducing the optical quantum hypothesis into the photoelectric effect, a perfect theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is obtained, and many predictions are made based on this theory, such as for a certain frequency of light, The electron energy emitted will be fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In terms of the temporality of time, light exhibits obvious quantum characteristics, and from the average of time, it exhibits wave characteristics. Maybe we should look at the wave-particle problem in a more open manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucian considered it, it still seems to be profound and profound. The discourse has been written, and even every arcane master who sees this paper will equate it with an enhanced version of particle theory—although starting with a quantum concept that is very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing this paper, Lucien published it in two copies, ready to give the Arcane Review Committee, teacher Fernando, and Alti尓, Soothe your soul with 50,000 arcane points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Alti尓 does not like the concept of energy, he can treat all electromagnetic waves as discontinuous for him who is firmly in the perspective of particle theory. One copy, isn't it a replica of particle theory? Perhaps he will also call the photon directly called "photon." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the paper, Lucien wrote to his friends one by one, although there is no precise experiment to prove it, it is from the questionable quantum From the theoretical point of view, it should not cause headshot events, but still have to remind them to avoid accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The paper I am about to submit, from my personal point of view, is the only revolutionary in all my papers that can be hypothesized with energy. Compared to the beautiful article, fortunately, there is no strong experimental proof..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
