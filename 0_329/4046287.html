			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing I can hear from my music teacher Victor is that Lucien is very happy and asks with a happy smile: "What are Mr. Victor playing?" The work?” was able to be invited to the Shenglu Hall to hold a concert at the Aalto Music Festival, indicating that Victor's work has been highly recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenton, who was showing off his knowledge to other guests on the table, saw Lucien so interested and excited, and he kept talking Tao: "A total of four works, each is a boutique, my personal favorite "C minor eighth symphony", the theme is "love". It has been innovative in the original theme music form, turned into An autobiographical work, different movements express the sweetness, warmth, sadness, pain and always warmth of love, so that every listener recalls his beautiful sweetness and pain, but it will never be mixed. Forgotten love story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the performance of this work, the entire hall and the Plaza Mayor were silent for a long time, and the applause that followed was not enthusiastic. It is full of gentle and quiet taste, it seems that everyone's mind has become quiet in love." Greenton seems to remember the girl who admired when she was young, with a gentle smile on her lips, then he Drive down the sound Dao: "I heard that this was created by Mr. Victor to commemorate the wife of his Lord's call, Winnie. It is a beautiful piece of music that he has spent more than ten years of time and thoughts on. It is a work of art that should not be missed. My heart is as great as "Destiny", "The Twilight War", "Sorrow" and "Moonlight"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful symphony, a touching love story, this It is the combination that most women can't resist. The only lady on the table wipes her eyes with a white towel. She is always looking forward to and regretting the truth: "Because there is no Master Christopher at this festival, There is no Lucien Evans, so we didn't go to Aalto. I couldn't think of missing such a moving music. It's a pity... I can only buy Music Review and Symphony Guide, then I will play the band. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also feels that the inner peace and softness, Victor's feelings for his wife, I have a deep understanding, can write this one has always wanted creation Music and received such a high rating, life for him is certainly the greatest comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice unconsciously became gentle and Lucian continued to ask: "In addition to the famous musicians, there are no new musicians at the Alto Festival. , excellent new musician?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years have passed, I don’t know Elena, Felice, Piero, Grace, Lot, Hero Dodd, how are people who are familiar with each other regardless of their friendship, and how are they still developing on the road of music? What achievements have they made? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond the famous musicians, the most impressive thing is a new female surnamed musician, her name is Louise, not only the two created The piano sonatas and the four piano pieces are very beautiful and beautiful, showing the unique delicate style of the female surname, and it seems to be a quasi-knight, raising a beautiful white wolf, very eye-catching." Greenton as a man, For people other than famous musicians, it is natural to subconsciously focus on beautiful ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t heard of it, but Aalto is the capital of music, no matter when a new outstanding musician comes out, it’s normal. Lucien thought about it, and sipped a mouthful of lemon juice before the meal: "Is there anyone else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are many, The Aalto Music Festival is always able to discover many newcomers who are buried or not yet famous.” Greenton flaunted the story of Aalto, one of the musicians, pianists, musicians he felt was good. Wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Lucien quickly lost patience, Greenton mentioned the person he was familiar with, "Mr. Victor’s female student, Lucien Evans Mr. Felice, the classmate of Mr., held his first concert at the festival, combining the various landscapes and different music she had visited on the mainland into a symphony, a piano sonata and several Piano pieces, and she also played Evans's "Moonlight" and the piano adaptation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although her music is excellent It is still far away, but it also has a certain level. According to her member of the Haien family and her good friend, Princess Natasha, it is not difficult to get praise in the Aalto music circle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded lightly. For the aristocratic girl of Felice, the most important thing in the first concert was not to fail. She can have the present performance, she must have worked very hard in recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the talented musician of the Waulite State, the lady also nodded and nodded: "Mr. Evans has created a new style of piano playing, which laid the foundation of the current piano fingering, his level on the piano. It is definitely one of the best, and "Moonlight" is his own creation. The feelings contained in it must not be completely interpreted. Yes, I think there is a big man who must have listened to Mr. Evans playing. "Moonlight"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the lady’s praise, Lucien was quite ashamed, but it sounded that Grace really came to Aalto, and There has been considerable progress in piano performance techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three men, such as Greenton, laughed after hearing the last sentence: "Of course, the Princess of the Princess must have heard. It is said that Mr. Evans has not yet gone out. The first movement was already written, and 'privately' played before the Princess Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their laughter is full of male surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cut a little steak to chew a bit, and then casually asked: "Mr. Evans has been traveling for three years, don't know what Can you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably for the past two years, no one except the Princess of the Princess knows where he is now. But at least Mr. Evans is in music. The creation of the above has not stopped, "Moonlight" is a classic, "Storm" is also an excellent work." Greenton praised the heart from the heart, "I don't know what kind of works will he bring us when he returns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a musician, more than one work a year is normal and still on the go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no music critic and music lover will demand that every piece of music is better than the previous one, as long as it is above the standard, After all, music relies more on the burst of inspiration or the accumulation of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing other guests nodding their approval, Lucien thought thoughtfully: "Whether the church has noticed that the genius musician is an evil magician At least they didn’t preach to ordinary people...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, several people talked for a long time, but Lucien never heard the news of Elena. However, this is normal. After all, she has only been in contact with music for more than three years. It is not comparable to those who have studied at Felix and Grace, and at present they are at best a good musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And John, Uncle Joel, and others have nothing to do with the festival, and Lucien is not eager to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The second, the orange-red light of the horizon slowly emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also happens to use the mental power to sculpt the last curve in the soul, constructing a complex spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible light wraps this spell model, almost disappears, and when it reappears, it has begun to orbit the Star of Destiny like other magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "Professor's Infrasound Resonance", which relies on infrasound resonance to stun, injure and even kill enemies. It is characterized by strong penetration and ability to wear. Through most of the energy and elemental defensive layers, but it is difficult to kill spells, anti-magic force field defense magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the secondary sonic energy is sufficient, Lucien is confident that it will affect the high-ranking powerhouses, but with the current four-ring strength of Lucien, it is unable to provide the required energy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The final construction is successful." Lucien's inner vision soul, watching the thirty-six ring magic, twenty-two ring magic, two Ten three-ring magic and five four-ring magic exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, "Professor's Infrasound Resonance" failed twice, until Lucien's third attempt was successful because the complexity of this magic has been Close to the five rings, if it is not for Lucien's level in the arcanes that is far superior to other four-ring magicians, there is no way to construct it so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour of rest, the knocking of the door came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo, please come in." Lucien's mental field sensed that it was Leo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo opened the door and respectfully said: "Master, it should be breakfast, then we will leave for Aalto."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
