			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮, the crisp sound came into Andy’s ear, let him wake up from the beautiful dream of the future and see a miniature version of the magic steam train appearing In front of my own eyes. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is iron grey in color, close to two people, only a long carriage, two rails on the ground, but no steam coming out of the front. Instead, like a long tentacles, the two large antennas are connected to the black wires that are erected in the air, which is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tram..." Andy looked at the monster-like thing, full of novelty and yearning, almost forgot to get on the bus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that this tram does not require the stimulation of the spirit or the will, only need to press or twist the corresponding switch, even ordinary people can drive, extremely convenient However, because the wide streets where the city of Rentt is able to lay tracks are not many and cannot be popularized, they can only be fixed in a few lines - most of the streets need to be retired one meter away from the buildings on both sides, involving the overall planning of the city. This is unimaginable work for the current Cabinet and City Hall, so they would rather promote a larger, more cumbersome and noisy public transport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, I heard the sound of the tram door coming to an end, Andy was amazed and took a step forward. Today is the first school in Brufre’s school. Heaven, if you are late, you will lose your bright future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the tram door closed, Andy happily patted the chest, relaxed, and the face once again appeared a white dream-like smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are not yet an adult, you are already doing physical work for the alchemy workshop, but you can only get enough salary to maintain your life every month, from the magic radio, The dream of the magic crystal lamp has the gap between the mountain of heaven and the abyss. It will inherit the fate of the father and the mother. It will be tiring for a lifetime, living in a place not much better than the slums, eating cheap and inferior food, and smashing the land. People marry and have children, continue the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy thinks of this foreseeable state of no change and dawn, Andy often feels depressed, if it was before, I don’t know the world. How wonderful, then you can numbly accept this kind of life, but now, from the magic radio, you have touched the outside world, broadened your horizons, and have a lot of extravagant hopes and dreams. How can you be willing to sink forever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a year ago, Martin and William quietly checked the spiritual talent and found that they were extremely weak. If there is a wealth of property support, perhaps There is hope to become a magic apprentice. Unfortunately, this is impossible for himself and others. So he entered the alchemy workshop in desperation and desperately, doing the physical labor of a slap in the face, and could not see the hope of future change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a few months ago, I learned from the magic radio that the general school and the Brooklyn school are about to be established, and I got rid of the numb mentality. Re-energized, inside, the general school needs a certain amount of property support, and he does not have the heart to exploit his parents, so he did not consider it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Brooklyn School is so close to yourself, if you can graduate from it, don’t worry about finding a job, every alchemy workshop will rush To be a true alchemist, like the dwarves you met, not only have a good salary, but also can drink and eat meat every day. You can buy a magic radio in two or three years, and you are very high-ranking, respected, and hopeful. Promotion, and will become the head of the alchemy in the future - as for the alchemy consultant, that is the position that the true arcian and magician can hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After frustration, the big dream of becoming a magician was shattered by the cruel reality, Andy lowered his hopes and had a dream closer to life and more suitable for himself. And made painstaking efforts for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't even dare to dream in the future, what is the difference between living and dying?" Looking back, Andy clenched his fist and passed for himself. I was proud of the struggle in the past few months and finally passed the assessment and became a member of the Brufley School! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rising society, an era of great change, even civilians, is full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Prime Minister of the Holm Kingdom, Russell, announced the establishment of a special police station to replace the former sheriff system. He said that this will effectively fight crime. To give citizens of the Holm Kingdom a safer and more secure life, at the same time, he also said that in order to deal with the high-ranking knights who may exist in the criminals, the dark knights who cannot control their own killing desires, etc., will judge the Knights and the Holy Cross. The Knights took some of the knights to serve as the chiefs of the police department, and equipped the ordinary police with bursting guns invented by the dwarves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blasting gun?" In the tram, many passengers repeatedly confused the contents of the radio. They have never heard of such things. Is it a long shot that can be blasted to produce an explosion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy smiled awkwardly, you don’t know, I know quite well, because it was made by the alchemy workshop I worked for, and it was invented by the dwarves there. And got the attention and improvement of Lord Evans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started from high-pressure steam rifles, combined with the current advanced alchemy explosives and simplified magical arrays, after several years of trials, finally created an alchemical dynamite The bursting gun that fires the projectile, as long as there are enough bullets and abundant physical strength with alchemy explosives, even ordinary people can use it. The power of each hair is close to the official knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this initial burst gun is not able to deal with the official knight, because the speed of the gunman can not keep up, and after the pre-installed bullets It takes time to replace the ammunition, unless it is shot by a gun, it is expected to hurt the official knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no problem with dealing with high-ranking knight attendants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are also medium and high-end bursting guns with increased magical patterns of the barrels. They have the ability to lock and the higher the power of bullets. It is equivalent to the magic longbow. Alchemy items can only be used by magic apprentices, high-ranking knights, etc., and they will be exhausted after a few rounds. Therefore, before simplifying, they are mainly equipped for middle and low-level knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy heard that Evans also developed an electromagnetic gun equivalent to a high-level magician or a Knight of the Knights, using a force to launch a projectile. Producing the speed and lethality of horror, he named the electromagnetic gun "Gauss rifle". Unfortunately, this is a high-order alchemy item. It is only used by the semi-substantial magician of the cognitive world or the five-level knight who is close to the day knight. Got it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lord Evans, the "Gaussian rifle" is likely to be used by lower-level knights in the future, but only if the research on superconducting materials achieves a breakthrough in surname development. This can be at least 50 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, the kingdom can organize a huge knight, the formal knights use Gauss rifles, the knight attendants and the ordinary soldiers use medium and high-level bursting guns, one round The power of shooting is probably only a high-level magician or a day knight to compete.” Andy fantasized about the scene and shivered excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, you must enter the workshop of manufacturing alchemy rifles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The proposal for postman and postal is being discussed in a fierce manner in the Noble House. Some members think that this is worthless and no one will use it at all. The public does not have too many distant friends, so the caravan can be completed, and the aristocrats who have their own coachmen, servants, and subordinates do not need to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The postal affairs, Andy does not understand, but the repeated propaganda in "Sound of Mystery" will shorten the distance between people, so that distant relatives and friends will no longer alienate, and can know more through letters. Unfamiliar friends are very wonderful experiences, so he also supports this. He whispered in a whisper: "These nobles have never considered the civilians, oh, except for a few good-natured nobles."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, "Before you arrive at the 'Bloofley' school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear the lady in front Sound, Andy’s body tightened and felt the hair on his skin erect , Along the front of the team, from the exit to get off, in passing flight attendant, clutching the hands of five new coins into a metal box in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five new copper coins are one-fifth of a day's work for Andy, but he thinks the tram is worth the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he didn’t have time to pay attention to the price, standing on the concrete road and looking at the bright buildings in front, the heart was unusually excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bloofley" school bathed in the sun, is coated with a layer of golden color, giving a sacred and beautiful feeling to Andy I left an indelible impression, just like a sly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloofley, my dream, I am coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning today, I will step into a new life, sparkling a life of hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
