			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the room, all the students’ eyes were concentrated on Ali’s face, but he was unaware that his eyes looked straight at the teacher, Brian, and seemed to be He confirmed that the thing just happened was not his own auditory hallucinations, not his own dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is most interested in the magic school is the illusion, good at psychoanalysis, so smiled and nodded, repeated the meaning of the previous words: " Yes, you are the best one in this grade for the entire grade. Congratulations, you will receive that special prize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali’s mind is “fried”, and the clenched hands tremble gently, and only a few words in his mind are here:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cosmic Observatory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Research Institute!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“简!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Great Stars!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ali, don’t put yourself Is the joy and learning experience shared with you?” Brian’s voice made Ali come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Ali, we are all first-time contact with the basics of arcane and magic, how can we learn well?" Some students who are from ordinary civilians like Ali They have opened their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have just entered the school for half a year, have not suffered too severe setbacks, have not had the symptoms of self-destruction, and are in a stage of eager to change their destiny through knowledge, so The miraculous ranking of Ali is rising, and their curiosity and desire in their hearts are more than awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali stood up, opened his mouth, just wanted to talk, and suddenly remembered the difficult course of this time in his mind, remembering the scene of sleepless nights, suddenly, that There was a little bit of sourness in the joy, and my eyes were sour, I couldn’t see the surrounding scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I just thought, my father is not a magician, not a nobleman, not a banker<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Not a big businessman, my talent is far less than the genius who can enter the magic school. If you want to keep up with their pace, only work harder than them, especially now is not a complicated basic stage. Lord Evans once said that at this stage, attitude is more important than talent..." Ali voice said a little sobbing, thinking of what to say, expressed a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, it is almost the month of harvest (September). The islands controlled by the parliament have not been attacked by Mardi Moss. It seems that all the energy is Put it on the inside of the integrated sea, so Brook returned to Allinge in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Atomic Universe", the complex magical array on the top of the Tower of Babel gradually approached the perfection of "waves in time and space". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ready?" Natasha was aware of this anomaly when she returned from the Nexus Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the material for the magic array and smiled and nodded: "There is a little detailing that can be completed in a few days." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the shield of truth has not been completely repaired, otherwise I would like to follow you to jump over, what the real sun will look like..." Natasha Capricorn's own chin, a very yearning look, the tone is quite regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the protection of the "Shield of Truth", her strength is not enough to fight the ultra-high temperature close to the sun, so decisively restrained this idea without risking to try, Otherwise, it is to the family, to the father<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not responsible for the subjects, after all, Lucien himself does not have much confidence, who knows whether the transmission is at the right distance Still closer to the sun, even on the surface of the sun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien humorously smiled: "This must be the responsibility of Mardi Moss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Natasha snorted: "Do you still have time to write a thesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to hurry up to arrange this magical array, Lucien has not gone for two or three months. Atomic research institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one that was written long ago." Lucien took a paper from the storage bag and handed it to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking over, Natasha curiously swept her head and read the subject: "The positrons found in cosmic rays and the presence of positive and negative particles A little inspirational thinking about the model, are you ready to submit this paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Lucien gently decapitated, "establishing a cosmic observatory After that, the discovery of positrons is only a matter of time, probably in the past two years, and against the 'Lord of the Hell, I have used the 'Yang electronic cannon, and may be seen by the Elves, see... ···In any case, this spell model is not so easy to construct.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, this is still its own unique magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the harvest, a group of young boys and girls came to the Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will the Atomic Research Institute look like?" Ali took a deep breath and said to himself, to Anderson, who just met him, he was second. The first year of the second year of general education school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Ali was talking, the corner of his eye was looking at the girl wearing a light yellow simple dress, not far away, she was delicate and slightly rolled up. The black hair is gently and gently draped over the shoulders, like a quiet and pitiful doll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Six-Star Platform, students from various schools have already introduced themselves, so Ali knows that this is his pen pal "Jane". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, under the intentional isolation of the aristocratic school teacher, Ali did not dare to speak with Jane, lest the teacher suspected, and told Jane’s father and mother that it would even be a pen pal. There is no way to do it - in the story of the bard, in the drama, and in the opera, no matter what the relationship between the noble lady and the poor boy, 99% will encounter strong opposition from the aristocratic family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Ali is looking at himself, turning his head slightly, with a soft smile on his face, which makes Ali feel excited and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, it won't disappoint you." Anderson visited the "Atom Research Institute" last time, so he is the owner of the place, however, He is equally nervous and excited. "What will the real starry sky be like..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast starry sky that carries countless legends and countless good wishes What is it like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you see when you last came?" Ali asked deliberately, lest he be suspected that he had known it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson is cheerful and slightly unassuming, so some show off. "Last time we were under the guidance of a middle-level arcian such as Mr. Lazar and Ms. Heidi. Completed the particle collision experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that visit, most of the atomic institute’s arcans were conducting their own experiments, and The secret data did not make them too close. Only the more effective arcane masters such as Lazar, Rock, Heidi and so on led them to walk roughly and did a few famous experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...···They are very knowledgeable...·The whole lab is very quiet, only the magic array is constantly lit and a slight sound is emitted...” With Anderson's introduction, the atomic research institute built in Ali's mind became more and more clear. The only thing that made him less satisfied was that Anderson's descriptions were too focused on "future style" architecture and various strange magical arrays and alchemy. The device, which looks like a high-end magic, does not reflect the style of the most cutting-edge zone in the microscopic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of the institute opened, and a noisy voice came from inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ophelia, look at this period of "Arcane"!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hello of Evans found positrons, there are anti-particles!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sigh of excitement was introduced into the ears of Ali and other students. Let them be a bit stunned. What is positron, what is anti-particle? However, it seems a bit familiar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As unconfirmed speculation, the concepts of positrons and anti-particles did not enter the textbook of "Basic Arcane Lessons", so these students only took a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne is known for his subversive theory and is currently the most legendary arcane master. His speculation has also aroused people’s attention and curiosity. Newspapers and radio stations often mention it, and together with the negative energy vacuum sea, have become the "new protagonist" in the story of the bard. Therefore, Ali and other talents are familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other places, they may be able to think of it quickly, but here is the forefront of the micro-domain, how can the nouns in the story appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since Lord Helen and Lord Oliver extended the Lucien equation to the microscopic particles of spin non-integers, let its brilliance cover the entire microscopic field, I It is known that the anti-particle prophecy of Lord Evans will be confirmed sooner or later." Lowe said very excitedly, "The possibility of the negative energy vacuum sea is greatly increased!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Reyia and Ophelia look together at an "Arcane". They understand the excitement of Lovi because they are equally excited. Suddenly, they turned to the back of the paper and they snorted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher did not mention the energy state vacuum sea model, but abandoned the description of the negative energy state, gave a new model, the positive and negative particles in the vacuum Pairs appear in pairs and annihilate the model." Chely jerked her head and tried to see the same amazed expression from the faces of Lazar, Ophelia and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reilly has read some of the content "... According to field theory and new material perspectives, all particles can be treated as different fields. They belong to The excited state of the field, and the ground state of the field is vacuum, therefore, the different fields in the ground state can be superimposed... Our world has no absolute vacuum, and the vacuum is not empty..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...···· According to the principle of uncertainty, there will be great energy fluctuations in a very small, near-determined time range. Therefore, the vacuum itself is a constant ups and downs. The energy sea keeps the energy conservation as a whole... In this process, the field will enter the excited state from the ground state. A pair of positive and negative particles will be produced out of thin air. Then, the pair of positive and negative particles will annihilate each other, releasing energy and conserving the whole... ···””<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...··· Because this process is very short and cannot be explored, this pair of positive and negative particles belong to the virtual particle, but in a specific situation or specific In the environment, the virtual particles may be separated by external forces. They are no longer annihilated and become tangible positive and negative particles. This may be one of the sources of material. Because the principle of uncertainty is based on 'empty, it is born...'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I read this content, the entire atomic research institute was quiet and abnormal. Lazar, Cherie and others were understanding the model while being shocked by the bold description of the model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously undulating vacuum energy in the sea, the emergence and annihilation of positive and negative particles, and the production of matter by "emptiness", all of which subvert their past understanding They gave them a brainstorm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the undulating energy of the sea seems to explain the source of magical energy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia, who is also good at the astrology, suddenly murmured: "The uncertainty principle that is considered a demon because of the possible subversion of determinism will be The source of our material...·······<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali at the door heard dizzy and turned to Anderson: "You understand that they are discussing What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson quickly shook his head: “I don’t understand...what are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Jane not far away shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand..." Ali's expression is very stunned. "This may be the most cutting-edge of the microscopic field..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Anderson is very recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar was reluctant to return to the feeling of shock and anger, turning his head to Ali and others: "You are here? Group of four, each group You can wait for half an hour at the 'Cosmic Observatory, Heidi and Annick are waiting for you.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
