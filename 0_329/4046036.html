			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the mission ran a few steps and finally rushed out of the area caused by the "forbidden light", but slammed into the light from the darkness of no light. The rumor, even if the fluorescence is not strong, his eyes could not help but close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of closing the eyes is very fast, and when the old man is seen to see what is in front of him, a group of yin-scented, cloudy, green liquids are already flying. I can't avoid it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" The old man’s screams screamed and swayed back and forth in the closed sewer, scaring Jackson and another one rushing to Lucien. The gangsters were subconscious and looked at the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with his eyes glared at his eyes, his skin quickly turned black and coking, and he was so painful that he rolled back and forth on the ground. After a few seconds, he slammed into the darkness. River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson and the gangster thug, stunned by this miserable scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two have done so many people to dig their hearts, have long been full of fierce surnames, in this dangerous situation, overwhelmed fear, Fiercely rushed to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retreat is a dead end, and there is hope for progress! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are twenty meters from the place of Lucien, plus the hesitation and delay just now, they ran two steps, echoing in the sewer, eccentric The voice of the mouth rang again, as if it had never disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Run! Be sure to run to the man! This way you can escape the evil magic!" Jackson and the gangster thugs at this point the only idea is this. They have never dealt with the magician's experience, and they have forgotten to throw the dagger in their hands, so that even if they don't throw it, they can scare the spells and focus on the untrained magicians, so that they can't control their mental strength, or they can't read them. Good mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they ran a few steps to see the mysterious person's appearance, the action was slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery disappeared, maliciously surging, Jackson and the gangsters gnash their teeth and rushed through the last two or three meters, puncturing the bastard. At this time, Jackson saw that Lucien’s right hand was pushed out, and a crystal ray that was braving the cold rushed out, as if aiming, could not escape. The ground hit the face of the gangster thugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thin layer of ice quickly builds up, freezing the eyes, nose, and mouth of the gangster's beater behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold gas invades the brain, making the gangster’s thinking slower, and when he finds that he has a choking sensation, he has lost his desire to break the ice on his face. Most of the power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suffocation feels stronger and stronger, and the gangsters can’t help but squat and slam their heads to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson reacted at this time, and Lucien was not the poor boy who had been bullied by himself, but the mysterious and horrible magical power. wizard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil Wizard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is not a fool, on the contrary, very clever and sharp, the ordinary face of laughter is a fierce heart, knowing that Lucien will not I let go of myself, so I resisted the urge to beg for mercy. Two steps were taken, and I held a dagger to Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson only went to the place where Lucien was less than a few centimeters away. Suddenly the body was heavy, and the body that leaned forward in the running lost balance. Planted before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" Losing balance at the crucial moment, Jackson was frightened and realized that he was in danger. He swayed his hands and wanted to maintain balance, but only The normal person, suddenly, can not make any effective move, can only be shrouded in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a expected fall, Jackson can at least try to throw the dagger at this time, and he will fall down and roll away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am very familiar with this magic mastery, it is only a slight pronunciation, it simulates the vibration, so after the implementation of the "forbidden light", the enemy who was covered by the darkness was confused, and Lucien was cast smoothly. Come out, and didn't make much noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien jumped one step at a time, avoiding the fallen Jackson, while watching his hands coldly waving, trying to maintain balance while being accurate Calmly sent his dagger to his neck and stirred it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood that was ejected was very small and very light, and the change caused by the change of gravitation was obvious. Soon the bloody petals fell to the ground, due to attention. Direction and control, Lucien did not touch the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson’s unwilling dying sorrow can’t be made in his throat, he can only lie on the ground and twitch in pain, the lotus sounds, and it ends soon. His sinful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the gangster hitter had just shattered the ice on his face, and the frozen eyes, nostrils and mouth made him slow to respond to the surroundings. At the extreme, Lucien was easily killed with a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the mission struggled in the dark river for a while, finally lost his movement, was washed by the water, and ran into the barbed wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his death, Lucien’s heart was long and relieved. Among the nine people, what they are most worried about is the old man who is involved in the evil spirits. He may have a strange ability to break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, it took more than twenty seconds, and the dark areas caused by the forbidden light had not dissipated, covering the ramp, the dark river, and the barbed wire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two beggars who were stabbed by their companions were writhing on the ground and have not lost their lives for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggars and gangsters in the dark river were scared by this mysterious and magical wizard, desperately trying to find barbed wire and fleeing into the Belém River. However, they fell, they have lost their way in the dark, left and right, and can not find the water inlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien started to work, he already thought about it, there were too many other people, and he was very likely to kill it. He could only force the rest of the people to leave the water inlet. There are water ghosts outside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, pinning hope on the water ghost is also a must for Lucien, after all, the magic that he can continue to cast is limited, and the only range of surnames in informal magic Attacking the magic "Homerz's cough", he has not yet learned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien also tried to get rid of all, so the "light ban" was to cover the dark river with the water inlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering that two people in the dark river could not find the water inlet, Lucien began to feel that things are moving in the best direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is also a problem, that is, Lucien himself cannot see the specific position of the four people in the dark area of ​​the forbidden light, and can only rely on mental strength. Sensing, can't attack with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting for the dark areas to dissipate, Lucien took the time to regain his mental strength, a "runaway ring" to be one and a half of other informal magic, plus On the display of "forbidden light", "acid splash", and "frost ray", Lucien is now able to use one of the least labor-intensive "acid splash" and "frost ray". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Times and seconds passed, after Ska hit the wall, he changed his direction anxiously, and he ran and ran, his eyes jerked. Let him couldn't help but close his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he opened his eyes, he immediately scared his feet and fell to the ground softly, whispering and praying: "Lord, forgive my sin, Rao Let me, spare me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because he saw twenty-seven meters away, the gloomy evil magician who shines fluorescently, it seems Have a young, handsome face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of danger, some people choose to fight and fight, and they will fight hard. Some people will choose to plead for mercy and give up resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental state of Lucien Seeska is close to collapse, and when the heart moves, it is necessary to display the "eye of the stars", this informal magic, mainly hypnosis and let People play two roles, the spelling is very fast, but the time to produce two effects is different. The latter only needs to be contacted by both eyes, it can be completed, it is very helpful in the battle, while the former requires nearly ten seconds of eyes. Contrary to the success of hypnosis, and if it is to drive the other party to do things that they are very reluctant to do, the other party is easy to wake up, far less than the "magic enchantment" in formal magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
