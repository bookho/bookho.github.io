			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flying" was classified into the astral system in ancient times, and in the Magical Parliament, it belongs to both the force field and the star system, because its principle of action is offset by the influence of stars. The bondage of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling of flying is really good." Lucien closed his eyes and felt the cold wind blowing from the face. It was a kind of smoothness that got rid of all the restraints. Pleasure, "It’s a slow speed. You need to calculate the angle and direction of the gravitational pull of your own. It’s really a painstaking mental effort. You must have a magical array of auxiliary calculations. And before the six-ring high-order flight, you haven’t The approach is as fast as a magic steam train, not to mention the airplane and supersonic speed. Well, use fluid mechanics, aerodynamics to optimize it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in In the middle of the flight, Lucien’s ear suddenly sounded a calm male surname: “Mr. Respected Level 4 Arcanist, you violated Article 7 (18) of the Aringe Regulations: 'Unless you get permission from the Magic Council , can't fly in Allinge'. Do you pay a fine, or go to the escaping prison for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Lucien seemed to have opened his eyes as if the dream had been awakened. Some of them looked blankly at the young man wearing a black battle mage robe. He was black and brown, with a serious expression, and a simple and smooth robes with four rings of magic. The division badge, the red flame badge symbolizing the battle mage, the black scepter badge representing the internal disciplinary status of the magician, and the white feather badge of the permitted flight, but due to the execution of the Allinge mission, they did not wear the Arcane badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, learning to be too excited after the flight, forgetting that Allinge banned the flight... Lucien came back and realized that he had made a big mistake. I couldn’t help but lick my forehead: "How much fine do you need to pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the property that only has 61 or so arcane points, Lucien is very There are wealthy temperament and ask: "If you go to the banned prison, how long will it take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man saw Lucien no rebellion, serious expression slightly Relief: "Mr. Arcanist, here is the southwestern outskirts of Aringe, which is much lighter than flying in the heart of the Sky City, and you are the first to commit, so the fine is 30 arcane points, if Go to the banned prison, you have to close for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One month? Well, I pay a fine." Lucien made a bit of a painful decision. Just celebrate the promotion of the middle stage and put a big fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man wrote a penalty with a magical paper and stamped his identity badge: "Mr. Arcane, you take it to discipline The Ministry paid the fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he smiled and glanced at the fantastic ring of Lucien’s right hand: "Mr. Evans, congratulations You are promoted to the middle level and become another magician who has advanced to the third ring before the age of 22. I think that before the Sixth Ring, you will not have any difficulty." The unique shape of this ring has long followed magic. The tabloids circulating between the divisions are known to the majority of magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I am still under 20 years old. Of course, if I count the age of my life, then I am twenty-five years old... Gentle and laughed: "Thank you, you are the first magician to congratulate me on promotion. Right, I don't know your name. Can you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The war mage laughed humorously: "Of course, I am not afraid of Mr. Evans, you are retaliating. I am Yurisian of the Song of the Silver Moon, and I am currently affiliated with the Correction Department and the War Mage Division. After the magician saw through the eyes of Allinge that he violated the flight regulations, he was a four-level arcane master. He did not dare to deal with it himself, so he reported it to me.” He then saw the Holm crown ring “element” before deciding to pass. The Linge magic array teleported over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ulysian? The genius of the electromagnetic system of the genius?" Because of his genius in the eyes of others, Lucien was Lazar, Rock, etc. The friend instilled a message of the genius of this generation of magical parliament. Yurisian, a four-level arcane master, almost won the Silvermoon Medal for his discovery of photoelectric induction, but he was a wonderful fighting madman who applied to join the Warfare Division and the Disciplinary Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian laughed and laughed at himself: "How can I call genius in front of Mr. Evans? In the hearts of most young magicians, this generation is really There are only two geniuses, one is the two immortal throne awards, one Holm crown award and promoted to the high-level Mr. Felipe, one is Mr. Evans. You have to say that your appearance The high genius 'assessment standard' does not seem to be a true genius without winning the highest honor in their respective fields. So I, Rachel, Arthur, Samantha, Larry, etc. unfortunately Ordinary magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few words, Yuris Ann started the Ariel's magical array with the black scepter badge and disappeared into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the penalty in his hand and shook his head and smiled: "Now there are 60 arcane points subsidized in one month, barely able to cope with abnormalities. The cost of life, experiment, and pharmacy, but if you think that the second-to-three-rings are full of medicinal materials every month, and magic materials don’t cost money, you can’t do anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Suddenly regretted why you want to purify the magic array, otherwise there will be the first monthly annuity payment in July. According to the current promotion and sales of Holm Minerals and Harvest Company, how should the first few months in the first few years? There are hundreds of Jintales, etc., which are fully promoted in these countries. It is not impossible to have five or six thousand or even ten thousand Jintal every month. It is equivalent to a high-ranking magician."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receive the penalty, Lucerne slowly descends while looking at the darkness to the west: "Natasha, John, Uncle Joel, Eliza, Victor , Elena, Felice... I really want to find a chance to go back and see them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; When Lucien slowly descended to the height of the second floor of the villa, a bang, a window opened, and Lei Yiya and Heidi squinted out the window. They are too tired to sleep, but they want to see the beautiful night sky and recall the story told by their mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After home, away from loved ones, come to Allinge to learn magic, heavy homework and spellcasting exercises, the feelings of missing are always unable to resolve, they are not like roads Sean can also communicate with Alta's Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Mr. Evans?" Just opening the window, Heidi saw Lucien, who was floating next to him, and he was preparing to return to the meditation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Good evening, Heidi, Lei Yi Li Ya. Why, can't sleep? Do you want to practice a set of arcane exercises?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two little girls who had been stupid were suddenly very embarrassed, couldn’t help but take a step back and laughed: "In fact, we are coming to close the window, we must Otherwise, it is too cold to sleep. Mr. Evans, happy new year, I hope that you can become a mid-level magician in the new year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words of wishing perfunctory Sean, Heidi and Reyaliya slammed the window together, but after two seconds, the window slammed and opened again, and the two pink freckled little faces lined up, staring at them. Lucien, staring at his feet without stepping on anything:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, you, you become a mid-level magician? Do we Have you slept for a year?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After two weeks, Lucien built the "Infrared light of Lucien" in the soul. Tricyclic on "and" Maskelyne Star "this" book astrology and the elements of the "unique magic, reinforces its strength, this replacement tower magic magician went to A Line badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, Lu Xi’s soul has built a total of twenty-seven magical rings, sixteen two-ring magic, five three-ring magic, The advanced three-ring magician is 20% more, and the most different is that in addition to flying, Lucien's other three three-ring magic is unique magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magician management department, Eric’s stiff face is still a suspicious smile. He extended his hand: “Congratulations, Evans, just one In the years to be promoted to the Third Ring, it is worthy of the name of genius. Even with the help of magical pharmacy, it means that you have a very solid ability on the basis of mathematics. Generally speaking, there will be a high-level magician at this time. Or the Archmage will accept you as a student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your reminder, Mr. Eric. But it is not certain, at least except for the stars and elements. I haven't figured out the rest." Lucien shook hands with Eric and handed the magician badge over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric looked at Lucien’s magician badge and reminded him: “Evans, you are promoted to the middle, and the magic badge can be a constant magic. Effect, what do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Eric, can you choose other rewards without constant magic effects?" Lucien has "elements" The ring is on, and the constant magic effect on this medium-level badge is not valued, so I asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is often encountered in arcane masters with good magical items, so Eric is not surprised, the official business asked: "Evans, you What rewards do you want? Can't exceed the value of a constant magic effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
