			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of the thousand lakes, the remains of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the Black Forest, Douglas did not immediately go to the place where the "Aringe" was buried, but waited with Ann Arnold and Fernando for Rentent The news in the city only knows the strength and intensity of the church's counterattack. Knowing the ending of the "dark blue demon" Sharp, he can study the "city of the sky" with peace of mind, lest the magician who was in the party be arrested, "Aringe" "The leak - it crashed there, there is almost no way to move away without causing big movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President, "The Heart of Time" Ketonia left the Glorious Cathedral and returned to his villa in the city, and the church did not arrest 'dark blue Demon's." A magician reported to Annod about the situation in the city of Rentatt. They could not install spies inside the church and the big nobility, so they could only find out the superficial things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod licked the white beard and nodded lightly: "Kotonia has known the matter from Rieg and will definitely tell Franz The church did not say that execution of Sharp, even the arrest and interrogation did not proceed, very surprised, it seems that things have changed, perhaps the consequences of the battle between the Pope and the 'Silver Moon'..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He analyzes the reasons, and it is because of the distance between Aalto, Tria and Lance Arranging the divine array that transmits the sound information, so the information is limited, and the analysis cannot be made, so it can only be judged underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what the reason, at least the church has compromised this time. Compromising the nobility is important to fuel their ambitions." Douglas has a calm expression, I don't know it. Still looking forward to saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I said that the church will be good for us whether we kill or kill Sharp." Anord said with a smile, turned to look at Fernando. "You don't want to." Going to Old Green, Sharp should now know that we are using him. It is the time when anger is difficult to stop. Let’s talk for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here He smiled very narrowly and said: "Fernando. Earl of Pefus is just in Rentat. You can ask him, want to understand where the status of the nobility comes from, and think about how strong the nobility is, no matter what." Look at the situation in Alto. Find out the results of the Pope's battle with the 'Silver Moon'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. The source of intelligence for the nobility is much richer than them. Don't ask them to ask, who to ask? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count of Pefors?" Fernando snorted and frowned slightly. "You have to change that belt again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod smiled and said: "How? Is it very repulsive? I think you were very interested before, still In the study of how to improve the belt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando laughed twice: "Life is relatively short-lived, so why not try more in limited life? "Different experiences?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the fun experience will be bored, only the mysteries of the world and magic can be forever fascinating." Douglas is not aware of the denatured belt. Things, so they express their own opinions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annodhaha laughed twice, and no longer said anything more elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet, the villa of Count Pfefors comes and goes It’s like a daytime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight came tonight, and left the night, exchanged information, confirmed his attitude, did not stop, Gain tonight What happened was too shocking, so that they had to panic and give up the rest. Who would like to get the Duke of Sharp to join the magician to assassinate the cardinal Alfonso? Who would like to get the message of Lord Ketonia in advance, intending to kill all the magicians? Who can think of it, but the name of the "Heart of Time" of the prestigious name has fallen into the trap, almost fallen, and suffered the most painful defeat after fame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a thing will inevitably set off a hurricane, just the end of the wind sweeping, will let them ordinary aristocrats lose everything, so how can they not I don’t want to look for my own lord and higher-ranking nobles to explore the tone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a few subordinates and aristocrats leave, the face of Earl of Perfus showed deep exhaustion. For a knight like him, it is nothing to stop for a few nights. It is absolutely impossible to be tired, he is tired. It is the soul. We must analyze the attitude of the church and the attitudes of other great aristocrats according to the information that changes from time to time, and constantly adjust our position so as not to encounter any unexpected events in this storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Lord, since the church sent the Cardinal to appease the Sharp Master, things do not seem to have any bad changes. This is the grace of the Lord. The demon's conspiracy could not be achieved." The last nobleman in the living room was bowed and ready to retire. He was the confidant of Count Pefus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the confidant, Count Pefus did not hide his exhaustion: "If it wasn’t for Tria and Lance, there would be a big fight, maybe the result would be great. Different, we are strong and weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobleman who was sympathetic to the last sentence of the Earl’s adult sighed: "Yes, Earl, The compromise of the church made us feel our own strength, but the real reason for their compromise made us understand our own weakness. If, if the king left them to defeat the coalition of magicians, vampires, dragons, elves, etc., we... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he was a little scared, afraid that the night watchman was hiding nearby, so he did not go down and silently left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Perfus looked at the slowly closing door, and his mind was ups and downs, like the tidal wave above the endless ocean, without the enemies such as magicians, vampires, etc. What is the need for the church to "raise" the nobility and respect the nobility? In the past 100 years, changes in the attitude of clergy have shown everything! As the pretty hot female magician said, the enemy of the nobility is a magician, and the status of the nobles is also from the magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he turned his head sharply and looked out the window of the black scorpion, and lowered his voice: "Since it is here, come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The master allowed, I can come in." The slightly magnetic low-pitched female voice rang, and the glass of the floor-to-ceiling window bulged inward, as if a transparent person had to drill out of the blisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very soon, a petite beauty dressed in a red magic robe walked out and the glass was restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the bright girl, Count Pefus did not have a smile, but rather serious and dignified: "What are you doing?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my intention, you will not know? I remember you are not such a fool?" After becoming a woman, Fernando felt that his irony was relatively It's even softer. "We talked before. Now I want to know, is your doubt unsolved? Do you want to understand where the status of the nobility comes from? Think about how powerful your power is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Paphos is a unique golden erect, like the Golden Dragon, he looks at Fernando and slowly says: "The answer to the question is not important. What matters is that you are too Weak, even if the 'death lord' recovers, you are also weak, and I can't pursue the chance of failure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocratic status and power issues He had doubts before, but things tonight made him completely clear. However, they understand go understand, he did not intend to share with mages, bluntly pointed out the core issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this attitude, Fernando is very satisfied, at least indicating that Count Pefus is willing to communicate with himself and others. This is a sign of cooperation, he smiled. Like a bright light, a room shines: "We are weak, but the coalitions of magicians, blood races, dragons, elves, etc. are not weak. If the nobles are centrifuged again, the church can only protect themselves. Of course, we don't need it for the time being. You are adventurous and cooperative, just hope that you can get a little help, let us have time to grow, and by then, you will find that we are no longer weak enough to cooperate with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The magician is not as powerful as the clergy." Count Pefus is undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando felt the concern of Count Pefus, did not continue this topic, and asked: "I just heard Tria and Lance happen. "War?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Yes, Silvermoon, Abel, Dracula joined forces to attack the Pope..." Earl of Pephos indulged, The news that I understood was originally published. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
