			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [Www.biquwo.com], this site provides you with free novels for free reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes are closed and I feel again The fascinating "the vast starry sky" came, it was so detached, so broad, high on the ground to watch everything, indifferent and timeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is projected into the cognitive world of Lucien's semi-curing, "instilling" into the inexplicable force, making the whole environment more and more clear, more and more real Like the real world, at the same time, it also makes the glory of the star of the destiny to ignite a raging "fire", and constantly "gathering", like a real "star", and that The group seems to be able to devour all the darkness and also emits a little terrorist attraction, which has re-established a new balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse electron cloud, the exchange of charged particles of virtual photons and the electromagnetic forces they symbolize are also getting closer and closer to the "real existence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strange sensation, Lucian’s cognitive world is evolving toward solidification, and is moving toward the state of legendary peaks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien did not concentrate on maintaining and observing the changes in the "cognitive world", but suddenly opened his eyes and seemed to want to look around The "real world" that has never been discovered, provides the "real world" of feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are other legendary magicians and epic knights who know, they will certainly not be able to laugh at them. From knowing the phenomenon of "real world" feedback, the past generations are strong. They are looking for it in a deliberate way, trying to master it, because it definitely contains the most essential and core mysteries of the world, but whether it is below the legend, or the legendary peak, even when Tanos and Viking are promoted to the gods , did not capture any traces of the existence of "real starry sky (world). Except for the huge "feedback". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is considered a secret that can only be touched when it is promoted to the true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes open, the glare of the line of sight seems to be covered up, and it’s dimmed a lot, and the surrounding is clear and illusory. Innocent, star-studded universe, transcendental, invisible universe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "real world" that has always been providing feedback and making people feel illusory is presented in front of Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any legend or class god, it is certainly difficult to restrain your own horror, but Lucien seems to have expected it, but his mouth is tilted. Showing a very light smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his right hand. The surrounding starry sky that could not be touched and could not be touched suddenly changed. Constantly from far and near, from small to large, from the river system, the galaxy to the familiar azure planet opposite his palm, and behind the azure planet. That huge "fireball" is looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien recognizes that the world is solidifying faster. The burning of the main star of fate suddenly burst into a dazzling and mighty light. It seems to be a little bit "in the void" and wants to complement the big fireball in the "real world"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Azure Planet" disappeared, "Big Fireball" occupied the entire "real starry sky". It is so huge, so majestic, so bright, yet so illusory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the Atomic Research Institute from the Cosmic Observatory, Ali, Jane, Anderson and others have been in a state of paralysis. They are really in the starry sky, seeing the universe, witnessing the discovery of new particles, bringing tremendous shock to their not mature hearts, and realizing that The vastness of nature feels its own insignificance, and the awe of the arcane knowledge that can explore the universe and micro-secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Ali does not secretly look at Jane as he did in the past few hours, trying to find the opportunity to communicate with her, but with Jane. The expression stood in the corner with confusion and excitement, and looked at the companion with a focal length and went to the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn is crisp, the sky is extraordinarily blue, and in the middle of the sky, there are two rounds of bright sun with a slight glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two rounds of the sun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali said suspiciously, then, He suddenly realized that his voice was high, and he shivered with a sharp trepidation that he had never had before:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, two rounds of the sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in the "Atomic Research Institute" looked at him, not knowing why he was so excited, even more incomprehensible what he meant to express, even though he spoke out every word, they all know . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a gentleman, no, which one knows the world is semi-cured?" Chely has been dressed up by a married woman. I remembered the possibility of two rounds of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar immediately walked toward the window and shook his head: "It is impossible to be semi-cured in the cognitive world, there is no change in the surrounding environment, neither electricity Flashing thunder, there is no elemental spot convergence, except... two rounds of the sun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s low voice, his eyes fixed on the sky, there really Two rounds of the sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the semi-cure or solidification of the cognitive world, according to the records of magic books, it only affects the environment around tens or hundreds of kilometers, resulting in vision Unless it is a very special situation, such as the heterogeneous space that was discovered before, it will be seen by almost the whole world. But this time, the two rounds of the sun are almost inseparable from each other, obviously it is impossible to be different in the atmosphere. Like! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it is near the sun, the scope of this vision is too great! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar's credibility is obviously much more than Ali, and Cherie, Lovi, Ophelia and others all flock to the window, look at the sky, then one piece The sound of the cold breath sounds, there are indeed two rounds of the sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on..." Ali was shocked and stunned to ask the famous Arcanists around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar, Jerome and others are in silence, they also want to find someone to ask this question! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they are able to distinguish the difference between the two rounds of the sun. The left wheel emits light and heat, dazzling, and the right wheel is like an illusory image. , almost real illusory images. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In general, something has happened..." Ophelia has never seen this phenomenon in herstrological records, so it is a bit difficult to control at this time. Yourself. Subconsciously muttered to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the vision of the two rounds of the sun in the sky, apart from making the sun clearer and more thorough, did not cause other changes, so the whole Aringe, only a few accidental The talents who have come to the sky have discovered this dreamlike situation, and the various things they have caused have caused people around them to follow the strange landscape of “two days in the sky”, but no one knows what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Wicken was originally listening to the report of the distant Melmos, thinking about how to contain the problem of "Hell Lord" Maldi Moss, the soul of the fate "Suddenly, let him flash to the window and look up at the sky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of the orange red. Two groups of fireballs like the sun rise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Even if Viken sees it again. Such a scene has never been encountered, and it is difficult to judge what happened in the end until he picks up the Platinum Scepter and uses prophecy. It’s a bit stunned. "Lusien? Evans found the sun? He hasn't studied the 'Blue Gate' carefully..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already understands this is Lucien Discover the sun. Get the "real world" feedback, so as to promote the vision caused by the legendary peak, but his half-white eyebrows can not help but wrinkle: "There is no possibility of two rounds of the sun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Normally. It should be a bright "star" next to the sun, a star that can't be seen without paying attention, a star that will be covered by sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
