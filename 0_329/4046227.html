			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerald green is like a piece of leaves with a long skirt, fresh and refined, but Ellerstin’s expression is not the case, her face looks like Lucy Grace: "Mr. Evans, how is your analysis of the two sacred techniques of 'thorns' and 'bumps'? I see that the other arcades of the research team have made progress and started to combine the cultivation of oats, Peas and other foods to find a simplified method. Do you have a Holm crown award winner, the famous 'elemental order' is not as good as them? It is said that there are many middle-level arcans!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is almost questionable, and she suspects that Lucien is either a perfunctory procrastination of her brother and sister, or she has no ability to match her reputation, but a guy who gets the Holm Crown Award by luck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodore and Yurian are wary, worrying that Exeter and Elstin will suddenly get out of trouble and get rid of this "Arcane Research Group" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the glasses with the chain on the side of the gold wire and replied "Meticulously": "Princess Ellerd, because of the magical mark you provided It’s not complete, so I’m slow. Other middle-level arcians can start planting experiments so quickly, perhaps the Druids that their team is responsible for have a 'good arcane talent' that can draw a complete picture. The magical imprint, do you think this is the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language is ironic but it looks like serious and unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even so, you won't be a clue as a Holm crown winner!" After a few seconds of dumb, Eck Silion still asked unwillingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fearing perfunctory suspicions and arousing the suspicions and strong rebounds of Exeter and Elstin, Lucien put his own mathematics-based papers up, I answered very seriously: "Of course, I have solved some of the principles in the three-day study. 'Thorns' stimulates the interior of shrubs and directly simulates a few elements with the energy of the gods to promote plant growth, and 'the source of harvest' It is to stimulate the plant cells while extracting the nutrients in the soil to supply it, so that the soil loses a lot of nutrients but cannot be replenished. Therefore, the former consumes your natural heart and the power is small, the latter is less, the former will not damage the soil and the latter will." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for which nutrients or elements to extract, because the magical imprint is not complete, I can't figure it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, have you resolved to this extent?" Although I was questioning before, but after hearing the answer from Lucien, Elstin and Exeter are still not quite convinced, relying on not Complete divine imprint and only This principle will be constructed for three days and two divine spells have largely been resolved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "You just didn't question my Holm Crown Award for luck?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the two emperors were sent to perfuse the two elves, the data of other research groups came to Lucian in secret, even on the second day, the three Arcanists and Lavindi The authoritative high-level arcane masters have solved the construction principle of most low-level magical techniques, and began to concentrate on sensing and exploring the so-called "natural will", analyzing what it is, what constitutes it, and why it responds to the druids. Ask, why can you provide magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a difficult and esoteric topic, so the task that Malfurion requires - using the principle of parsing to build magic and simplifying the alchemy that can be popularized in refining The items were handed over to other high-level arcans and mid-level arcans. Otherwise, this kind of project can be undertaken by several Arcanists, and it can be carried out in secret. It is not necessary to draw so many Arcans to cooperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analytical principle of the structure of the gods makes Lucien affirm that the elements of the common plants in this world are still nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. The needs of magical plants are complicated. a lot of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, since you figured it out, why don't you tell us?" Blocked by Lucien, Exxon quickly shifted the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked puzzled and puzzled: "Because I solved it last night, I haven’t had time to tell the two. In fact, even if you don’t come, I I will also go to you, and then we will go to the field to conduct experiments to determine what kind of elements are needed for grain growth such as oatmeal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magical imprint is incomplete, and Lucien certainly does not directly tell them which elements are mainly, and the planting experiment is time consuming and is a necessary choice for procrastination and perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien handed out an acre of fertile land and ordered: "Mr. Theodor, Mr. Yurian, trouble you to determine the content of various elements in the soil."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic for determining the elemental content is the second ring. Theodore and Yurian are the battle mage. They are not built in the soul to assist the magic experiment, so when they release, they need to read The mantra needs to use the corresponding purified elements as the casting material, and it takes nearly two hours to record the various elements of the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we have only found sixty-seven elements, we can only measure these, and there may be elements that are needed by plants such as oats but that we have not yet discovered. "Lu Xien, as a "qualified" arcane master, naturally wants to explain the experimental premise, and then told the farmers to plant oats according to their years of experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the farmers are busy, in the steep cold wind, Lucien is facing the two elves: "His Royal Highness, Princess Royal Highness, you are trying to spread the source of the gods." To allow these oats to germinate and mature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A faint green light flew out of Ellestin, covering the land. It didn't take long for the oats to grow out of the seedlings. Then Exxon and Ellersten alternately displayed two "bumper sources", and finally let this acre of oats really "bumper" in ten minutes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the trainee's druid must use at least one month of apprenticeship to achieve this effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Theodor, Mr. Yurian, please measure the content of each element in the soil." Lucien is the head of the experimental team. Naturally, there is no right to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the busy Theodor and Yurian, looking at the harvest of oatmeal, Ellerd is somewhat confused and hatefully said: "I don't object Humans are hunting for survival, but since you humans can grow food and have food to survive, why do you want to eat animals and eat meat? Every year, a large number of cute animals that have not yet entered the natural circulation are shown off by you. The surname kills, let them decrease day by day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she looked at Lucien with a serious look: "Mr. Evans, you are not incapable of buying Bread and vegetarian food, why eat meat? Without you, people who enjoy eating meat for the last name, many animals will not die a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean is absent-minded: "Because our body structure and elves are different, and most of the meat is raised in the estate. In addition, if any animal is on the verge of extinction, please tell me, I will promote the protection of them, this is not Because I have pity on them, In my case, besides the intelligent creatures, unless I have been feeding, there will be no similar emotions, but to protect the biological diversity of the surnames and indirectly protect ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ayerstin understood most of the words of Lucien's "nonsense" and completely desperate for him: "In short, you are not willing to give up the desire to enjoy the dirty."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer, but looked at the harvest of oatmeal in front of him. The vast majority of the world’s human beings can’t even eat enough, and survival and development are the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Malfurion, the elf druid, Lucien is very fond of it, just because he wants to find ways to increase food production. It is a matter of appreciation, as much as the church’s overthrow of the ancient magical empire that enslaved mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is cautious and careful, taking his own strength and safety as the most important, but under this premise, this feat of saving countless people is still Both hands and feet agree, from the heart of admire, and are willing to make their own contribution to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the words of the last life, this is called merit, and Wanjiasheng Buddha." Lu Xien himself teased a sentence, and let the underlying society enjoy magic. The benefits are also a good way to shake the foundation of the church's beliefs, although it is slow and inconspicuous, but it is real. At the same time, the increase in grain production is also a good thing for the aristocrats and magicians who own the manor to increase their wealth. No one will refuse. "According to the rules of the Magic Council, this will probably bring considerable and steady income to the founders. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this magical world, Lucien is not used to the change of living conditions, except for the better in Aringe, there is no other on earth. Convenient and colorful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have the ability, you don’t have to say it, but if you are strong enough and don’t reveal the secret, then why not try to promote the development of human society and let the world want it. What is the direction change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
