			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the "death lord" did not immediately attack, determined the position of "God Angel" Franz, he retreated to the dark outside the room The place, waiting for the night and the day to alternate, waiting for the moment when the church door opens, it will be Franz's most relaxing moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the spell is cast now, Franz is likely to have a dangerous premonition and make a defense in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while fighting in the church, he has not recovered his peak, he has no victory over Franz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is the cathedral of the "God of Truth", the long night shines, and there are many darkness that cannot be reached by light. "Death Lord" Tananos Standing among them seems to be integrated with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall where the transmission array was arranged, Franz stood up and waited anxiously for news. Others may not know, but he understood very well. In the evening, there will be a result that is related to my future. No, it will also be the result of affecting the whole world situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred light in the transmission burst suddenly shines brightly, and the whole room shines brightly as white, and the breath of magic masks everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a result?" Franz's eyes squinted at the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the darkness, two red rays flashed and the "death lord" Tananos was keenly aware of an excellent raid opportunity. Fluctuations in the transmission array can mask all traces before the spell is sent, especially Franz's attention is all on the receiving message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his right hand, and the long black sleeves of the magic robe naturally retracted, revealing a dry palm like a pale palm that lost all its moisture. Every inch of skin is different from ordinary people in every inch of the skin. It is mottled with traces of death. It merges into an undead rune. The faint black air emerges, and the strong silence appears, just like the country of the dead is re-expanding under the palm of this hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tananos bends four fingers, keeps the index finger, and the withered nails light up the secret black gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rugged sound in his mouth that was hard to hear by others, and the faces of the soul around him appeared and twisted. Kneeling. But they are all silent, and they have invested in the dead black ash at the tip of the index finger, which makes it dyed with a pale color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the "Death Lord" gradually became transparent and became not much different from the soul face. Then I was sucked in by my index finger. Only one finger with pale and black ash is left in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of screaming screamed. A vague face fluttered from the tip of the index finger with a wide open mouth, and instantly passed over the time and space, and rushed to the back of Franz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassination?" Franz stared blankly at the front of the line. I don't quite understand why I am assassinated in the glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ray of light on his body, and the triggering superb items tried to block the penetration of the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, the finger that has become a strange black and white gray suddenly popped out in front of Franz, passing through the defensive defensive, gently Point on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial attack was the most powerful and strange unique legendary spell of "Death Lord". He named himself "Death Resonance" and other magicians gave it The magic is a nickname - "call of death", and the second wave of "finger" is a legendary item left by the "death lord", a one-time legendary item, "the right hand dominated by the underworld"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Franz’s horrified expression solidified and his body quickly became dark gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sneaked into the air and saw the cathedral in the city like It was violently shaken by an earthquake. In an instant, the earth cracked, and a gap that rolled the red magma was like a monster's huge mouth, engulfing the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the cracks in the earth were closed, and the surroundings were safe and sound, and there was no trace, except that the church and the clergy inside disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This level of ground power manipulation..." Fernando felt that this was the most powerful and exaggerated strength of the land that he had seen. Of course, He also saw similar spells of the Nine Rings, "and the attack is against the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He judges from this point that the other is a friend Enemy, so slowly landed, waiting for the dawn, mixed into the city, inquire about the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pope must be white, wrinkles seem to fall from the face, old is not like a living human, He wears a holy crown, holding Platinum scepter, eyes look at the cardinal and sacred knights below, not sullenly: "In addition to the members who are not allowed to return to the fortress, the cardinal group has arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice was majestic but loving, and after a pause, he lifted the Platinum Scepter, an unusually sacred and solemn: "The Lord descended to me, appointed the new Pope, and I will return tonight. Heaven Mountain, returning to the embrace of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the gift of the Lord, and your dedication to the church is like an endless ocean." All Cardinal members Bowed his head and said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pope gently beheaded: "Our dedication is what we have gained, I am now proclaiming the Lord's deity, the new pope is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze swept across the faces of several cardinals, satisfied with their calmness and piety, and then the voice was elevated, grand and sacred:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Griffith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May your way go to the ground, as if you were walking in your country." The middle-aged man with plain white robe walked out and prayed devoutly to the ground. His skin was dark and the facial features were ordinary. Compared with the farmer in the field, there were not so many wrinkles, but every move was full of people's demeanor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is forever!" The other cardinals also stumbled and painted a cross on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, everyone stood up and watched Griffith step by step toward the seven-story steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first step of Griffith, the ethereal songs, the sacred light, the numerous gravel-like angels, etc. Fes is like walking in the kingdom of the god of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the glory enveloped Lance, and all clerics and believers prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projection of Heaven Mountain appears in the air, and a holy light falls on Griffith, as if to give him a halo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grifis took the last step, solemnly and respectfully took the Platinum Scepter from the old Pope, then turned to face the Cardinal And lift the scepter high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a sacred and majestic voice descends from infinity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name 'Gregory'!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old pope smiles, his body is utterly thorough, like the purest Holy Spirit, then he disintegrates and turns into countless holiness The light spot flies into the heavenly mountain projection in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grifis painted a cross on his chest, as all the popes took over, the entire Lans City announcement was made:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From today, I am both Gregory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal members once again stumbled: "On the truth forever!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forefront of this group of cardinal members is a man in a white-and-white robe. His shape is cut by stone, handsome and straight, but his nose is slightly hooked. It seems a bit gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
