			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not a formal canonized knight, there is no ritual of etiquette, Lucian thanked Natasha with the Knights, and Natasha put the sword in On the shoulders of Lucien, serious and serious: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May your sword protect your will."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all this, Lucien solemnly took over the "vigilance" given by Natasha, which is a "ceremonial" sword with a gorgeous decoration but a common blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to" Natasha’s guidance, Lucien successfully used his will to leave his breath on the "vigilance", knowing that this sword is not It looks so fancy and fragile, it has the same attack power as a normal first-class knight, and with the degree of intuition to the level of the second-level knight, is a very good "extraordinary" sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical swords and enchanted swords that the magicians used to call are extraordinary weapons in the aristocrats and pastors. These weapons are not like magical items. The magical items need to be imprinted in the center. After they are taken, they can be used simply by leaving their breath, but some weapons will exclude certain types of users according to the limitations of the forge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear the long sword, Lucien got up and said goodbye, watching Natasha suddenly chuckle, said to Camille: "Although He wants to keep it secret, but I think that Silvia has also received an invitation from Felice. Hey, I haven't met Felice for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ......... Because the evening is his own oyster party, Felice did not go to Victor's home to study in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the 18-year-old (Cheng-Ren) ceremony of Felice, so many guests have been invited, including the close relationship between the Haien family and the title. Aristocrats, as well as all the musicians and famous musicians of the association." Lott chatted with Lucien during the break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked in a relaxed mood: "It’s a grand banquet, don’t know how many guests can be invited, how much?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quieter Herodotus faintly looked at Lucien: "The musicians of the association, as long as they are in Aalto, will go to participate, because someone I will play a new serenade as a gift for oysters. Everyone is curious and want to see what kind of works the music genius can write after more than a month of silence."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the concert at the St. John's Hall, Victor strictly protected Lucine, and did not allow him to accept invitations for various banquets, salons, parties, even to be a guest of a concert. I am worried that he is addicted to this because he is too famous. In this way, the low-key mysterious music genius Lucien is even more curious, not to mention the many unscrupulous people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nobleman with the title also depends on the attitude of the Earl of Hain. According to the rules of the Haien family, each member of the family must be personally presided over. Banquet, I don’t know if this time, the Earl of Hein will not find a reason.” Lott said not quite surely, and then shifted the topic: “In fact, we are very curious about Lucien’s serenade.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own exclusive lounge and the piano room in the villa, Lucien’s “creation” became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "It’s only a few hours away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............ In the evening, sitting on the carriage that I hired, Lucien went to the door of Feilis in the aristocratic area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage has already filled the empty space opposite, and the three-storey villas that are gorgeous and full of Tria Palace style are brightly lit and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This villa itself is the old Earl to host a banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the gate, through the garden, up the steps, stepping on the neat stone floor, Lucien came to the door of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis put on a family-style red court dress, skirts propped up, elegant and dignified, greeted guests with her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien coming over, Felice smiled sweetly and sincerely: "Thank you for coming, Lucien. Because of you, many musicians come to participate." Banquet, including President Christopher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice's mother looks like her, has the same rich lips and bright appearance, but the hair is the most common brown, she enthusiastically said: "Welcome to our music genius, the entire Aalto nobility circle is eager Discussing you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are so many guests coming in, after a few words with Felice's mother and daughter, Lucien went in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of the hall, the table, the food, the flowers, etc. are placed in the same way as the last dance, belonging to the unique style of the Felice family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already a lot of guests inside, they are holding high-altitude wine glasses, and there is no chance to communicate with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Evans." While walking, many people greet Lucien, who belong to the Musicians Association, known or ordinary. The musicians, who have only written one or two pieces of music, have not yet been recognized as newcomers, and those who are already excellent musicians but are preparing to move towards musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their expressions are different, curious, expecting, smirking, perfunctory, and meaningful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the music genius that is best known as the most revolutionary surname, what kind of serenade will it come up with? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serenade style for salons and banquets is harder to write than the serenade that expresses love or expresses a quiet and beautiful mood. Its style and theme are limited. It can only be played on such vulgar occasions, and it is impossible to board an elegant stage such as a concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably just a piece of fun, congratulations. Don't expect too much." Many older musicians are surrounded by old but not bearded Chris Beside Dorf, he discussed the views on Lucian's works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And others who did not speak quietly thought: "But you can accuse him of falling and indulge in the reputation of genius."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher nodded to Lucy, who was looking at it, and smiled at the surrounding musicians: "To give young people more space, don't It’s too harsh for them. At this age, it’s normal to lose the harvest. Failure can give them more wealth. Of course, this age is also the time when the creation is the most unconstrained, the most inspiration is the most free, and there may be unexpected surprises. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wayne came over, more than a dozen musicians stopped the topic, talking about music creation, Lucien was from the end The waiter who passed the tray took a glass of white water and listened quietly to their discussion with modesty and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the older ones more satisfied, at least Lu Xien is not the kind of young man who has talent and has a reputation for being arrogant and ignorant. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Victor, Lot, and Rhein also arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The time passed by, the atmosphere of joy in the banquet gradually solidified, and the musicians stopped discussing. It was already half past seven, the sea. Count Earl has not come yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis’ father, Urban, a middle-aged red-haired man with a beautiful moustache also stood nervously at the door, his face was ugly "Isn't Scott still forgetting the previous things? But this is the banquet of the younger generation, how can it be so petty and narrow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Occasionally, if the Earl of Hein does not appear, it will have a great influence on the reputation of Felice in the aristocratic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another ten minutes, when Felice’s hands were twisted together, finally the housekeeper of the Earl of Hein arrived, polite but expressionless Said: "The Earl is sick, can not come to the banquet, please host yourself in the class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulban face is blue and mad Can't tell, Felice and her mother are pale, seemingly breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of nobles with close relationship with the Haien family are waiting for the attitude of the Earl of Hein, so many servants are running in the darkness near the villa. Return to the respective villas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Erban is the clerk of the City Hall, who has mastered a lot of real power. For another reason, some small nobles are still unaffected. Come one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
