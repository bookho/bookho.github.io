			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman's green eyes exude a fascinating light, and Lucien's head immediately became dizzy, stupid and wondering what she was doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the conscious and conscious, Lucien found himself lying on a silver-gray platform, like a patient waiting for surgery or about to be dissected The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, Lucien’s wrist, ankle, neck and other places were fixed by a silver-gray metal ring emerging from the platform, an ice-cold fine needle It is inserted into the blood vessels, causing unspeakable stinging and mild paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This ancient heritage magician is at least a high-level..." Lucien did not panic, secretly judging the strength of the old woman, although her mental strength was imprisoned. Live, but the soul is still the soul of the four-ring magician. If there is a huge gap in strength, it will be difficult to be "instructed" so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black tentacle-like pipelines seem to have survived and swam from mid-air to the sides of Lucien’s head, sticking to the temples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This seems to be a magical item that records the changes of the soul?" Lucien has never found a record of the electric shocks of ancient magicians who have needed electric shocks from the data, almost I thought that I met Professor Yang who was also passing through, so I could only judge the final purpose from the experimental magic array, magic items, etc., and then hurry up and say: "This lady, are you conducting an electric shock to stimulate the soul change experiment? I think I Being an assistant is more useful than being an experimental material."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman laughs like an owl: "Hey, in fact, you as an experimental material. It's much more useful than the assistant. I rarely encounter a mid-level magician here. Your mutated soul can bring me new experimental data to make up the basis of my improved magic ritual."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien still want to talk, she read a weird word, so Lucien opened her mouth and found that she could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, language is just a weapon with nothing to do, don't try to influence my decision. Here, I am the only master, I can only enter the electric shock test. After all, there is no need to consider any other factors!” The old woman looks a little crazy. “I have seen the letter on your body, but what do the two legendary magicians have with me? Can they find it here? Is it threatening me? I am afraid of them? Can I go out? I will complete the experiment as soon as possible and find a way to improve my strength so that I can open it there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien really wants to shout: "Then you should let me go! We can sit down and discuss together to find a way to effectively improve our strength. I have a lot of similar experimental materials here!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, such a shout can only be blocked in the throat and become a beast-like slap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to calm down, Lucien said with a dignified thought: "She is confused in language, unclear, and a little crazy. In this way, communication It's very difficult, unless you find what she wants the most. Hey, I would rather meet a wicked but mentally normal magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the description of her discourse She is also the magician who is imprisoned in the land of demons, the third survivor of the young servant's mouth, and seems to have been trapped here for a long time. It is no wonder that the mental condition will have problems. If you want to impress her, maybe it’s time to I started to do this. However, I don’t know anything about it here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman picked up a magic wand like a black snake and fixed her way to the road. On the metal ring of the wrist and ankle, a small silver-white electric snake emerged and slammed into his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrist and the ankle are burning pain first, followed by strong paralysis, which makes Lucien feel the unspeakable pain, the muscles start to twitch, and gradually lose consciousness. , becoming numb, the brain and the soul seem to be puncture back and forth by numerous fine needles, causing extreme pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien prefers to increase the current to the limit, so that he will fall into a blank and will not feel the unbearable pain, but only Can force himself to hold on, not letting himself faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lose consciousness, you will not be able to know what impact this experiment will have on the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien had no strength to bite his teeth, and there was no way to clench his fists. He could only hold on to death. The only belief was that he could not give up and could not give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is slowly expanding under the stimuli of the current, as if all the potentials have been stimulated, but the pain is more intense and more unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between half-half and half-awake, Lucien heard the voice of the old woman:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "1 minute 23 seconds, the soul began to change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."4 minutes and 10 seconds, he can still support, there seems to be a firm belief His soul and brain are not losing consciousness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the power of faith reverse the influence of the soul? Instead of being transformed into The will of the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The will is also produced by the human body, perhaps with a mysterious connection with the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Therefore, all extraordinary powers are essentially the same. Lord Sunos and many legendary magicians have been trying to touch the most essential truth through the ascension of power. The world is complex, too Simple, perhaps there is really the only essence that constitutes everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Old woman deviates from her own Inspection purposes, began to observe the situation from the unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, when Lucien thought that he would fall into the “electric shock hell” forever, the feeling of paralysis subsided, in exchange for the pain of the whole body and Soft and weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good! You are more suitable as an experimental material than I thought." The old woman is not satisfied with her own satisfaction, although this satisfaction is not what Lucien wants. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she looked at Lucien carefully and smiled and said: "When your soul is stable and recovering, let’s carry out subsequent experiments. As long as you can survive , there will be a very, very big harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien found himself regaining his ability to speak at this time, so he tried: "This lady, in the human body And the soul experiment, I have a wealth of information and a lot of newly developed magic, maybe it can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, look, see, one The little boy tried to guide me? I looked stupid, very knowledgeless?” The old woman used the magic wand as a walking stick to squat on the ground. The squatting body seemed to bend back and forth, and the voice was pleasant and vicious. “You are too touched. Level of magic? Have you analyzed their principles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't, but behind me is the Magic Council, there are many legendary magicians, Masters, High-level wizards have conducted countless human and soul experiments, and can be found in the library. Information. "Lucien slow recovery from twitching and weakness in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman’s dry mouth cracked open, revealing a flat dark red gums, and her eyes flashed with madness: “What use? How high can you touch? Level? Can it help me to open it? Can I restore my vitality and restore my youth? Can I get rid of the imprisonment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mental state seems to be very Unstable, so waved the young servant to take the road to Xi'an to go to the cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien couldn’t communicate with a madman, only hoped that she would calm down and think of her own words, impressed by the experimental data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting rid of the identity of experimental materials is currently the most urgent step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When leaving the Magic Lab, Lucien was still in the sequelae of electric shock, so he walked very slowly, but the young servant did not have any support for him. The idea is to walk in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul seems to be enhanced. Is the electric shock stimulation really effective?" Lucien checked his condition and was surprised to find that his soul was taken continuously. A month's pharmacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone, and carefully sensed it, Lucien thought thoughtfully: "It doesn't seem to be directly enhanced, but the soul is not yet developed. The potential is motivated, and such current stimuli are only harmful to the magic apprentices and ordinary magicians who are not powerful enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
