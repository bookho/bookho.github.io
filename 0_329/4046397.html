			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a piece of past events, Borak has the feeling of confiding pain, and has vented all the grievances of recent years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, Borac’s memories gradually came to an end, and the soul after venting became slightly clear, seeming to regain the power of advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still and far away, and Borak only feels that his soul is fluttering and fluttering, and the deep darkness is integrated into one, and the eyelids are getting more and more heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract is successful, and you are the real knight after you wake up!" The voice of the "greedy" devil is erratic in Borak, bringing him even more Heavy sleepiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract is successful? I want to be a knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak finally puts down his mind Concerned, completely immersed in a deep sleep, wrapped in a thick dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind of November blew, the secret guard outside the study is involuntarily I shuddered, and then completely awake, and heard the vague voice inside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract is successful, you pay for ten years of life, in exchange for The strength of the official knight, and retain the possibility of advanced knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This five-level grandfather Frederick's slightly jaw, it seems that Borak I didn’t sell my soul and the core interests of the family: “But how confused it was just now, is it that the magical ritual has produced a strange power that will confuse my will?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no clock in the corridor, and he also "forgot" to look at the pocket watch, so he thought that the previous confusion was only a short time of ten seconds, and did not feel any problem. In many cases, a similar reaction will occur in a voyeur magic ritual, which is the self-protection of mysterious extraordinary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness shrouded in, listening quietly to the powerful heartbeat of "Bolaq" inside, Frederick slightly stunned: "This is the knight level." Heartbeat? Borak has become a formal knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Becoming a knight", Borak seems to be unable to control his physical condition, he was heartbeat, Breathing and other aspects have judged the "real" situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So simple, inexplicable magic rituals really work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freid Derek couldn't believe this fact, but the current state of "Bolaq" eloquently proves the power of the strange ritual. A little bit of greed in his heart sneaks up, and it has been stuck for 30 years before the day of the Knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can't find a breakthrough, I will try this magical ritual." Greed makes his heart beat faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Lucien was looking at the dim candlelight and watching In the mirror, the handsome and dark black hair has become a beautiful blonde blue eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gorse family is notoriously a beautiful family." Lucy, the blue-eyed blonde, smiled and shook her head, reaching out to smooth out half-length hair, buckle The good neckline and sleeves, the original bleak and bleak "Bolaq" immediately radiant, seems to return to the spirit of vigor and confidence five years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many widely circulated stories and poems, the description of the gorse family is exaggerated, absurd, full of fictional elements, but one thing is not said. Wrong, the gorse family is indeed the blood descendant of the "Sun King" Tanos. They are located under the ancient villa of Antilles and contain the palace of Tanos. There is a gold knight guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground palace that Lucian wants to mix in is this one, so it’s hard to do it, you have to find another way,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gorse family has a tradition of throwing more than a dozen heir candidates into this secret underground palace when it is right, letting them fight, cooperate and explore each other, the first to complete The winner of the request will be the first successor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent decades, this way of selecting heirs has been accidentally leaked. The nobles belonging to the gorse also threw their children into the underground palace. On the one hand, they exercised them. On the other hand, they laid the relationship with the heirs in advance. Many boring children of other great aristocrats will also participate, and the almost real bloody fight will make their numb life full of excitement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes the "communication" wrist play a bigger role than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After observation, Lucien chose Borak, he has strong desires and spiritual loopholes, it is best to "cheat", and only the gorse family The "blood veins" can open the inner layer and reach the secret room of the "Tanos Sky Tracker" in the palace. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the method of opening the secret room is complicated and the mantra is difficult, Lucien wants to let Borak replace himself to start the magic ceremony, but now he has to do it himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking in the mirror to confirm that his every move is no different from that of Borak, Lucien looked sideways at the secret room that he spent two days building in the study. In the heart, he smiled at the sleepy Borak: "When I have time, I will come and transform the blood for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an advanced knight who can rely on external forces After that, he still has the potential to become a great knight. There is only one way to use the blood of the high-order vampire to transform the blood in a way similar to the "before", that is, the physical condition of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the inspiration for the wizard to transform the blood was from the vampire's "before". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, they found that a blood family only needs to infuse the origin of its own blood, and to develop a descendant with a formal knight level, and have unlimited Growth may be - although it will be much slower than the original owner of the blood source, but it can be very "easy" to gain strength, so the magicians have mad thoughts, and want to transform this way with other blood. Humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then they found that without the power of the will, the transformation alone could never become a great knight, even if it could transform the body to the Knight of Heaven, or even the Golden Knight. It is also the end of the bloody breakdown and physical burst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether or not Borak has the blood of the "vampire", will he be punished by the gorse family, whether it will be purified by the church, it is not something that Lucien cares about. However, when making a contract, I did not say which blood can not be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, Lucien is no different from the deceitful devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Borak is careful, the discovery may be very low, because the blood of the gorse family comes from the sun king Tanos, all related to the stars in the sky. The blood can be stimulated, there are "the sun", "silver moon", "star" and other top-level, there are also the next level of "Tanos" and other constellation blood, of which "vampire" and "silver moon" similar, It is not caught by the handle of "blood sucking", and it is difficult to distinguish it by careful inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing out the candle, Lucien’s eyes faintly shine through the darkness, pushing the door of the study and walking towards the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inspired 'Silver Moon' bloodline..." Frederick in the dark gently squeezed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the deformation, you can't use the other's talent ability, but it doesn't mean you can't use your own, especially Lu Xi's "moonlight" blood and the blood of the gorse family. Very good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, Lucien’s plan was like this, and he was not worried that Borak would directly choose to become the Duke of the Gorse or the Grand Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of results often depends only on the setting of the option conditions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Frederick’s eyes, spend a few days "adapting" After the bloody ability, Borak revived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeous carriage rides over the wide streets of Antwerp, and the left side of the carriage is engraved with the heraldic pattern of "sun-lit gorse" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The knowledgeable" ** citizens scattered on both sides of the central main road, together with their companions, whispered guessing who the owner of the carriage is, Alten, who is now in the limelight, is still the frustrated Borak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
