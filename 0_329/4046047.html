The reason for being tracked, Lucien can't want to let his unique mental power skills be discovered and cracked so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still carefully walking to the back door, Lucien once again showed the "silence portal" and "switching", quietly left the copper crown pub, then Going around a big circle before returning to your hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in bed, Lucian had a slightly reassuring mood, in the powerful Aalto church, met a magic apprentice companion, just like a gusty wind In the rainstorm, some people work together and don't have to go alone: ​​"It's all magic apprentices, don't know how much Aalto's seclusion magician is left?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, Lucien lived a life of incomparable law, got up in the morning, exercised an hour of body and practiced swordsmanship. Then go to the library to work, sometimes to see religious books and travel notes, sometimes to see music theory, memory fingering and knowledge, and sometimes in the soul library to analyze the structure of magic, magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pieru is very cumbersome, but when he fell into the music world, he was a very quiet teenager, and would not bother Lucian’s study, and Wolf During this time, I was invited to play in a certain count's territory. I didn't come to the library. Other musicians, musicians, and Victor couldn't talk about being friends, but they were not enemies. I didn't have time to make trouble for Sean, so Lucien It’s very leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only small regret is that I couldn’t see Ms. Silvia, a 24-year-old unmarried music. Home, Pieru is very appreciative of her appearance, describing her as if she is a gentle and graceful goddess. Lucian had no guilty heart, but was only infected by the enthusiasm of Pieru, and it was very curious. Unfortunately, Silvia is good at harpsichord, and it is in the piano room of many noble girls and ladies. Come to the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, due to the good learning effect, Lucien’s learning time in text has been compressed to an hour, followed by Lott and Feili As the silk knows the spectrum and sees the knowledge of music, when it is four o'clock, it begins to practice for two hours of piano performance. Over and over again, the tenacity and stubbornness hidden in Lucien’s heart are vividly played on this matter. If you don't practice your satisfaction, you will never stop. When the practice is over, Lucien will lament. Playing the piano is really a physical activity. It makes you sweaty, and your arms and fingers are very sore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, it’s time for Lucien to learn magic and study magic, not to be distracted by anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the evening of the 5th, when I went to Alisa’s home dinner, Lucien noticed the inconspicuous corner of the next corner, and was painted like a child. There are several simple graphics on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When at 10 pm on Saturday, I am waiting for me in front of the sixth abandoned house in the easternmost part of the Adejan district. Owl."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Owl" is the code name of Smyr. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any glance at the content, Lu Xien, the expression is unchanged, the pace is still steadily into the home of Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night at 9:30, the soft silver moon The stars of the hustle and bustle are covered by dark clouds, and the night is deep and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wore a black robes with a hood, checked the location and quantity of the magic material, and put the "Avenue of the Snow" ring on the index finger of the left hand. Then I felt carefully around the room before I carefully went out and melted into the darkness of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the damp, dull warm wind, Lucien walked to the easternmost part of the Adejan area in twenty minutes and found the abandoned one. House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, it is our pleasure to come to our party." Smyr put on his hood and covered his face. His tone was full of joy. "I have told your other companions about you, they I am very happy to ask you some magical problems. Of course, we will pay for this kind of guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic puzzle? Oh, it seems they still I don't really believe that I am a formal 'magician'." Lucien was funny in her heart. Although Lucy only translated a formal magic, Lucien didn't know how much difference he had with the official magician, but he was sure. In this respect, I have outperformed most of the magic apprentices. From the analysis of the "Ice and Snow Vengeance" ring, I can see that "OK, but I am good at astrology and elemental magic. If it is these two problems, I I think I should be able to answer for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is so confident, Smyr affirmed his identity as a formal magician:" Mr. Professor, please follow me. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robes are very difficult to distinguish in the night, but the abandoned house is just a dozen steps away, Lucien easily followed Smyr. Going to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚,咚咚咚,咚,咚...Small knocked the wooden door with a strange rhythm, then learned the owl called two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for five seconds, the wooden door slowly opened, and the person in the same black robes stood in the broken house: "Owl, this is Professor?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice hoarse, and it was deliberately changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Smyr answered briefly with the same low voice. "Mr. Professor, this is the 'fire wolf.'"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently nodded with a hooded head: "Hello." The left hand is hidden in the sleeves, and the ice and snow avengers are ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the small living room of the house, passing through a door, went to the storage room, where there is a staircase facing downwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Basement!" Lucien responded violently. Why should he be obsessed with building a magic laboratory in the sewer? Obviously you can make a small basement yourself, and not only the sewer below the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, you can completely carry out magic experiments and spellcasting exercises in the basement with little movement and little fluctuations in magic, and the kind of movement is very big, you can Find a remote place in the Melzer Black Forest, build a complete underground lab, and do an experiment every week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basement is not large, with ten low stools, a long table in the middle, with two candles on it, a yellowish flame In the middle, the magic apprentices of eight black robes and black hoods are horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucine walked cautiously and with high alertness, the fire wolf and Smyr closed the entrance to the basement and followed it down and sat down. On the low stool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small stood up and saw all the magic apprentices: "You, this is a professor, a formal magician, with profound knowledge and Strong strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he introduced these magic apprentices to Lucien: "This is white honey, morning star, reindeer, white gloves, eucalyptus, sage , Mercury, hanged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "It’s nice to meet you, can you let me see it before I start? This "Arcane"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the sage answered old and replied: "No problem, Mr. Professor, feel free to watch, we communicate first. Right, I Bring the magic experiment utensils you need. If you can guide me to a magic problem, then this magical experimentware is yours. If not, you need thirty Yinnar." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, while handing a book with a dark black hard cover to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien received the hand and did not open it immediately, but looked at the cover carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of silvery white lines in the dark black that make people look like they are sucked in. They form two common words "Arcane" and several The size of the finger: "The 11th sacred calendar 790", with a deep mystery in the simple, and the parchment used in the text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
