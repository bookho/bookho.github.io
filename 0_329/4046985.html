			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando grabbed the notebook and showed himself a "high invisibility", which disappeared into the study and quietly listened to the footsteps of Sasso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, two, three, more and more footsteps sounded at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come so many people? It’s sneaky..." Fernando created a peek into the eyes, letting them fly apart and monitoring the entire villa— - Although this spell has a range of restrictions, but the villa of Tucker is old and narrow, but it is under control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of no one, a crystal ball suddenly lights up, showing the scene in the hall - "high invisibility" can not cover this effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, men and women dressed in ordinary clothes walked like ghosts, and their footsteps were light, seemingly afraid of awakening the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are about a dozen people, who are spreading apart, surrounded by a man with a horrified look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man has a light red thin hair, a raised forehead, a broken eyebrow in the middle, a half of the nose, a valgus mouth and a pair of leftovers The white-eyed eyes and the ugliness of the five senses are not at all natural, as if they were arbitrarily sewed by a self-sufficient child, and as a monster that would appear in a dream without logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes that he smashed looked up at the ceiling, and the ears that were bitten by the dog trembled slightly, waiting for the dozens of men and women to stand in strange positions. Suddenly he said: "The gods save the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is not as "ugly" as the appearance, ethereal and high, seems to descend from infinity, making people feel Fear of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask the true God to save me, etc." The men and women clasped their hands together and slowly fell to the side, eccentric and distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man continued his previous tone. Seriously and solemnly said: "After birth, everyone is suffering. They are repaying crimes. Everyone will suffer from hunger, trauma, jealousy and betrayal. They will not be happy one day. They are overwhelmed by infinite pressure. Moreover, at the end of the day, no one can escape death, and can only go to death with fear and step by step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But true God tells us that death is eternal, death It is quiet, no worries. There is no pain. When we face death, we must thank God for the grace and thank you for letting you not continue to sink in this dirty world..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said in a sentence, the whole hall is filled with a quiet and addictive atmosphere, the dozens of men and women listened very focused, seems to gradually understand the true meaning of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the mission of the god of death that is the god of death?" Fernando, through the surveillance of the demon eye, probably figured out what happened in the hall. And preliminary guessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is infiltrated by the Church of the Holy Spirit, and a similar situation is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​his just flashing, his heart suddenly noticed something wrong: "But how can they go to Tucker’s house to hold a missionary ceremony? Do they know the Tucker family? No one?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep doubts rise. Fernando carefully discerned it. Tucker, who tried to study the mystery of the faith, was not found in this group. Fran used his memory to create a picture of Tucker to show him, so that he could find Tucker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange, are they related to Tucker's ‘missing’?” Fernando looked more closely at the “believers”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... As long as we can get the care of the true God, we will have eternal life in death, no eternal life without pain..." The voice of the priest suddenly became high. At the same time raised his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his right hand raised, the dozens of men and women climbed up from the ground and jumped up the strange dances that Fernando had never seen before. Their gestures They are all distorted, as if they are not afraid of joint damage and feel no pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unlike normal religious ceremonies..." Fernando still studied it a bit. "The believers of the god of death are so special?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest's right hand was lowered, but there was a sharp dagger with silver and cold light. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fernando thought that the priest was to harvest the lives of these believers to please the god of death, the priest’s right hand turned over and directly inserted the dagger into his chest. , blood berthed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amount?" Fernando was completely stunned. He knew a lot about the sacrifice ceremony, but he had never seen the host commit suicide! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood drips on the dirty floor, a squatting man suddenly gets the call of the gods, his eyes turn red, his tongue sticks out, Take this drop of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his throat screamed, and the wolf slammed into the priests who fell to the ground, and the two rows of white teeth were exposed. Biting on the neck of the priest, brushing and tearing off a large piece of flesh and blood, swallowed it incessantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other men and women are also crazy, and they also rushed to the priest, biting his flesh and blood, chewing and admiring in an admirable manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the believers who were full of blood and crusty meat, Fernando couldn’t help but feel a nausea. Although he also studied Necromancer, he I have never seen such a disgusting scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crazy food competition, a lot of blood was wasted, gathered under the body to form a pool of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood in the "Water Margin" suddenly evaporated, creating a haze of blood around everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bloody fog, a face slammed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark red is like a veil, stretched over the face, only the protruding parts such as the eyes, nose and mouth are presented. Let it be endlessly weird and terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted in a hoarse voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being excited by this voice, Fernando was shocked, and I didn’t know when the sleepiness left him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he discovered that the scene in the crystal ball is still the "normal picture" of the priests who are observing prayers and men and women in "dance". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to me?" Fernando subconsciously asked, and soon realized that he was affected by illusion, and unconsciously entered the dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around with caution, and he said in his heart: "I can definitely enter the dream through the previous scenes. It is definitely not only high-level, but also a Master. And he is still good at the great mage in the field of dreams. What do he want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he was shocked and thought: "The one who called 'Save me' is to make The Archmage of the Dream? He created the dream to call for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not rush out to investigate the dozens of strangers, because the "rescue" used This kind of way of calling for help is obviously to escape the monitoring of certain existence. If you rush to act, it is likely to encounter unexpected events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the person calling for help being imprisoned? No, if it is imprisoned, the power of his leak cannot affect me unless he is strong. Above the legend, the one who can imprison him is not something I can provoke. If he is not imprisoned, but he is injured somewhere in the city, it can force a Master to be so difficult, at least also nine. Strong, he may be nearby..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This technique is obviously a magician, so why don't he ask for help directly from the 'Mage'? There should be access to Aalto unless, unless the 'Mage's bureaucrat' is monitored by the secret powerhouse, perhaps the 'Mage's bureaucrat' has a problem, betrayed or replaced..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, will the secret powerhouse leave the city of Cooper to help the magician ask for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando shook his head resolutely, certainly not, maybe he would be caught if he tried to get out of town. I asked quietly kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
