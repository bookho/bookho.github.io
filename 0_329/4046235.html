			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, what experiment? About synthetic life substances?" Lavin is like all old-school gentlemen, gray hair is neatly combed, but His eyes were sharp and the gods, and Lucien, who was staring at him, was under tremendous pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris and Gaston looked at Lucien with a smile and a smile, guessing what he was still thinking, what an unusual thing Experiments, after all, whether it is in the area where the church is strong or Alin, he has made a lot of noise, it is hard to believe that he is simply trying to discuss the arcane experiment with several high-level arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien in the eyes of several big names with different meanings, try to keep calm, the tone is not urgent or slow: "In fact, this experiment says that the completion is still not talking On, I just had a preliminary idea, and I did the first experiment with a few magical arrays. The results are in line with my expectations. But in this way, because the experimental environment formed by the magic array has too many loopholes, far away. I can't say the correct conclusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After submitting the urea paper to Felipe to throw out the evidence to determine the surname, Lucien borrowed the magic lab just right. Completed the experiment again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi interrupted Lucien’s prefix statement: “Evans, focus.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Morris and Gaston are relatively smiling about Lavin's direct violent surname, his paper is always focused, and he can't talk to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what made them stunned was that Lucien was able to talk nonsense under the pressure of Raven’s momentum: "Okay, Mr. Raven, I After talking about the Arcane knowledge, I was very interested in the magic experiment, so I designed a lot of experiments. Unfortunately, due to the strength, I can't arrange a high-level magic array, many experiments are difficult to complete and verify. It wasn't until the expedition that I entered the lab left by an ancient magician. With some well-preserved magical arrays and alchemy arrays, I completed some of them, including experiments on synthetic urea."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking, Evans." Lavin has signs of roaring, and he is not too concerned about the remains of ancient magicians, except for the half of the legendary level magicians. Face, lock, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien coughed: "After completing this experiment, I personally began to think that the human body can be made from non-living matter, and their living surnames reflect some vitality. And most of the other vitality is above the soul, I know very little about it, so there is not much research in this area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan S, tell me directly what your experiment is?!” Ravendi snarled, Morris and Gaston subconsciously stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not expect that the roar of facing Ravendi would be so terrible, he was amazing! However, the effect of self-improvement should be achieved. That is to say that the badly complete narrative and concealed past experience is expressed in such a vague and fragmentary way, so that the three gentlemen can make an impression in the subconscious, and then Will not pay attention to this aspect of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An experiment to further overthrow the theory of human life mechanics. For the Necromancers, at this point, they will admit whether they are willing or unwilling to accept it. The mistakes of human life mechanics, but our main enemy is the church, we can't let them slow down, we must give them a huge impact before they find the theoretical support again, try to make their beliefs chaotic and hit them hard. The arrogance of the arrogance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician, when it was discovered that there was an opportunity to weaken the church, Lucien was certainly not willing to let go, and used some The idioms on the earth are just awkward when these sentences are spoken in common words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the Magic Council and the Church will be a long and tortuous process. Since Lu Xien has chosen the path of magic, it is improving its strength and exploring Beyond the main purpose of the mysteries of the world, you will certainly not hesitate to stand on the side of the Magic Council to weaken the church and attack the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point of enlightenment, Lu Xien still has, in the case of such a powerful enemy, single-handedly can only be a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon’s dark yellow eyes look at Lucien: “What is the experiment? This time it was after you and Felipe were attacked. Good consultation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am an enemy, a competitor, not a friend. Felipe wants to fight the stubborn extremists in the pale hand. In addition to revenge, I want to weaken the church. But this experiment can really be in a strict experimental environment. Success will definitely lead to crazy revenge of the church. I can submit experimental ideas to the will of the element, but I hope that the three gentlemen can keep secrets for me, and it is best for you to complete and demonstrate the final experimental results."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face solemnly raised his own request, and finally Felipe attracted most of his hatred to him, and he did not need to jump out to share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is slightly frowning, his voice is loud and clear: "I will not possess the experimental results of others. If Evans's experiment is verified, it can further overthrow the human body." Life mechanics said, then I will ask Lord Hathaway to use the Arcane Master's privilege to directly seal all the information about the author of this paper. The public announcement is the high-level collective completion of the elemental will. Until you have enough strength and mentality to prepare for the stormy waves. Then, come back to receive this glory. At that time you should also be the top of the elemental will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only for the sake of Xiao Natasha, I won't object," Morris smiled, and temporarily saved a new Holm crown ring material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien’s experiment can further overthrow the theory of human life mechanics, he and Felipe are likely to share the Holm Crown Award and the Immortal Throne Award— - These awards, while recognizing the contribution of the magician, are more accurately the corresponding research results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that Lucien has given up these glory for a while, and Morris’s heartache has eased a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very sensible choice, after the completion of this research project, I hope that Evans can have a calm time to improve his magical power and will study your research. The results are mapped to magic. In the world of magic, no strength is difficult to move forward, at least for many exploration experiments, you can't finish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdong gently The jaws, then to Lavendi and Morris, "This matter, except for the three of us, only you can know that you are a student, a lady, a devil, or a summoner." If things leak, it means that there are church spies among us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris informed the secret place in the town of Sariva with a message After studying Hathaway of Natural Deity, he nodded to Lucian: "Well, Evans can say the design of the experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien At the end of the East, I began to talk about the experimental design: "There are many legends in the ancient magic empire, depicting The first scenes of the world, the floods, the lightning, the high temperatures, and the church "Sacred" have similar epics, but the god of truth that created all of this calms the harsh environment and then creates humans. So I The experiment was to simulate such an environment, and at the same time introduce different gases to see what would happen at the end. When a group of gases was introduced, I saw the source of life..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Magic Council, the Necromancer is deeply involved in the study of the human body. Among the living substances they define, proteins are called the cornerstone of life, and the amino acids that make up proteins are called the source of life. At the same time, since there is no research on the initial environment of the world, Lucien also avoided the defects of the Miller experiment in environmental design, and directly replaced it with different gas control groups. Anyway, I did not use this experiment to explore the origin of life, just to Further overthrowing the theory of human life mechanics, as to how they will be taught, is their problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silence, silence for a long time, then Lavin almost whispered: "Which group of gases?!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before thoroughly understanding all the essences, no matter how far the society develops, whether there is magic, or whether there are gods, those questions are always plaguing the intelligent creatures: "Who am I?" I?" "Where did we come from?" "If there is a god to create everything, then where does He come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Felipe threw out an experiment to determine the surname. For several consecutive days, the briefing was to fine-tune some of the Necromancer magic, and to reverse the effect of the human body's life mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part of the enlightened Necromancer began to rebuild his own cognitive world, while the ultra-conservatives were silent and did not make any sounds about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe also received the manuscript of the "Arcane" journal for the second time in his life, and was praised by Pesall and other pale hands. And the award, while being recognized by most Necromancers as the most promising candidate for the next legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
