			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the ring and listened to Natasha’s words and said: “The Grand Duke is really a genius magician. At the age of twenty-three, I got the highest honor in the field of elemental magic. Shouldn't she be a high-ranking magician at that time?" This is a kind of tribute, but such a genius would abandon his magic for love. the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles calmly and seems to be in the memory of her mother: "Mother often said that everyone has their own strengths, only to see if they can find out After the Holm kingdom supported the magic parliament, there were many other choices for the descendants of the interior of the king who could not stimulate the blood. Many children who were laughed at in the training and fighting exercises of the knights later became outstanding magicians. My mother Originally, the body was weak and the mental strength was not outstanding. Even if the medicine could not stimulate the blood power, it could leave its own footprint on the magic road. When she won the 'Holm Crown' award, she was only a first-level magic. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately her body and soul have been eroded by all kinds of strange magical elements all the year round, plus the blow of the brother's lord's call, in the attempt to advanced high magic After the teacher failed, he could never get out of the hospital bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dagong Lady has been studying magic?" Lucien was slightly surprised, but wanted to come to the church for this. Special Defined objects should be an eye, close one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha wrinkled her nose and smiled: "If the father does not let her study magic, she may take me and my brother back to Holm." When she was young, she was most impressed by her, except that her father couldn’t get along with other people. It was the magical laboratory of the ice and all kinds of strange medicinal tastes. As for the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ring should have a special meaning for Natasha..." Lucien looked at the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also looked down at the ring in Lucien’s hand, laughing very freely: “The ring is not important, what matters is my feelings for my mother. Don't you have a ring, I won't miss her, think of her? Lucien, don't twist and pinch like a girl, as a token related to magic, it is the most appropriate. But it may also represent a certain Trouble, if you don't encounter too many problems, it is best not to take it to find the 'Elemental Will' organization or the Holm Royal Devil's Court. After you become a high magician, it will probably give you one more A good instructor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was said by Natasha, shaking his head and laughing and closing the ring: "Thank you, Princess Her Royal. Vampire Has the effect of blood not disappeared? I am carrying you back to Aalto?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It disappeared, but temporarily suppressed the sequelae, but returned to Aalto without Question, Lucien, you should leave soon, I am worried that the church may come over at any time." Nata Swinging the slender palm, "Do not worry about your identity, give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I continue to use Lucien Evans in the future?" Lucien intended to change his name to the Holm Kingdom, so as not to be implicated in John. It is inevitable that after hearing Natasha’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha sneered at Lucien: "Do you think that Lucien Evans is a special name? Aalto has A lot of people. As long as you get to Holm and don't take the initiative to mention that you are a famous musician, who would think of you? As for the musician Lucien Evans, this identity is actually a good cover, maybe you will return to Stormwind later. It can also come in handy. As for how to make 'he' exist for a long time, as long as you occasionally send me some new pieces of music, I will handle it well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will probably concentrate on magic learning and research in the future, and music should be very rare." Lucien knows that a famous identity on the face is not very useful after being used, but he still feels a little hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to keep a piece of work for a few years, I believe in your musical talent. Of course, if you don’t want it, then forget it." Natasha mouth When you say it, your eyes are very bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien vaguely replied: "I try to be." I myself intend to use the music to reconcile the exhaustion of magic learning in my spare time, probably slowly turning to original . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After agreeing how to send a letter to Natasha, Lucien will "weave the bracelet of the weaver" and Aaron’s second-class super-weapons "Dagger", cold iron daggers, etc., with the "vigilant" sword and the Natasha bid farewell: "I hope to see you again, Princess Royal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Natasha didn't have much parting mood, just smiled and said, "Call me Natasha. You will help your friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you, Natasha." Lucien thanked him sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned around and just took two steps. Lucien heard the voice from Natasha from behind: "Lu Xien..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Lucien looked back at her strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles softly: "Remember, life should not only have magic, music, friends and laughter."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will remember." Lucien smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Looking at Lucian’s back into a faint light disappeared in the Black Forest, Natasha smiled and sighed seriously: “Come out. "You have been listening for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Instincts are really keen." In the dark midair, a transparent figure emerges without warning. Slow and clear, it is the "master" of the white bishop's robe, El Salvador, his black gloves and wrists are tied with white handcuffs, "Ms. Camille chased the wrong direction and chased them to the Knights of Huain. Fortunately. I rushed over in time, or how can I know from your conversation that 'Professor' was just an ordinary magician. Hey, an ordinary magician dared to play with and laugh at our night watchman! He not only lost me. All the players, and also the 355th processing object of the purification sequence, is too shameful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His angry emotions are beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked at him indifferently: "You didn't do it. It seems that anger has not destroyed your reason, maybe you have other things to say?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Salvador, who floated in midair, looked down at Lucien’s departure: “I can see that your Royal Highness is very important to Mr. Professor’s, so I Want a deal to help you conceal the fact that the talented musician Lucien is the evil wizard 'Professor'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His anger disappeared without a trace The whole body is shrouded in the hot light. Although Natasha does not wear a blood dragon armor, there is no way to fight in the air. The flight itself has an advantage, but the precaution is always good. If Natasha suddenly throws the thunder sword. Come out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your team is really unfortunate." Natasha commented briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Salvador smiled softly: "My belief in revenge for them is very firm, but revenge can be postponed, and the princess under the attention of the Pope." The opportunity for your cooperation is hard to find if you miss it. This is the best way to achieve the ideal world that I am searching for. The reason why I gave up the bright and bishop's status as a vigil in the dark is because..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to hear what painful things you have." Natasha stopped the long story of El Salvador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El Salvador smiled without mind: "His Royal Highness is direct and decisive, the deal I want is...you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the words are not finished, he will suddenly see Natasha flying to his face, and the "Thundering Long Sword" will pass from bottom to top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A horrific crack appeared on the burning sacred light, splitting it directly in parallel with El Salvador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stands in the air, and the beautiful eyes of silver and purple stare coldly at the incredible El Salvador: "I never accept threats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In El Salvador, I saw that my soul was broken and the remaining consciousness became a ethereal voice: "Heaven Knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha quietly watched Salvador turn into a little bit of light disappearing, revealing a sincere smile: "After Camille Aunt is safe. But I knew they would come so fast, I and Lucien don't have to It’s so hard to run away for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for more than ten minutes, Camille in the black dress flew from the other side of the Black Forest. Come over, with the unconscious of Wyan and Yakasha, her rigid and solemnity became gentle and gentle: "With this danger, you can smooth out the blood and integrate the will, Natasha, you are not a genius knight."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
