			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas's usual evening gown has become a wide and elegant gray magic robes, which are composed of countless dots and lines, which are mysterious and deep. It is wearing a high-hat of the ancient magical empire of the same color, surrounded by a variety of sparkling spar of different colors, like a small celestial system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of dressing makes people suddenly realize that Douglas is not only the pioneer of the Magic Council, but also one of the survivors of the ancient magical empire. The view was deeply engraved in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, thank you for your proposal, after careful calculations and complicated alchemy process, I have made a man-made planet, the next task is Send it to the scheduled track." Douglas and Lucy greeted Lucien, while the right hand pressed on the storage bag, and a silver-gray sphere slammed in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a product of the first experiment, this "artificial planet" is not huge, only half the size of the body, the body is glittering with the metallic luster of silver, inlaid with A variety of gems, painted with complex and wonderful magic lines, the entire ball seems to be completely wrapped in a layer of magic, full of mysterious and mysterious taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So complicated?" With the idea of ​​Lucien, the first time you can verify that the satellite can fly around the world, you don’t need any other functions. Then consider the application of communication, investigation, positioning, and combat. Otherwise, if the universal gravitation of the world is really problematic, the satellite can't surround it normally. Is it not a waste of time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and said: "Not complicated, not complicated, the universe is full of danger, this magical array is resistant to low temperatures..." He patiently gave Lucien explained the role of each magical array of silver metal balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head in disapproval, while listening to Douglas with a relish, learning the magical array of knowledge, from time to time to ask, the end, deliberate aura A flash of authenticity: "His Speaker, why not add a signal to receive and forward the magic array? So we can use the electromagnetic signal to determine its condition on the earth, observe it, provide a multi-faceted proof of the authenticity of the experiment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was doing alchemy, I kept a similar magical array inside, and the function of the main magical array is beyond your imagination, and it can almost rival the legendary magic." Douglas He was not annoyed because of the problem of Lucian, and he answered his questions very kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the listener, Luciana is very curious: "What is the function?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, keep it secret, wait until this experiment is successful and you will see it." Douglas smiled and looked at his three students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti’s narrow eyes looked at the “artificial planet” with a bit of enthusiasm: “I can’t wait to know, I can’t wait for those stupid guys. Announce the correctness of the teacher's theory and poke the illusory dreams of their 'ether media'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the experiment has not yet begun and the victory is announced. You have seen me. The most idiotic idiot." Fernando sarcastically ridiculed Altty, and did not care that the other teacher was next to him, and changed to Douglas, he would say the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti dare not confront Fernando, only slightly embarrassed to bow his head and accept criticism in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower "Prophet" Begner also looked at Douglas with a little bit of concern: "The reason why the planet has not been discovered is complicated, and perhaps the artificial planet can't be Observed that the Speaker, you have to prepare for failure, this does not completely negate the correctness of your theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears a special gray top of the tower The hat and the eyebrows are all white, except for the deep eyes of the eyes like the starry sky, it seems to be similar to other old people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a reminder of the "Prophet", Alti尓, Luciana and Norman have changed their face slightly, is the prophet lord already foreseen through astrology? At the end of the failure, isn’t it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea was just interrupted and was interrupted by Douglas, who laughed quite arbitrarily: "On the planet I have failed many times. Adding a failure record is not a shame and a desperate thing. It only shows that my theory is still imperfect, and there are factors that have not been accepted. I need more. The failure to discover the cause. The successful throne has always been cast with failure. You should not see that my current strength, reputation and status are so dazzling, forget that I have also experienced countless failures."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If our experiments today are successful, it proves that we humans can also create planets and create the world, but we have just taken the first step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Douglas smiled and turned to Lucien: "And all this thanks to Lucien, his unconstrained thoughts, the ability to reverse thinking, and let me get rid of the shackles of past experience.<br <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, a small step for the Speaker, a big step for mankind? Lucien was unaware of the conscious, silently holding the words of Douglas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando noticed that his students were absent-minded, gave him a glance, and then said to Douglas: "Don’t be embarrassed, the testimony of success is still published after success. Otherwise it becomes a joke. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophet" Bergner also smiled and explained to Altty and others: "My words were not prophecies, but an old friend." Concerns, in order to predict Douglas's affairs, I have to prepare for at least a month to hope that the mistakes are not so bad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti尓, Luciana, Norman’s face was depressed and the tension slowly subsided, and Douglas said nothing, just clicked. Nod, the artificial planet is taken into the space storage bag and the magic tower is activated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the illusory night sky in the half-face, the stars are abruptly After the extinction, the mountains, forests, lakes, grasslands, and magic towers were completely stretched out of the darkness of the fingers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the white lines on the magic tower From the beginning, it formed a magical array of complex anomalies.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic array was just complete, the magic tower suddenly creaked, trembled violently, and countless energy like turbulent The sea gathers in the space in front of Douglas and gathers into a deep gate with numerous constellation symbols.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You return to Allinge and watch the stars. Douglas told me that at the same time, his powerful pressure was released, as if a round of blazing yang, so that Lucien and others could not open their eyes, and it was difficult to extend their spiritual strength.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, he used his own mental strength to push the door to the starry sky, opened a gap, and then stepped in and disappeared into the darkness.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the satellite launch..." Lucien looked at the disappearing starry sky silently, which is very different from the earth! No need for expensive fuel, no huge rockets, no ignition It is done directly with a space jump of the satellite.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Lucien a deep understanding that the magical world also has many aspects over the earth, many fields. There is a simpler means, but I don’t know much about the principle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, a big arcian is a rocket, a satellite, an intercontinental missile, and its strength Glory to yourself!<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To explore other distant planets, space jumps take two to three years to prepare, sometimes even decades, and this near-orbital jump requires only a few days to prepare. Fernando did not waste the opportunity to explain Lucien to the knowledge of space leaps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophet" Bergner looked at the crystal ball in his hand: "Let's go back to Allinge to observe the stars, and don't miss this historic moment. After about three to five minutes, Douglas will be able to reach the scheduled track. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas can get to the scheduled track... How is this sentence a bit wrong, Lucien whispered, once again, the non-human nature of the Arcanist After a deep understanding, he returned to Aringe with the silenced Norman, Luciana, Altty and others, standing on the 33rd floor of the headquarters and looking up at the stars.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, but there is no change in the night sky. Luciana is nervous: "No problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is as if she is asking Fernando, Bergner, Lucien, etc., as if she is talking to herself.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Certainly there will be no problems, just other things are delayed! Alti replied categorically, Norman was as quiet as the two legendary magicians, whispering: "The teacher's theory is not wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
