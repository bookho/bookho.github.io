			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien found himself accustomed to running to a familiar place, he thought of killing the wolf and buried it in the Black Forest opposite the Marsol River. "Dark red bracelet" and "iron black dagger". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal structural models of these two magical items have been thoroughly analyzed by Lucien, who has been studying the book of Astrology and Elements in the past few months. Knowing their respective abilities, one is the third-level high-level magic item "Women's Bracelet", and the other is the apprentice-level enchantment weapon "Cold Iron Dagger". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the confidence of the three-ring magic "Fireball" attached to the "Women's Bracelet" and the second-ring magic "Yangyan Bodyguard". Sean dared to let Natasha lead the big knight, and he stayed behind to deal with the ordinary knights. The result was that although only Aaron was a second-level knight, he was very careful, so that Lucien had to slowly show weakness. The temptation to find a chance to completely kill is more than a minute longer than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Lucien didn’t think that Natasha had just returned in about two minutes, and it seemed that even the process of removing the bracelet of the weaver was seen. In the eyes, and called out the "professor" this self-made word! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lu Xien took out the weaver's bracelet thirty seconds ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha slowly pulled back the situation, stepping back to Todd, and Todd is good at defensive combat, plus the whole body can be steeled There is no obvious key point, so the pace is not chaotic, calm and abnormally adhered to. He believes that as long as he resists Natasha's stormy attack for a few minutes, when her medicinal effect disappears, she can easily win, but Natasha is getting more and more cohesive and more and more oppressive. A bad intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver gray, purple two kinds of pupil color back and forth several times, gradually blended together, Natasha's momentum, will, body seems to condense into a whole She screamed with great enthusiasm, striding forward, holding the "Thunder Sword" in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loud drink made Todd’s screaming loudly loud and loud, and no longer heard other sounds, before it could defend against the “Thunder Sword” deafness effect. The body could not offset Natasha's drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tinnitus did not affect Todd’s perfect defense, the left-handed square shield lifted Natasha’s attack, and the right hand held the blood. The light swords are crossed, and they are defended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sword was only halfway, Todd unexpectedly saw Natasha’s body appear to be transparent, and the long sword As if from another world, a illusory crack appeared on the shield and suddenly spread to Todd's body in an unstoppable trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Todd was smashed into two halves of the body to make the final panic question, followed by a few clicks, and the blood of the waist The long sword fell to the ground together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha gasped for a few breaths, then couldn’t attend to the physical condition and hurried back to prepare to help Lucien kill the darkness knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Natasha returned to the ambushing Black Forest and saw Lucien fall to the ground. Aaron held a black dagger and stabbed it from the right. Worried that she was about to rescue, she was surprised to find that Lucien took a dark red bracelet from the dirt and inspired "Fireball" to kill Aaron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did you bury a good magic item here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This hand The ring is a bit familiar. It seems to be the 'Women's bracelet' mentioned in the 'Professor' murder event material?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the horse The Black Forest across the Sol River is once the underground remains of the hiding place before the Silver White."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless memories pouring into Natasha’s mind and encircling the silver The corners of the incident suddenly emerged one after another. Many details that were not considered problematic before began to show the other side of it. For example, Lucien’s medicinal agents that stimulate blood power, such as missing the silver horned cultists, such as not killing The prison guards who took the hostages... There are so many details linked together, there are only two possibilities, or the relationship between Professor and Lucien is close to the degree of willingness to save for him, or Professor Luis, Lucy. En is a professor, and the chase is chased by a night watchman who is a common knight. Hurriedly fled to view, Natasha prefer the latter, after all, looks very powerful magic that can be applied Apprentice special magic principle, which in Holm and there have been few examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Natasha's beautiful eyes are like the purple lake in the same storm, the waves are undulating, and the emotions in the bottom of my heart are completely leaked out. There are shocks, surprises, disbelief, anger, sadness and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will do it?" Lucien holds the bracelet of the weaver, ready to inspire "Yangyan Bodyguard" and "Fireball". Although they are hard to come by in front of Natasha, the current five-level strength, but Lu Xi's name is definitely not to give up directly, and no effort is made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is nervous but not flustered, and even has a peculiar calm: "To delay the time, you must say something to delay the time, as long as the 'vampire blood' three The effect of the minute dragged on and the matter was solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after a brief silence, Lucien was prepared to open up another story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, Natasha’s eyes were calm and deep again, and the voice squirmed a few words: “Go to Holm.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Lucien didn't respond to Natasha for a while, only then found that Natasha's eyes seemed to have a little change in color. It was a dreamy purple color, not a silver ash that was indifferent to the blood force, but a silvery purple that was pure and clear, but it was as if it could be seen at a glance and there was an indescribable depth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to Holm, the headquarters of the mainland magic parliament is there, if you want to concentrate on the magical road like Silvia, it will be the most The place that suits you.” Natasha repeated it with a hoarse and low voice, then her eyes lifted up, revealing a lazy and dangerous smile. “Dear Professor, you are a superb master, I don’t think so. An opera actor can match you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I don't want to lie to you, but life is always full of helplessness." Lucien sees Natasha The smile is dangerous but it doesn't mean to be hands-on. It is a little relieved and can be delayed by dialogue until the end of three minutes. That is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and laughed at herself: "My friends are cheating on me, I am used to it. But I understand you, you play "Sorrow" The pain of depression at the time I can clearly feel that Aalto is not a place to learn magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mind if I am a magician?" Lucien From the previous Natasha's attitude towards Silvia's learning of magic, she can see that she has no extreme disgust and hatred for the magician, but before Sylvia's betrayal, what is Natasha's mind? Hard to guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha licked her lips and answered seriously: "My mother is a genius magician, so I never thought that the magician must be evil." Judging the good and evil of a person, not by looking at his identity, but by seeing what he did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiles softly, shallow A touch of touch: "Although I am very angry and very sad, Lucien, you are deceiving me and using me, but in retrospect, you have never tried to hurt me, and you are really trying to help me. Before you obviously have The opportunity to leave me to leave, but still fools carrying me to continue to escape. In fact, when I met you in the wilderness, I think you may be a magician, many details of the escape also exposed this point, But I have never linked you to a professor who killed many night watchmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the night watcher doesn't want to arrest me, he won't die. And in my heart, compared with others, my loved ones, friends Life is certainly more precious. "Lucien did not want to lose his friend Natasha, she presented their ideas at the same time that lies before clearance inside self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three minutes passed, Natasha did not seem to have changed abnormally. Lucien heard her heavy exhalation in a slight surprise:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I know that you are a bloody professor, I still want to be friends with you. No matter, the night watchers are not my loyal knights."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing this sentence, Natasha seems to have got rid of the struggle and become free and easy again. She slowly walked in front of Lucien, revealing that Lucien is familiar. Teasing smile: "Dear Professor, what other things are you lying about? For example, have you never had a love experience? For example, never took a girl's hand? I think you seem to have a lot of experience, whether it is love or composition. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
