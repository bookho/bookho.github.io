			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices exclaimed, all looked over, no I think that in the atmosphere of depression and almost solidification, some people dare to stand up and face such a terrible and so crazy Felipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the steady pace of the professor’s move towards the high platform, the Necromancer and the apprentices have a strong sense of joy, relaxation and dependence, because no one is willing to force And make choices with an arrogant attitude, even if a considerable part of them have measured the pros and cons and decided to join the pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy and inspiration quickly faded, and there was a deep fear and fear in the heart. Can the professor deal with the terrible strength that Felipe showed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little timid "fat" teeth collided and whispered: "Teach... Professor, should... should you be sure?" I don't know him. Is talking to himself or asking for a companion next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Professor is a big man in the purification sequence, of course, no problem." The short "bread" is both comforting the companion and comforting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Red Wine” and “The Grouper” still look at the calm and cold Felipe with fear: “Perhaps, perhaps Mr. Felipe is also a big man in the purification sequence. ...but how would a pale hand send him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the uneasy eyes of Necromancer and apprentices, Lucien boarded the high platform. Going to Felipe, the heart is divided into two halves, the opposite of ice and fire. Half is calm and snowy, and half is a rebound caused by strong pressure. Various evil thoughts are inexplicable. For example, I really want to wave my hand to grieve below. Authentic: "I am late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe's crazy eyes converge, the pupil is deep and calm, but it seems to be more dangerous than before, he elegantly Lu Xien said slightly: "Mr. Professor, what do you want to oppose? I am standing here, there is no way out. If you can't say a reasonable explanation, I think only one of us can continue to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s mouth twitched There are countless self-satisfied answers in the heart: "Don't be so crazy? Don't do it without saying a word... It's not good to fight killing... everyone sat down and talked slowly, seeking a win-win path..." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-tune to self-report, Lucien understands that this is the best way to get rid of the current dangerous situation, so try to make your own language temperature and introversion:" I am from the 'Elemental Will' and have no idea what to do with the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not irritate Felipe completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe has a slight glimpse, what does the professor mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sorcerers and apprentices who are looking forward to Lucy’s body, such as Sethi and Tess, are even more stunned, saying: "Mr. Professor, you have nothing." What did the idea stand up against? And, he turned out to be a magical organization... or an elemental system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s words turned: "But I don't I really like Mr. Felipe's way of forcing you, everyone here has the right to make their own choices. Whether it is difficult to break through here and continue to live a life without darkness, or follow you to Allinge, use yourself The 'sacrifice and pay' in exchange for a large number of benefits, should let them choose their own, bear the corresponding consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Professor, you are very Ok." Felipe took the lead to applaud gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his eyes stared at Lucien without a smile: "But if I disagree?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Lucien’s answer is a little wrong for him and he will immediately start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to have not noticed the dangerous oppression given by Felipe, still calmly and calmly smiled: "And, I have just said to Mr. Felipe. The evaluation of elemental magic is very disapproving and I want to discuss this issue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What evaluation?" Felipe felt that she could not keep up with the professor. The idea was that the choice of Necromancer and apprentices was still discussed in a tit-for-tat manner, and it was inexplicably transferred to the elemental magic, which eased his ready-to-go state again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Mr. Felipe. You think that elemental magic is difficult to evaluate the body alone. You think that the fundamentals of the human body are vitality. Without its integration, it is impossible to practice (sincere-ren) any other thing. Whether it's blood, muscles, or all kinds of impurities, right?" Lucien asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe didn’t expect Lucien to want to debate this issue with himself. He laughed and said: "Of course it is. The mystery of the human body is not for you to play with." The destruction of the elements can be understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, the results of human research from the ancient magical empire, to the current parliamentary internals of the parliament on similar issues The general view, I can't find any point that makes me doubt the basis of this evaluation. Even the church recognizes that vitality is the essence of the human body. Without vitality, it is impossible to regenerate limbs, but they think that vitality is God's gift. We are still looking for answers from the exploration of nature and the source of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few decades ago, several high-level magicians tried to use After the elements have been used to refine the muscles of the human body, the elements of the magicians have not acknowledged this point of view. Do you want to publish a novel idea that overturns the research results of all the arcians and magicians?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felipe series of words like so many overwhelming the sharp knife throwing to Lucien, full of flavor aggressive. This is not because he despised the professor, but for a long-standing ingrained concept. "The theory of human life mechanics" is one of the basic theories of the Necromancer magic, laid the foundation from the ancient magic empire. If it is overthrown, the mystery of the human body and life will once again become unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding Necromancers and apprentices are all smiling and afraid to laugh, they have not experienced the era of arcane knowledge explosion, they The attitude of ancient magic books such as "The Book of Necronomics" is like the devout believers facing "The Holy Scriptures", "The Theory of Human Body Mechanics" is one of the foundations of "The Holy Scriptures", so naturally it is definitely more than Felipe. It is absurd to think that the professor’s questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the professor is not helping them against Felipe, I believe that many people will be full of anger, because this is a provocation to "Dead Magic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Viscount of Karendia, who has been in the leisurely play mode, frowned, which is a bit of subversive arcane common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw his own doubts successfully transferred Felipe’s attention, and his heart shook his fist and waved: “Sure enough, according to Felipe’s It is said that a magician with a very strong age and a strong strength must have a degree far superior to others in the mastery of the corresponding arcane. Felipe himself is fully qualified. And this person’s interest in arcane is absolutely high. When confronted with doubts about being good at arcane, there must be a strong reaction over other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking around the hall, the eyes fell on Sidney It seems to be the stitched face: "It seems that only Mr. Sidney agrees with my doubts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the only person whose expression has not changed, others wear The only horns of the hooded apprentices and apprentices have been raised, and the two gloomy Necromancers of Sethi and Tess can't help but sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Mr. Professor, my face can't make any expression because of the sequela of the conversion ceremony." Sidney answered with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗哧", a low laugh came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head unconsciously, looking at Felipe, who was very light and ironic, and his voice was very light and gentle: "Felipe Sir, if I say that I can use only simple elements or inanimate substances to refine (sincere-ren) bodies, do you believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Earth In the field of organic matter (the body is mainly composed of organic matter) is also occupied by the theory of life mechanics for a long time, but with the organic synthesis of urea, acetic acid and other organic matter in the 19th century, this mysterious surname is completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice is not small, but the scene becomes quiet and extremely quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe suddenly felt that the professor in front of him was more crazy than himself. What purpose did he want to achieve with a hustle and bustle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Felipe’s laughter broke the sudden silence, “Mr. Professor, if you don’t rely on a living substance, you can make it. Group (Cheng-Ren) body things, then I think your research results will definitely sensationalize the entire Allinge, sensational of the entire Magic Council, enough to qualify for the 'Holm Crown' award. But, until now' No one in the Holm Crown Awards list relies on such research to get a ring. And I also think that no one can rely on similar research results to win, because this is the 'privilege' of the Necromancer. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
