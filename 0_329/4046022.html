			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled and said: "There is a guardian home in the Knights Code, guarding the weak two. I don't think I have violated it. Sir Wien must understand, compare it, If you are a gangster, it doesn't seem to be trustworthy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no evidence!" Jackson is seemingly fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people know that it is a gang’s trick to make all witnesses unwilling or afraid to testify, and the church generally does not get involved in this kind of thing, let’s say, Aaron’s gang The big man behind him is not influential in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed and recalled the lines of various bullies and knights that he had heard and seen before, and said with a high attitude: "Evidence? He is a knight attendant, you are a gang leader, this is evidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Copper Crown Tavern, Lucien knows in the Principality of Vaoliit, The knights are real aristocrats. Their official attendants, although not high in status, are definitely not low. Therefore, it is believed that Jackson’s gangster is not qualified to frame a knight’s attendant. After all, he and John have no other The great benefit of the Aaron gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s against John, who has always been influenced by the spirit of the Cavaliers and the code, and the same is true of Eliza’s cousin, so it’s inevitable that he was caught by Jackson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson was blocked by Lucian’s words, silenced, and a knight attendant, for the Aaron gang, it is indeed possible, but The relationship and resources that need to be used will be very many. How can Aaron’s boss be able to shoot for such a small leader? Especially the atmosphere of Aalto seems to be a bit strange. Under the calm, there are many undercurrents, even Aaron’s boss. They are all secrets all day long, and they don’t know what they are planning, so he just really scared John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, this is not a bloody vengeance. There is no need to gamble on your own future and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boss, Jackson naturally lost his enthusiasm for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Jackson asked with a hard time: "How much compensation do you need? I have only two Yinnars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;?;&nbsp; Lucien sees himself succeeding in scaring Jackson, turning his head to look at John, letting him decide, and looking at the end of the street at the same time, whispering: "It seems that the magistrate brought someone over, we Hurry and leave, lest things get too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Aaron gangs, these people do not have to deal with the sheriff, it is not difficult to think of reasons to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucian is somewhat worried about the secret revenge of the gang, he occasionally thinks about completely suppressing or severing the possibility of the aftermath, but at this time, whether he is John or not Strength is not enough to complete, and when the street kills, it will really hurt John to be expelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John was obsessed with the Knights Code and did not think about extorting Jackson. He nodded: "Okay, pay for two Yinnar."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was only robbed of more than forty Tong Fei and some untreated garbage, and the rest of the money was carefully and carefully hidden in a corner of the witch ruins. Because of fear of witches and fear of being cursed, the villains did not dare to approach, so they did not find that, together with the furniture that was broken, at least one Yinnar was a little more, and the compensation for the two Yinnar was doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson laboriously took out the purse and threw it to John, which was empty, only two Yinnar: "Tongfel was just awarded to them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John poured out two beautiful silver-colored coins, handed them to Lucien, and threw the purse at Jackson's hand: "Would you like those villains?" Searching for a search, will you take back the copper rifle you were robbed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Silverar, Lucien chin is getting closer and closer to the law and order The officer and his subordinates raised their spirits: "It’s too late, let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although being held in person by the magistrate, there may not be any punishment. But be careful, Lucien couldn't dare to take John's future to gamble, so he didn't have much heartache to give up those lovely copper fairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good!" John picked up the stick, leaving no physical evidence, and Lucien picked up the dagger that Jackson had fallen out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, don't run, almost, take a break." Lucien sees that he has ran back to a remote corner of the slum and finally I put my heart down, helped the wall, and gasped with a big mouth, only to find that my legs were very soft. I counted it. I really ran a lot of road this morning, so I just sat directly on the ground with a little Said with a smile, "Oh, no strength, call."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John also gasped, seeing the two wounds on Lucien is not deep, bleeding has been Stop, so I sat down and leaned on Lucien: "I didn't have much strength. I was surrounded by them for only a few tens of seconds. It was more tired than running for a long time. However, I haven’t been so happy for a long time. It’s really comfortable!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two just sit on the ground, gasping and recovering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s so comfortable." Lucien squinted and looked up at the clear blue sky. Just this frame, for myself, There is a feeling of heartyness, like venting all the repression, pain, confusion, and jealousy from this time, the unprecedented clarification of the mind, and truly recognizing the good friend of John, so I can’t help but laugh. "Ha ha ha ha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter is pleasant and enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is very strange: "Lusien, what are you laughing at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am at After thinking about it, I learned the words and made money. I went to travel around the mainland to see different landscapes, different foods, different countries and various wonderful legends."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer, but looked at the sky and slowly spoke, but in my heart, I silently went on:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I want to learn magic, I want to travel all over the continent, explore the knowledge and laws of this world, and penetrate the truth of this world to find the way home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Whether it is unsuccessful, this is the direction of my efforts, for my parents and former friends like John."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are already three more Yinna Well, even if you borrow the usury, you have to get together as soon as possible so that you can start learning magic in the shortest time. The Aaron gang will not dare to retaliate, but you can do it in secret. They are good at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were beaten under the Aaron gang, Lucien decided to learn magic because of external pressure and negative emotions. And the yearning for strength, status, good life, wonderful enjoyment, etc., now, it is completely rooted, from the heart of the decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John said with a smile: "Going to travel around the mainland? Oh, Lucien, although the mainland countries in the east of the Principality, the dark creatures, Warcraft have almost been extinct by the church. But the wild is still not safe. Those kobolds, goblins, and gnolls will give birth just like mice. They will kill themselves. It will not be long before they can come out. With your strength, I am afraid I cannot travel alone." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kobold, Goblin, Gnoll, Hey, can you eat?" Lucien asked subconsciously, to eliminate this fast-growing creature. The first thought is to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is somewhat inexplicable and cannot understand Lucien’s thinking: “Should...no.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's it." Lucien was slightly disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John didn’t ask much, he looked up at the sapphire sky and said with sorrow: “If I can become a formal knight, I will also cruise the mainland, no Knowing what is going to be outside of Aalto, is it as wonderful as those of the bard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Lucien, Recently, you have to be careful, try not to go outside the city or in a secluded place. The villains are the real scum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, John, wait for you to see To Sir Wien, be sure to take the initiative to bring up today and ask for punishment." Lucien glared at John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is strange first, then nodded: "Okay. Oh, unfortunately, after I became a high-ranking knight, I can learn some military-related text. Otherwise, I can teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
