			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful melody reverberates in the dining room, and the quiet and serene notes make people feel unpredictable, but there is no small indoor band around. Only one magic phonograph placed on a table against the wall slowly turned the gum black plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the music gradually subsided, the black disk turned, and the servant next to it quickly changed one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the music sounded again, John put down the knife and fork in his hand and sighed slightly to Lucien: "Ordinary gum black disk can only record for a few minutes. Music, it is difficult to present a complete symphony, unless a higher level of pure magic black disk, but this is something that ordinary people can't afford."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not Forgetting about my past life, I am very concerned about ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is that ordinary people can't even use the magic phonograph." Lucien cuts the foie gras while joking. "Of course, pure magic black." The price of the plate is not cheap, it is equivalent to a second-level alchemy item. The small aristocrats can only buy one item occasionally. Most of the time, they have to use the gum black plate, but the Viscounts of Welshley should not exist. The problem.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a combination of magic, Lucien himself has no mature plan, can only redesign and arrange the magic array according to the concept, can not be done overnight, must Step by step.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Joel became a director of the Rantat Musicians Association, the whole person became full of energy, as if even aging was delayed: "But The number of small nobility is far more than that of the big nobility. In addition to the use of most restaurants, the black plate of gum has become the undisputed mainstream and is an important source of income for most musicians. Therefore, I find that they are getting more and more a simple piece of music that tends to create a few minutes Both easy and lucrative income. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart's musicians are no more than Aalto, the chances of concerts are not so much, the past income is mainly from serving the nobility, serving as their music consultant Or the chief musicians and the like. After the invention of the magic phonograph, they added another important channel, that is, the "music usage fee", which extracts a certain amount of money according to the sales of the gum black disk and the magic black disk filled with their own music. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a "patent fee" precedent for magic exchange and use, plus "Atom Control", you are also a big musician, the magicians are "music" The fee for use is not exclusive. Except for the division of musicians according to 369, etc., the different proportions of shares are prescribed, and the Intellectual Property Act passed by the aristocratic House and signed by the Queen is normally implemented.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current magic phonograph is only enjoyed by the nobility, but the price is high, but also the musicians have gained a lot. So, under the stimulation of money, under the influence of the "light music" trend most Lejia is increasingly accepting a few minutes of short music, and this simple and uncomplicated "casual music" has also been welcomed by the general public, making Rentart's music development trend more and more different from Aalto.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words of Lucien, Rantart became the place where pop music and pop songs were born sooner.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the fear of Uncle Joel, Lucien smiled: "Sometimes, the transformation of musical instruments, the transformation of the form of music, and the transformation of the form of music will affect the direction of music, such as the music of the lyre era. The music after the invention of the violin and the music after the invention of the piano, only in this process of constant change, the music can live forever, instead of being exhausted, so Uncle Joel, don’t worry that the capacity of the black plastic disc is too small. There is a short trend in music development, which allows us to see more different music than the current imagination. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most prestigious big musicians are so eloquent about this point of view, Joel himself is a bard and a street performer, for short music. With natural preferences, I no doubt think about turning the topic into the food itself: "I don't think of a small Evans. You have the talent of food. This sour and sweet meat is so delicious! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. "Alice's mouth is no longer nodding. She was completely focused on the food after she tasted these dishes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the table, except foie gras With a small amount of Tria-style dishes, most of the foods she has never seen before, have never enjoyed it, and the food style of any country is very different, so that she can eat as much as she is fat and hobby. Can't stop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is good at magic, good at identifying animals and plants, and here there are many strange things that are not on earth, so the "hunting range" of Chinese dishes has once again expanded, and the number of varieties has at least tripled. , what is the braised thorn tree, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Natasha, Joel said something strangely: "Why didn't Her Majesty come tonight?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, as long as he is in Aringe, Lucien will visit the Joel family at least twice a month, and Natasha will come with it most of the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also had a chance to answer in the future, John said first: "Recently, Rantart is undergoing urban reconstruction, and Fan Da will be re-arranged. And the magic array, because of the villas, real estate and manor involving many nobles, the aristocratic House often quarrels, so the Queen is very busy, must be coordinated and shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The change of Rentat is too fast. The changes I have experienced in Aalto for more than 20 years have not happened much in Lentat in a few months. I don’t know what Lentart will look like in the future.” Joe Some are very emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Lucien and John stood by a glass of wine to the floor-to-ceiling window of the small living room on the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the lights outside the aristocratic area of ​​the Milky Way, John suddenly sighed: "From the moment you were implicated by the witch, I felt like I was dreaming." The dream that has not yet awakened today, all expectations for the future are realistic, but not as expected, but deviate greatly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Also." Lu Xien looked out of the window, his eyes became deep and deep, but his tone was plain, but he was really from the heart, and the dream was not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the exploration and study of the world, Lucien has basically ruled out the possibility of dreams, but other similar 'real, but still lacking decisive The evidence is denied. Even if I have already had a preliminary guess about the world, I cannot completely conclude that the "brain in the tank", "virtual world", and "experimental place" are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John naturally couldn’t hear Lucan’s words. After a sip of red wine, “My first dream was to be a real knight, let my father and mother Ivan, you and you all live a rich aristocratic life, but who knows that you have accomplished this goal before me and become a musician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When I became a knight, I was ready to sacrifice the fortress in the North or the Dark Mountain. This is the home of the knight, but you told me that you are a magician, and I am in a long-term confusion..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I thought we would never meet again and began to work for the Principality and the Church with peace of mind, Her Majesty took me to Rentat... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he laughed: "When I am used to this kind of strong guardian, I don't have to face too much danger, I can safely When I passed the second half of my life, there were frequent incidents of worshipping the devil, the devil, and the abyss in the kingdom. I must Wave processing, facing the battle again and again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not complain, but a little excitement, completely stable, no life, let him stop, can not stop Become a day knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life is always full of surprises, not going according to what you expected." Lucien and John touched the glass, "And, you're eliminated, blood It is very difficult to promote the Knights of the Heavens, and there is not enough information in the Kingdom for you to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of bloody aristocrats in a generation or the exploration of an epic knight Underneath, there are the best tempering methods for their own blood and the way to reconcile with the will, so it is also a knight, the aristocrats with inheritance are easier to promote than the new aristocrats, so they agree that the magic parliament announced the training before the knight. The method is to train more talents against the church and develop more and more different spaces. This blood tempering method is their true capital and the secret that must be strictly conservative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "elimination" of the blood itself is rare, and it has been basically absorbed into the ranks of the church's holy knights or night watchmen, so the nobility of the Holm kingdom is not one. This is the blood, and naturally there is no corresponding method of tempering to John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Lu Xien did not put this problem in mind, because the blood power was made by the ancient magicians, and the various bloodlines were preserved in the parliament. According to the data, John can design a reasonable tempering method by studying the situation of “eliminating” the blood. However, there is no information about “eliminating” the blood in the materials collected by the parliament, which makes Lucien suspect the source of this blood. It is considered to be the result of Viken's research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
