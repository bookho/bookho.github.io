			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After introducing Marcus, Victor smiled and pointed to Lucien: "He is the Lucien Evans that I often tell you, the symphony of destiny. The creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Marcus." Lucien stood up with Victor and nodded to Marcus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus with a self-satisfied smile: "Hello, Lucien, you can call me Marcus directly. When I was in the Shaq Kingdom, I often hear your reputation. When I arrived at Aalto, I wanted to visit you for the first time. But Victor's teacher told me not to bother you to prepare for the first concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first words of the first game, Marcus's tone is slightly heavier, it seems that he subconsciously feels that there is no concert experience in Lucian, and is not worthy of the title of "musician". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien politely replied: "Marcus, I often listen to you from Victor, saying that you are a good musician, only two At the age of fourteen, I have had a lot of experience in concerts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is so much concert experience, mainly because this tour has received a lot The invitation of the nobility." This is Marcus's most proud thing, the smile has become a little brighter, then sit down on the other side of Victor, show off his concert experience to Lucien, and the knowledge of different countries, such as advocating Love, enthusiasm and openness of the ancient kingdom of Syrah, such as the rigorous old-fashioned, rigid and rigid sacred Heilz empire, such as the savage kingdom of the Shakes of the Warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is very interested in this matter, so he accompanies Marcus and let him talk endlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hall is quiet and the concert is about to begin, Marcus stops telling and thinks: "Lu Xien is not as I imagined. Pride is shallow, it seems to get along very well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Marcus in the Kingdom of Shak knew his teacher Victor in the "Music Review" and "The Symphony Herald" When the hall successfully held a concert and taught a talented musician, it was a heartfelt joy and blessing. As you look at the two newspapers, you can see that each comment is unconcealed by Lucien. Praise, even the highest degree of praise, as more and more people around him take the same as Victor's disciple, he compares with Lucien, the balance in Marcus's mind becomes unbalanced, like being counted by countless mice. Tearing the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I wait for him to successfully hold a concert and compare it? Is the genius of a falling meteor still less?" Marcus thought of the strangers. The eyes and secret whispers in the dark, just a little bit of a good impression on Lucien, the court music consultant in the Shaq Kingdom should have been a peak in his life, but because of Lucien's fame and others often The comparison is very torturous, like a downright loser, "and he is so arrogant and too arrogant that he is so arrogant and too arrogant at such an important concert that he is destined to suffer. Failed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus’s hostility to Lucien was deeply hidden, and Victor did not notice that he saw the symphony orchestra is ready, old but 矍铄Christopher stood in front of the stage wearing a black tuxedo, so he would straighten his back like everyone else and show his respect for Christopher with his own dedication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipal Plaza, Felice, Lott, Piola, Grace, and other audiences all hold their breath, waiting for the beginning of the concert with respect . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the most noble people such as Vaughan Grand Duke, Princess Natasha, and Prince Michel are expressing their respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Aalto Musicians Association, the most famous and authoritative musician in the entire continent, a living music legend, is about to start the last concert in his life. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in my concert. It’s been fifty years since I set foot on the road to music. The ten-year-old is still standing here. In addition to your support, and because of a genius stimulation, the road he created has made me find the passion to re-create music, like an 18-year-old boy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will age, we will die, but music will not, music will never die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Christopher made a concise statement for his last concert, then turned around in the applause, and the right hand with the baton gently rose with the left hand, and the music rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a piece of music that has been performed many times in the past, from father to generation. This is a lot of people's memories of the past, this is the power of classics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symphony movement has a short break and a long break between each, it seems that the whole Aalto is bursting with applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ended the three symphonies, Christopher was slightly exhausted: "The next time my student Silvia brought her to everyone. Piano Sonata, I will prepare for the fourth symphony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Christopher going down, nobles and musicians in the Hall of St. They all seem a little melancholy, like what is lost, and the city square is more admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a classic work, Mr. Christopher is a living music legend." Piola said with a smile to Sharon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon seriously nodded: "I just listened to the three works that I grew up, and I was able to attend Mr. Christopher’s concert in person. The most honored thing in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great musicians who can be called 'masters' are rare even in the long history, but I I think Mr. Christopher is qualified to be called this way.” Grace and others are also full of respect and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white evening dress, like an angel coming to the world, Silvia came to the stage, sitting on the piano, slender and beautiful hands on the keys , started his own performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her teacher's introduction and help to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast-slow-fast three-sounding sonatas are beautiful and beautiful, with the beauty and temperament of Silvia, so that everyone can be intoxicated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien closed his eyes and listened quietly, and his heart was slightly regrettable. Silvia’s piano sonatas have not escaped the influence and limitations of past music and musical instruments. There is no advantage in being able to take advantage of the wide range of piano sounds, strength and weakness, and contrasting clarity. It is good but still stays in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she played for the first time in the Hall of the Holy Ghost, and it is already very good to have such works and performances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the ten-minute sonata, Silvia received a warm applause, which made her a little excited, and raised the skirt frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the applause, Lucien suddenly felt a gaze on himself, so he looked back and happened to collide with Natasha's smiling purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded with a smile. Lucien read her meaning and thanked herself for guiding Sylvia's piano adaptation, creation and playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is worthy of being the most beautiful musician." On the Municipal Square, countless male surnames and female surnames were born when Silvia played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After a rest, Christopher returned to the stage, and after paying tribute, he turned his face with a serious expression and waved his baton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two distinct notes make everyone feel refreshed, and then the melody unfolds, creating a feeling of being on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the horn-like high sounds, everyone seems to be excited, and there seems to be a magnificent war picture, under the leadership of countless heroes. The pastors, knights, etc. are united, rushing forward like the tide, cutting down the giant's head, smashing the towers of the evil magician, and destroying the demons and demons who have come to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following is a sad and sad movement, like mourning heroes, graceful and soothing, followed by vigorous development, and tragic, vast, and enthusiastic The epic victory melody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whole symphony of more than 40 minutes ended, Victor and other talents woke up and stood up and gave Christopher the warmest applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a theme music, this is an outstanding, excellent symphony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
