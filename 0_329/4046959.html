			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mathematics knowledge of Hathaway’s learning is very advanced for his peers, in the eyes of Douglas and Fernando, this is really not worth anything. He spent too much brain power, so Hathaway continually flipped through the books, constantly pointing at one of the questions with a slender finger, and then waiting for a standard, simple answer, and every time, she was not disappointed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating honey-roasted fish, the Knight of the Knights who drank the spirits, was gradually attracted by the situation here, forgetting to talk to the old Green, Slightly frowning, carefully looking at Douglas and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of a little excitement, Hathaway’s face was slightly more rosy than before, after a long time, she closed the book, bowed her head and whispered Sentence: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando just wants to laugh at the two sentences, Sharp suddenly put down his glass of wine, stood up from the high chair, hehe smiled: "Old Green, I can't think of your guests here, besides being philosophers, or mathematicians, I think it is better than those of the court teachers..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words were directed at Old Green, but a pair of blue-clear eyes were staring at Douglas and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green picked up the cup that Sharp was drinking, put it in the sink and muttered, and muttered: "What a strange thing, a lot of guys who are good at mathematics have a little Philosophical thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, mathematics is the ultimate embodiment of philosophy." Douglas laughed in the words of Old Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and twisted his head to the side, a disdain to talk to the barbarian of Sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp snorted, no longer staring at Douglas and Fernando, but slowly walking to the side of Hathaway, smiling and watching her eat small A little bit of honey-roasted fish: "Haiweiwei, how is the taste of grilled fish here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Facing his own knight teacher, the sea Serva is still concise and will not say more than half a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the taste, we should leave, you have to go back to dinner, I can't let them know that I am eating with you." Sharp smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatherville took off the white handcuffs hanging on the left side of the knight’s suit, wiped his mouth and smothered it, then nodded gently: “Yeah.”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get your knight sword, don't discard it, but remember, you can't influence yourself for it. The knight's life lies in his own creed, his own spirit. , his own will, not the sword in his hand." Sharp finally taught Hathaway two sentences for the previous things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri picked up a sword that was taller than herself, and her brows were wrinkled. It seems that there is still no way to endorse this statement, but she did not directly refute it, but only slightly Contemplatively and slyly following Sharp's door to the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just took the door, she suddenly turned her head, still no expression, but the indifference in the silver-gray eyes seemed to be softer, then she A slight dagger against Douglas and Fernando seems to be once again to thank them for their guidance on mathematical issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they went away, Fernando said with a half-smile: "The ash of silver, the cold and cold eyes, she is the Hoffenberg family." Descendants? Don't know what is the relationship with the 'Sword of Truth?'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his eye looked at Old Green, waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sword of Truth" is Holm King Williamson? Hoffenberg's title, he is a legend more powerful than the "heart of time" Ketonia, the first knight to follow the "Truth of God" against the rule of the magical empire, so the "God of Truth" deliberately lowered the grace "Give" to him an epic sword that is consistent with his blood, which is also named "Sword of Truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to know." Old Green didn't raise his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "This kind of thing is very good to investigate, not everyone thinks it is a secret like the old guy who died like you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Fernando rang the door of Douglas, because he woke up and found himself on a magic problem With new ideas, I came forward to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit, my opinion yesterday was a little wrong..." The door was just opened, Fernando said sincerely, but he said half of his words. And because there is more than Douglas in the room, "Vice President, how come you are here again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the chair in front of the desk is the first few Vice President Rigg, who was "roaring" by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't I come?" Rig touched his eagle hook nose and his voice was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted, just about to ridicule Rieg's face, but was interrupted by Douglas: "President Rieg is here to explain my mission." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Task? What mission requires you to do this nine-ring Master? Studying Aringe?" Fernando's expression began to become serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled peacefully: "Let me find a way to become a Mathematical teacher of Hathaway, privately, and by the way, measure her magical talent, if Guide her to the path of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her's position in the Hoffenberg family is high?" Fernando's first reaction was this, for There is no doubt that the trade unions have drawn up the nobility’s program of action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her father is the smallest and mostloved child of the "Sword of Truth", called Ludwig, and was also placed second in the Hoffenberg family. The knight of the legendary strong hope, unfortunately, he died unexpectedly in a certain relic, so the 'Sword of Truth' transferred his feelings to his only daughter, Hathaway, very loving, completely did not dislike her lack of knight Talent.” Rig’s voice introduced the general situation without any ups and downs. After all, Fernando participated in the “teaching” of Hathaway yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando grinned: "Why don't you let me go? I think I will be a very good teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just said casually, the relative age is still very small, he has not yet taught the students' ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You? Hehe." Rig did not smile and answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas also shook his head in a slight imperfection. It seems that Fernando, who is also violent, cannot be a good teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and expressed strong dissatisfaction with their attitude. He attacked: "Sharp is probably the golden knight, and he was carefully identified by him. That would bring serious consequences of the collapse of the entire trade union. Moreover, the 'Sword of Truth' is a very very devout believer. Even if it really tempts Hathaway to go on the magical path, I suspect that he will not secretly support us, but directly kill He has always been very decisive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pious believers and qualified kings are always contradictory. I noticed that the sword of truth is more The more like the latter," Rigg said with a deep meaning, then stood up and walked outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stunned, and after he crossed himself, he said, "It’s not that stupid..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top breakfast at the "Grilled Fish Inn" is a piece of white bread, a butter and a grilled fish, and Fernando muttered "How is it again?", eating while eating a big mouth, for him who has not held any life extension ceremony, the appetite is as strong as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After swallowing a few mouthfuls of food, Fernando struggled to separate his mind and vaguely asked: "How do you plan to become a mathematics teacher in Heather's private school? Since her status is so important, I don't think that the 'Azure Devil' Sharp will let her stay with a stranger and let you guide her to the path of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has figured out the identity of Sharp, the deputy head of the "Sword of Truth" Knights, the nine-level gold knight "Azure Gift", and among the magicians, this title was replaced by "Azure Demon" This shows how many wizards he has killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando poured his own ale: "It's not so reckless..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of the semi-closed small hotel was gently ringed, then Dressed up in a little princess costume, Hathaway walked in with a light blue cover book, still Qi Liuhai, shawl hair, and behind her, the nose of the raised shoulders of the shoulders behind, like laughing and laughing Followed by the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Hathaway ran lightly to the "table" of Douglas and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the same foot..." Fernando still owes it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Hathaway to slow down the pace and slowly walked over to the two people, spreading the books out of the empty space of the table, turning it over long ago. Fold a good page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thin fingers poked one of the topics, the palm of her face raised slightly, and looked at Douglas and Fernando with a pair of indifferent silver-grey eyes. Did not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This topic..." Fernando spoke first, and at the same time secretly glanced at Douglas, look at it, you don't have to find a way to see Hathaway again. She came to the door herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp walked inadvertently to the old Green, sat in a high chair, asked for a glass of spirits, and sipped while watching the "teaching" of the three . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Douglas and Fernando answered the question of Hathaway with all their heart and soul. She is not limited to the original topic, but in the process of explanation. Constantly in-depth exploration, and put forward problems that do not exist in the book, of course, this is difficult to do Douglas and Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as noon, Hathaway put away his books, paper, quills and ink bottles, carefully curled his legs, and used a cool, soft voice. Thank you, just like facing a real teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay here for a month, if I have any questions, I can’t see the children who are so loved by mathematics." Douglas said deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei nodded lightly and motioned to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp then laughed: "Would you like to make Hathaway’s tutor directly? I think this is better than any work you have done before." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t wait for Douglas’s answer, just like turning a joke and turning away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching them go, Fernando snorted: "Things are easier than imagined, she is really loved by mathematics!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked thoughtfully at the corner where Sharp and Hathaway disappeared, and ignored Fernando’s problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the two returned to the room to continue their communication and study. Apart from lunch and dinner, they never stepped out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s until the dead of night, Fernando’s departure, Douglas’s screaming for the forehead, looking out the starry sky, even if he’s the Archmage, Such high-intensity thinking and communication also made him feel unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tomorrow seems to be a sunny one..." The night is like a curtain, and the stars are dotted, Douglas whispers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, all the stars are covered with a layer of blue color, oh, like the reflection of the sea, then, the sound of the tidal waves coming from the sky The sea is falling, the water curtain is falling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas responded extremely quickly, with a huge translucent palm in front of him, blocking the tide, and then he made a circle Another circle of silver lightning, Zizzi poured into the rushing "sea water". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Douglas’s figure disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the blue water faded like an illusion, and the sound of Sharp’s smile and laughter came from all directions:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
