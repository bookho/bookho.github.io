			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather-like scorpion-like flail is very heavy, and the power of Lucien can’t be easily waved, and the two elements that are attached to the skull are equally powerful. Big, far more than Lucien's "acid splash" and "blazing glue." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a piece that was split into many small pieces after being hit by a smash, it burned dust or dissolved into a viscous liquid in the flame and acid. Lu Xien is a little scared: "If you don't have a moonlight and you are directly hit by this flail, I will definitely suffer serious elemental damage. It is definitely not self-healing in a short period of time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if moonlighting greatly weakens the damage of fire, acid, and flail, the remaining physical and lightning damage also makes Lucien a minor injury, even hands and feet now Still trembling, unable to completely eliminate paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have to bathe for at least half an hour of silvermoon to recover." Lucien slaps and takes a tube of "owl" to restore nothing. The great mental power consumed by the spell casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magical attack, all the corpses became a small pool of different colors in less than thirty seconds, and the ashes produced by the fire danced in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen’s black leather armor still retains a few pieces, but the crystal ball was ruined by Lucien without hesitation, worried that it would be evil The followers follow. Then, Lucien kicked the bucket in the cell and disguised as a cult. With the help of the debris, the corpse was washed clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When doing all this, Lucien was always distracted by the sound of explosions and battles on the surface. At this time, their directions and positions appeared extremely The big change, let Lucien know that Camille and the church people have already repelled the people outside the "Silver Point" and are about to chase the remains. So they dare not delay, and they will be unconsciously moved by Joel and Eliza. Return to the side of Ai Wen in the iron railing, then pick up the flail and the debris, go to the door of the "prison", whisper the curse, use the hot and cold changes, display the "blasting technique", blow the dust inside, blow Go outside the corridors and ramps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This apprentice-level magic cannot blow away the smoke caused by supernatural forces, and can only be used in manufacturing atmospheres and in such occasions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handling the scene, Lucien took the flail and rushed to the nearest exit, which is the remote location of the relic palace, exiting the core of the temple, key locations Very far away, leaving here will not encounter cult priests, priests and dark knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there were no such shackles, those corpses would have to be moved out and deal with them." Lucien ran fast and dragged the shadows while recalling the whole process. I am afraid that there will be a leak. "I can do it all. I can only pray that Uncle Joel is not so unlucky. Other cults are busy trying to escape. They should not come to the prison to help." After all, there are Zhan in prison. Sen, the dark knight, is responsible for handling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you directly save the Joel family, you suspect that you will be entangled in Lucien without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afterimage flashed past, and Lussien quickly moved closer to the nearest exit in the ruins and corridors, but let Lucien be surprised that there was no chance To a cultist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the underground palace, since the silver robes high priest Ilya issued an order, the remaining priests, priests, and dark knights began to deal with the traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a stone house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several cultists saw a priest running into his room, squatting on the ground, stretching his hands, and performing the unique "silver-white horn" Etiquette: "Respected Jerome priest, what do you have to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words are not finished yet, their voices are abruptly stopped, a group of black The fog emerged from their bodies, took away all vitality, and then plunged into Jerome's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the frightened, unbelievable distorted expressions of these ordinary people, Jerome’s shrine shrugged his shoulders: “You belong to the traces that need to be dealt with.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of things exceeds the expectations of the high priests of Ilya. At this critical juncture, ordinary cultists must not escape from the church, so they must be "handled" In order to avoid revealing information such as priests, priests and relics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Jerome is too afraid to deal with the room that is too close to the entrance of the forester's cabin. The "dark blue tide" Camille and the two cardinals are chasing from there, even if they want to "see" the true God, get "Eternal silence" can't adopt such a stupid way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, several powerful characters of the sixth and seventh levels fight, the room there will definitely be completely destroyed, no one will survive." Jerome showed up The sorcerer blesses the body, increases speed, and comforts himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The exit from the ruins is very close, and you can even feel the silver moon shining in there, but Lucien suddenly stopped and hid. In a shadowed corner, because of the smell of blood and death from the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien had long expected to encounter cult priests or priests here, he couldn’t help but wonder: "Has there been a fight? The cult guilty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly approaching the exit location, Lucien cautiously eavesdropped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a minute, Lucien heard several footsteps running to the exit, and even the cultists were hiding from Lucien’s shadow. The corners passed, but without exception, they only came to the ground after the exit, and occasionally a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there an ambush? No, the church has come to this exit so quickly, and the style of action is not the same. Is it that the cult is dealing with ordinary believers?" Lucien was a little creepy guess, then no strong, quietly waiting for the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is not a church person, whether it is a cult priest, a priest, or other mysterious person, in the case of Camille, the cardinal, and the night watchman chasing it It will definitely be evacuated in time. It is impossible to make a joke with life. You only need to seize this time difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past one second, the various sounds in the underground ruins came from time to time, and some even got closer and closer, which made Lucien endure. Live a little worried and anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there were supernatural power fluctuations near the exit, and Lucien immediately focused on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a cold voice sounded: "Walk, the high priest of Ilya let us leave immediately, there should be no one who can't come over."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I didn't see Jensen?" Another young but hoarse voice answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold voice is rushing to the ground: "Do you have to wait for him at this time? Whether he is dead or madly rushing to the night watchman, we can no longer Waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, leave." The young hoarse voice also understood the urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the exit was quiet and silent, and Lucien couldn’t judge whether they left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of quiet also makes Lucien breathe a sigh of relief, it seems that the strength of these two cultists has not yet reached the priest level, ruining the exit will cost them very much A lot of work is wasted, so no similar ideas are generated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a solid underground relic is not something that can be destroyed by low-level magic like "micro-effect fossils". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, think about it, this is normal, how the priest-level powerhouse will guard such a remote exit, and most of the priests and grand knights are involved. There is absolutely not much to fight back on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to judge whether the two cultists really left, Lucian was hesitant, but thought that the night watchman who was about to catch up decided to fight together, unless two The cult strongs know in advance that they are hiding here, otherwise they will not delay the time to pretend to leave. After all, the ordinary believers who need to deal with can not find their previous ambush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body glowed with silver, and quickly blurred, Lucien slammed into a shadow and ran to the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moonlight, Lucien’s afterimage is very similar to the incoming silver moon, which is hard to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning over the corner of the ramp, Lucien saw the exit through the moonlight and saw the bushes outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
