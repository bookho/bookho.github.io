			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the purse in your hand and feeling the weight, Lucien is slightly excited and embarrassed, just like on the earth, holding a monthly Thousands of yuan in wages, and the house price is also at this level, suddenly got a huge sum of more than 300,000 yuan, so even if Lucien has been able to keep calm after so many things, it is not small Emotional fluctuations, not to mention the money, also represent the hope that Lu Xien’s self-protection strength will increase rapidly in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that I am also a half-finance." Lucien said in her heart, saying goodbye to Hank, going to the music library on the second floor. After all, I have known Pieru for more than two months. I can barely count as a friend. I still have to tell him when I leave the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hank looked at Lucien’s emotional changes and forced to keep calm, and felt that he smiled and shook his head normally, swearing: “Young and It’s good to be talented.” If Lucien dismissed so many Jintales, or did not change his expression like a dead person, Hank would think he was very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the original should have been thirty-four Quintal, according to the usual practice, Lucien clearly did not ask, Hank certainly I won't mention it myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the music library, Piero sat in a wooden cabinet Behind, there are two newspapers spread out in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Piero." Lucien walked over and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piero seems to be awakened from a dream, a little confused looking at the person in front of him: "Lu Xien..." Just read the name, Pierou face Just sinking, "Maybe I should call you Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude is beyond Lucian’s expectation, because I have been together for more than two months. Lucien is more familiar with Pieru's surname. He doesn't think he is stupid, or blindly arrogant. Even if there is a flaw in his heart, it will not be obvious: "Pieru?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, why are you playing the piano like this? Do you know how to play the harpsichord?!" Pieru said with some teeth, dark brown eyes. Looking at Lucien with disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart moved and looked down at the two newspapers placed in front of Piedru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "Music Review" and "Symbol Guide" that have just been printed and released today. There is a comment on the Victor Piano Concerto in each of the booths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for Lucien to look carefully. The two newspapers that have been deposited in the Soul Library before the past have been turned to the corresponding articles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second half of these two articles are devoted to the fingering skills of Victor playing the piano. One of the characteristics of this new instrument is that The praiseworthy improvement, the one feels that this is contrary to the classic fingerings that many great musicians and famous musicians have gradually formed through countless performances. It is a betrayal of tradition and music. The so-called improvement does not know why it is improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the meaning of Pietro’s words, but Lucien still doesn’t understand why he reacts so intensely. Isn’t it that those gentlemen will go to quarrel? Question? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really understand the art of playing the harpsichord?" Pierou asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Piano, harpsichord..." Lucien heard this and suddenly remembered that Pieiro knew that he was introducing himself after learning the piano. the book had a "harpsichord playing art", then this book carefully transferred from the library soul out, carefully looked at the cover: "author:? San Antonio Duo" <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Piedru, is Mr. Antonio Mulberry?" Lucian asked somewhat clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piyru groaned, then proudly said: "He is my father, a great harpsichord, I can’t stand your destruction. His art."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn't want to argue with him about these things, his right hand pressed down: "The standard of good or bad is the expressive power of music. Let time prove it. Well, Piyru, I will leave the library today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still wanted to say something, but when I saw Pieru’s firm and reluctant attitude, Lucien gave up and turned away. This kind of thing can’t be persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I would be friends with Pierou." Lucien sighed when she left the music library, not every good person she met. Being able to be your own friend, more than just a short intersection, is gradually drifting away for various reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the concert ended successfully yesterday, Victor announced that later learning will return to Normal weekdays until Friday, and after so busy, no matter whether Victor, Lot, Felice, Herodotus need to relax, plus today is a week, need to go to church to pray, so four The piano room in the building was empty, and Lucien, who was looking for a visit to Felice, could not find anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe in the afternoon, I should go to Felice to find her in the home of the noble area..." Lu Xien put the purse in the room and seriously considered the door to find Fei Li Silk things, with excuses and reasons, urgency is normal, "but how to convince her? Take Jintal, or other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trouble this One thing, Lucien returned to the lobby on the first floor and asked Elena whether there was a garden villa for rent in Jisu District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house rental is usually asked and handled in the town hall or adventurer guild, but the Jisu area is mainly musicians, performers, musicians, so The rental of houses in this area is coordinated by the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the introduction and analysis of Elena's hard work, Lucien looked at the second floor garden villa of No. 116 in Jisu District, which belongs to a common music. Home, due to the invitation of a Viscount of the Kingdom of Syracuse to serve as a music consultant, and to rent a house commissioned association, the location is relatively remote, the rent is a Jintale every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be prepared to go to the field and look at the villa, Lucien, see it is already ten o'clock, decided to leave the association, go back and continue to deal with the hidden in the cabin Things, when I went to find Fries in the afternoon, I passed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, goodbye." Elena smiled, and Casey bent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just returned to the Adejan district, Lucien noticed Alice’s house surrounded a lot of neighbors, just as John whispered as he was the official knight attendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the morning prayers, these poor people who have been busy from morning to night have a rare daytime rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien’s mental strength increased, his ears seemed to become sharper. At the door of his hut, they heard vaguely saying “Joel”. "Invitation", "moving away"... and other words, the heart slammed, raised an inexplicable, bad premonition, so he turned and walked outside the home of Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Roy, what are you talking about?" Lucien asked a neighbor who knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Roy’s neighbor is working hard all the year round, and the 30-year-old man is obviously old. He still doesn’t know that Lucien is a princess music consultant. The thing, smiles and said: "Lu Xien, Joel, he was finally lucky. Before he was praying, he was invited by a nobleman to go to his territory as a family musician. He watched him smile and rushed. Alyssa and Ai Wen’s way of collecting gifts, the rewards must be very rich.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Lucien, it is said that because you are famous, become music Home, so the aristocratic master felt that Joel, who taught you music from an early age, was very talented and invited him to be a family musician. "Another neighbor, Liz's middle-aged grandmother, looked at Lucien. "Is this true?" Are you really a musician? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing! "Lu Xien smelled a strange smell, and quickly asked, "Which nobleman invited Uncle Joel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there are really nobles who invite Joel because they are famous and become princess's music consultants, they will not go so hurried, even if they don't have time to inform John, who is out of town in the morning, must also tell himself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not like Joel’s acting style, nor the purpose of the nobility, if Not telling himself, what benefits does he invite Joel?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
