			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" Lanhill repeated Verragund’s question, blocking his body in the hole, blocking the sun, making it dark and gloomy, then Smiled, "Of course it is the bloody plain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand stunned: "Is you collusion with bloody king? You made the elf tree polluted Why do you want to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is increasingly feeling his own dangerous situation, taking all opportunities to delay the time, trying to get rid of the influence of the devil projection, but he hates The emotions have accumulated over hundreds of years. Learning "the dance of revenge" is not a short-term behavior. The "seed" has long been ingrained and cannot be dissolved for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill seems to have not noticed Ferragand’s attempt, and laughs very well: “Blood King? He’s a 'schizophrenic’ patient, What qualifications work with me? As for the pollution of the Elf Tree, it is actually thanks to you and your natural hate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gyrolysis" is used by Lucien To describe the vocabulary of a mental illness, because it is very close to the condition of some double-headed, three-headed, and four-headed demons, it is often used by adventurers near the abyss gap, and the elves are no strangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Ferragad asked in cooperation, but did not think that the pollution of the Elf tree was really related to himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill’s performance at this time is like the big villain in the bard story. At the moment of success, he always proudly shows off his plans. Because of the many words, I left the opportunity for a turnaround: "The Heart of Nature is an item close to the gods. Even if I secretly separate a trace of breath into the abyss, it is difficult to pollute it unless the abyss will Seriously injured and awakened in sleep, but the original elves were born out of the heart of nature, and every elf flows through the natural blood, which is related to the blood of the elves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In this case, when enough elves are projected by the ancient devil, degraded and demonized, and our symmetrical magic array arranged in the Scarlet Plain, the elf tree naturally becomes contaminated accordingly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking here, Lanhill snorted: "It is a very complicated thing to let the admiring nature's elves be entangled in negative emotions for a long time, but your nature. The hate faction has solved our difficulties, they There is a very hostile to human beings. Everything that includes human beings, including normal activities, is regarded as a reason for hatred. The negative emotions are blinded by their own rationality, which perfectly conforms to the preconditions of the summoning and demon ghost projection. Therefore, I have to thank you. Ferragad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand’s imaginary heart of nature has a face that resembles him, but this face Full of negative emotions of hatred, resentment, and hatred, the face of "he" is distorted, ugly and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this me?" Ferragand saw this face when he eliminated the influence of the ancient devil, although he understood that this was his inner negative emotion by the devil. After the projection, I can't help but be shocked. When I usually mention natural hatred, is this also the performance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the mood, suppresses the anger caused by Lanhill’s words, and is incomprehensible: "Why can only a small part of the demonized devil be naturally Hate faction?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The elf that is really projected by the demon ghost, unless he is willing to reach a certain limit, there will be no external magical performance. Only the elves who struggled and hesitated and resisted the hateful emotions could not control themselves and show signs of degeneration. The difference between the two is like Martha and you.” Lan Hill “due diligence” Explain the reason for Ferragad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the last half of the sentence, Ferragad’s inner anger once again surged: "The original Martha had been projected by the devil ghost and became yours." Underneath, no wonder she will filthy me, but why do you have to deal with me? What purpose do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reason for dealing with you? My The goal has always been you? Don't let you fall and demonize, become the legendary level of the devil's ghost body, how can I go further?" Lan Hill said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Your goal has always been me?" Ferragad couldn’t believe that he and Lanhill were not very harmonious, but they did not The degree of assassination of each other, then he suddenly realized, "Let the Magic Council aid be what you asked for? In order to let them investigate me, then use my hatred of humanity, filthy anger, ignite my negative emotions, plus The influence of the long-term 'vengeance dance' makes the devil successfully project into my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" When he heard this, Ferragad's anger hated it and almost went to the attack. "You are not afraid of the magicians investigating the real mastermind?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the magical array in the bloody plains, in addition to the contradictions of the power of the abyss and the material world, can also lure Lucien? Evans they investigated in the past, and they went to the abyss Austria must also follow, otherwise there is no way to confess to the Magic Council, and in this way, I can act without scruple, and when they find the 'evidence' from the Scarlet Plain, the 'witness' and the 'mastermind' are dead. Escape, his astrology is strong, and there is no way to predict it!" Lan Hill said, raising his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't worry about Lucien? Evans refuses to go to the abyss? And Atlante?" Ferragad will "devil projection" Slightly ruled out a bit, suddenly a spirit of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill raised his hands and pointed the short bow to Ferragand, smiling: "If he doesn't go, he is not studying quantum superposition and proposing observations." Lucien Evans of the effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because of the low strength, Lucien always analyzed other people’s surnames and acting styles. Make plans, but now, others are analyzing him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Atlant, he is happy with my plan. He wants to wait for a safer and more reliable road, dare not try, but It doesn't mean that he doesn't want to borrow information from this time. For some reason, I know his position, so I secretly secretly sent him to him and asked him to apply for the investigation. Lanhill laughed at Ferragad. How can his magician who studies the mind know that there is no abnormality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand hated the earth: "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our elves have been quiet for too long, and for a long time they have forgotten the glory of the past, I am not willing to be trapped in this small forest forever, I imagine the ancestors Conquer the continent, conquer the ocean, conquer the whole world, and revitalize the glory of the elves!” Lanhill’s elegant face is slightly mad. “And all this needs to be based on the power of the god-like level! I have a chance now. Going in this direction, so must catch, Ferragad, I will remember 'Contribution' for the elves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand glared at Lanhill: "You!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too shameful to hate it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill looked at the sun outside, haha ​​smiled: "Ferragand, don't be angry, you know why I want to tell you so much? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Ferragand to answer, he stepped forward and jokingly said: "In order to keep your hatred, anger, pain, waiting for the opportunity Arrival!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Sien? Evans They should have arrived at the altar, where there is a source of natural pollution, but the bloody king 'failed' When he escapes, he will deliberately touch the magic array, so that Malfurion has to use his natural magic to remedy. Unfortunately, he does not know that the more he works, the better it is for me, 'the nature of the abyss and negative emotions', 'The legend of the fall of nature and the forest', the two will form a huge ceremony to help me transform the perfect state!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions in negative emotions Of course, it was assumed by Ferragad this "container"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the bloody king will leave some clues to let Malfurion and Lucien Evans also investigate that the mastermind is you!" Seeing the time is almost over, the face is filled with joy and serious mixed feelings, "Ferragand, don't try to resist, you have no chance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fira Gund's teeth bite his lips, blood flowing out, his eyes staring at Lan Hill, red and cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody king’s head and the head of the goat only felt that everything around it became gray, the blood faded in color, the raindrops were frozen in the air, and the earth remained in an ups and downs. Like the most perfect sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All swearing and killing are gone, all blood and stench subsides, and the world becomes quiet and fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
