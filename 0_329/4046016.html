			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of garbage that was cleaned up and was not suitable for throwing into the sewer. Lucien came back and forth seven or eight times, making it dirty. They all moved to the four-wheeled cart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, every morning, the hard work of the church hires the garbage in the city and transports it to the outside of the city, so that the city is dirty and the disease is transmitted, but the Musicians Association I don't want to wait until the next morning, such a large pile of garbage is really unsightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When picking up the last pile of rubbish, Lucien walked into the hall carefully and without any noise, walking around the edge of the rotunda and toward the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf, damn, can't you let me watch the score for a while?" The mellow but somewhat sharp voice suddenly sounded, and at the same time The figure in the red jacket rushed down the stairs, and as he walked down, he turned back and cursed, just hitting the dodgeless Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking, there is something in the rubbish held by Lucien that falls on the carpet, even if the carpet is thick and soft, it still can’t stop it. Slightly dull voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure in the red jacket swayed a few times before standing still, it was the musician Victor who went up before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor took a deep breath, then bent over and smashed the broken oil lamp and handed it to the other hand that was still in a hurry and steady Ruby of the road: "Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stairs went down again. A brown-haired middle-aged man in a dark blue long coat, his chin has an obvious The arc that is tilted forward: "Victor, the association is not just for you, I have the right to do what I want to do, and I want to go back to my home as I want."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is doing a gesture of strengthening his tone, his face is a concealed smile: "It’s only been more than three months since your first symphony in the Hall of the Holy Grail, your nervousness and sensitivity. I understand very well, but you are not even ready for the music? I have been looking forward to it for a long time, even after I have finished listening to it, I will write an article for you in "Music Review"."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you have the ability to hold your own concert in the Hall of the Holy Grail. Victor cursed one, turned and left the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf's face became very poor, and while he was low, he returned to the upper floor: "If you didn't have you, more than three months later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sees the quarrel stop, he continues to carry the garbage and walks outside the gate. Suddenly, his eyes are swept away and he sees that there is no glass on the top. The oil lamp, I saw the beautiful pattern of the carving was worn a lot of lamp holders, my heart fretting: "This seems to be metal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an idea After Lucien put the last pile of garbage on the four-wheeled cart, he reached out and touched the lamp holder and found that it was really a metal product. It seemed to be copper, but it was harder than the copper that Lucien had seen in his life. And more flexible: "Is it similar to copper? Although there is not much metal in this lamp holder, if you sell it to a blacksmith, you should still be able to sell a few copper fairs."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Money?" As a true poor man, Lucien now thinks of anything worthwhile, no matter what he sees, the idea is Open, "Maybe there is something good in this garbage? For example, waste paper, bad feather pen, etc. just seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is like discovering A "treasure", the heart is full of surprises, although it is so insignificant for the rich, but it is the first light on the road to the road to change his life, as long as he can save five silver Nar, you can master the text in a month, no matter how you learn to learn magic, you can understand the state of the world by knowing the words, and you have other worlds of knowledge, experience, and a library of books. You can find another, better way to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excited, awkward, yearning for a better future, let Lucien be full of strength, pushing a four-wheeler and going outside the city, but at the same time worrying about it. From the garbage dump to find out what can be used, what to sell, and there is no technical content, can only block the normal people's rejection of dirty items, as well as fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the gang does not intervene on this, other scattered shackles, I can handle it." After the battle with Gary and Correa, they are fighting red eyes in the sewers Rats, Lucien is still a bit confident about his strength. Although his strength is not as good as that of adults who have been exercising for a long time, it is also an important factor to win when he is fighting, not panic, calm, and accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After self-reporting that the bard was a reason for the musician association, Lucien quickly left the matter behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city gate area, Andrei had a little impression of Lucien, and saw the garbage of a car, immediately understood what task he took, so He smiled at him, did not come up to entangle, let Lu Xien pass the carelessness of the goalkeeper soldiers, out of the city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no one to follow me, isn’t the gang really intervening?" Lucien thought strangely and excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien did not relax, and went out of the city gate. After walking for more than 20 minutes on the lower reaches of the Belém River, he saw that it was quiet. Then, the four-wheeled vehicle was pushed into the grass on the side of the road, and he was looking for something that might sell money in the garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken oil lamp, a few pieces of rusty metal, eight broken feather pens, a lot of waste paper into a group, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien turned to the end and pulled out a square, transparent, black veil with a hint of scent and a distinct hole in it. It’s like a hook: “It looks like a veil, maybe a female surnamed musician.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this veil and rub it The texture, Lucien has no radiant association at all, only the judgment of its worthless value: "It should be a good black yarn, but what can I do? Well, you can sell it to the tailor and cut the black yarn into Small decorations such as skirts and coats, laces, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things that will be found, wrapped in a few pieces of waste paper, hidden in the vicinity, the road Sean continued to push the four-wheeler to the garbage dump downstream of the Belé River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten minutes, Lucien went to the Belém River and saw the piles of hill-like rubbish, but let Lucien be surprised by the rubbish Not as much as I imagined, and the place where the rubbish is piled up is still some distance away from the clear water like the emerald river. It can't be washed away by the river: "Is it concentrated and treated with magic?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very quiet place around. Lucien didn't see a half-personal shadow. Only the stench came: "Nobody else is here to find the valuable things in the garbage? Could it be afraid of the plague? Or is it not this habit?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the reason, seeing this pile of stinky garbage, Lucien is like seeing a pile of money, After disposing of your own garbage, I couldn't help but walk around here, completely ignoring the stench. Compared with the plague that has not yet been traced, the empty purse can make Lucien take a certain risk, let alone The world is also treated with magic and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien is also afraid of what kind of disease is infected. When looking for garbage, he is holding his hands with waste paper, very careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high society organization, the Musicians’ Association has more valuable things in the garbage than others, but Lucien still found a lot of energy here. Something that sells money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering passing through the city gate, afraid of causing suspicion from others, plus for the first time, Lucien is a bit embarrassed, so just took a bad After the small half of the bag, the rest was transferred to a nearby shelter to bury it, and then the four-wheeled vehicle was pushed back, and then the first oil lamp wrapped in paper was placed in the bag and stacked on the four-wheeler. And try to level it out so that it looks like it's on a four-wheeler to avoid the dirt of the four-wheeler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the veil can be hidden on the body, Lucien is of course placed in his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When crossing the gate, the guard soldiers still just looked at them casually, and waved to let Lucien go in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the four wheels to the side of Andre and Mag, seeing them rushing to cover their noses, Lucian sneaked a sneak: "I It’s Lucien, I’ll come to the musicians’ association for the reward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mag went out to the side and cursed, and poured out the copper fee Er: "Damn, take your money and roll, take this dirty, stinking stroller!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ander The squad stood farther and had a habitual smile on his face: "It seems that you are sending garbage to the Belém River for the first time. It took so much time to go back and forth. Hey, if it is delayed, it is not impossible to enter. The problem with the city, there are water ghosts in the middle of the night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
