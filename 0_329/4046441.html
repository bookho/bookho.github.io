			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is light, and when he hears Nesika, Milina and others, it is like a blue sky, and it’s awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who study mathematics knowledge and get the prize of the Arcane Scepter, there is always a feeling of pride in mathematics, but in practice, mathematics is only The tools of arcane exploration and spell analysis are their vassals. Not many arcans are willing to devote their life to this field full of unparalleled beauty. For most arcanes, it is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner tower of the towers likes the mathematicians in the field of mathematics, more or less have the same meaning as the words of Lucien, but this is only occasional Self-proclaimed, occasional flash of light, occasional casual complaints, no one like Lucien? In this way, Evans used such an impactful argument to tell the side of mathematics that is higher than the intuitive understanding and higher than the actual experience, and lifted the important surname of mathematics to something they never expected. status. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are well aware that Lucien is a correct weight in the Levsky paper, it does not prevent them from being excited, and the long-lost blood is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky is more excited and trembling, yes, mathematics does not deceive me, so there is "rigorous proof of geometric principles and parallel line theorem" In the sea where there seems to be no marginality, in this sea where the storm never stops, it is precisely grasping mathematics, relying on it wholeheartedly, not being "deceived" by the outside world, and being able to survive the ups and downs. , through the vast sea, not to be overwhelmed by the wind and waves, not to be sunk by despair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando still did not praise his students, just nodded gently, the deeper meaning of this statement is more worth exploring than the surface content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retracted his right hand, folded the papers around the conference room, and put another one in the magic array just taken out of the storage bag. Stacked thick papers, gentle smile: "Next, let us try to start from another road to see if we can use unusual scenery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are mathematical models, and there is proof that Levski geometry is compatible with the geometry of the tower. Although members of Mirina and others are still extremely resistant, after all, no one likes to deny themselves, admits that they made mistakes, and is wrong for more than ten years. However, I have to initially agree with this new geometry system. At this point, in order to overthrow Levski geometry, it is necessary to overthrow the high tower geometry compatible with it, which is completely contrary to their original intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus the words of Lucian hit the mind, they are complex but relatively stable at this time, without looking at the papers with any prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Another hypothesis about the parallel line theorem"?" Hair swelled, and the graceful Mirina whispered the subject, faintly guessing what . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another hypothesis..." Levsky seems to feel that the fog has been dispelled and he has seen the problems he has neglected for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is like attending a class at a magic school, projecting his hand to the paper, and letting the content line up: "Mr. Levsky is assuming a straight line. Outside, at least two lines can be drawn parallel to the known line, and then together with the original axioms and public works, a new geometric system that is logically rigorous and self-consistent is derived. Then we do not make another hypothesis? Another hypothesis of the complete set of Levski geometry and tower geometry: 'A point beyond the straight line, no line is parallel to the known line'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, let's perform deductive reasoning and see what happens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levski breathed a little, his emotions excited again, and seemed to understand What, and Nesika, Milina and other members dignifiedly look at the papers projected by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One page of the paper has been turned over, and a paragraph is given. Because of the authority of the field of mathematics, Lucien explains very quickly, many places They are all briefly taken, but Nesika and other people’s faces are getting more and more serious, and they are more and more confused. When I don’t know, Marpel blurted out and whispered: “It’s really different from Levs. The basic geometry but equally bizarre proposition..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on..." Her voice triggered a response from Salgueiro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a new geometric system that is essentially different from the geometry of the tower?" Milina was at a loss, just a few hours ago, she It is still firmly believed that it is impossible to have a new geometric system that is essentially different from the geometry of the tower. In less than a day, this view seems to have been ruthlessly shattered and crushed twice in succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky is not confused, but is deeply meditation. Why is this happening? Why do we get different geometric systems that are complete, read, and logically rigorously self-consistent from the different negatives of the fifth public offering and the fifth public offering itself? Why is this? Is this related to the real world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of Lord Douglas, the arcane masters who grew up in the Magic Council inevitably like to ask why, but there are so few like Lucien. less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat..." Fernando gently beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time flies, Lucian’s paper goes to the last part, using a spherical-like model to prove the surreal last name of the previous content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesika deeply sighed: "Sure enough, it is a new geometric system, Evans geometry."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mathematics really doesn't lie..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of arrogance and prejudice, they missed a name that used their own surname to name the entire geometry. The opportunity, if you can accept Levsky's hypothesis, then Lun? This assumption of Evans is easy to think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not end, but showed the last pages of the paper: "I defined the concept of curvature in the paper, from the calculation can be drawn When the curvature is zero, it is the tower geometry. When the curvature is less than zero, it is Mr. Levsky's new geometry. When the curvature is greater than zero, it is the geometry I just talked about. They have essentially Common places are compatible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirina sighed softly and now seems to be easier to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky suddenly realized that he was just applauding with excitement, and he saw Lucien pressing his hand and indicating that everyone was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else does he want to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same question appeared in the hearts of different members and appeared in Levsky’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is no longer as aggressive and aggressive as he used to be, but the voice is very light and soft:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can see that under certain circumstances, the mathematical knowledge we studied is beyond our experience and intuitive experience, which makes us subject to many constraints, making the development of mathematical sciences like being tied. The eagle with its wings can only go forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we can try to strip the mathematical knowledge from reality, temporarily not considering their physical models and The practical significance, starting from the most primitive, fundamental and simple concepts and axioms, through the reasoning and deduction, develops a rigorous and self-consistent mathematical system. As for what role this system has, what it stands for, it will wait for the specific arcane exploration. Because you need this system when you encounter new problems, consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my personal opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien simply mentioned the axiom Concept, but did not discuss in depth, or wait arcanist have slowly come to accept this concept, this talent has come to think of consciousness development too late, everything step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the sparse applause sounded from Levski, he felt that he and the Evans committee had too many common languages, he said every In one sentence, he is faintly aware of what he can't express, and at the same time, his understanding, support, and proof of his new geometric system is no less than saving his life, and his vibrating speech makes him present. It is also very exciting to think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one's applause, Nesika's face changed again and again, and all the previous words came to mind, finally hesitating to raise his hand and gently applaud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the response of the first person, Milina, Marper, Salgueiro and others followed the applause and gradually became hesitant and resisted. Sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, is there any objection to the Evans committee's high evaluation of Levsky's thesis?" Fernando asked after the applause stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesicala took off his own long white eyebrows and stood up suddenly, watching Levsky say: "Please accept my apology, this is one A essay that was enough to win the Arcane Scepter Award, my arrogance and prejudice made me unable to accept the new geometry. I fully agree with the results of the Evans committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
