			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-masted sailboat is quiet and stunned, like a monster hidden in the night, two boat boats just parked next to it, there are two rope ladders Sliding down, just in front of the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom turned his head and whispered to the teenagers: "Don't talk, don't make big moves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;With his request, the atmosphere suddenly became depressed. Sprint, who had been laughing and relaxing, their faces were dignified. It seems that it is clear at this time that they are not happy to travel, but are preparing to hide and break through. The blockade of the church will be tied to the cross with a little carelessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that they all understand the seriousness of the matter, Tom whispered to Lucien: "Evans, I will go up and check, after confirming that there is no problem, you Arrange the children to climb the rope ladder. It’s hard for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nothing.” Lucien doesn’t mind, if he is a formal magician at this time, Asking the first one to go up, the young people behind are not arranged and supervised, it is easy to get confused, causing the attention of other people in the sailboat, but it hurts themselves. So sometimes, everyone is really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-level knight Tom gently pulls the rope ladder, and the whole person climbs up like a black afterimage, turns over the boat and disappears into the deck corner. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suppresses tension, even if the younger Sprint is so proud, his face is dignified, can't say a word, quietly waiting for Tom's signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Tom put his head out of the boat. Because Lucien didn’t tell him that he had dark vision, he was throwing down the agreed white handkerchief. It means that everything is normal and you can climb the rope ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sprint, Katrina, you climb one side." Lucien arranged without hesitation, calm attitude made a little nervous The teenagers seem to have found a source of dependence and confidence, slowly calm down, and are able to enter the spell-casting focus without shaking their hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One teenager, along with Lucine’s methodical command, did not make a big move to the deck, hidden under Tom’s instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ormos, Heidi, it’s up to you." When I arranged for Olmos, Lucien discovered that the spirit was good. The brown-haired boy has a low sense of existence. He learns quietly every day, exercises quietly, eats quietly, and returns to the room quietly, as if he were the shadow of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ormos nodded, stretched his hand, grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up, very fast and very balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There seems to be the strength of the Cavaliers..." Lucien said in a meaningful way that Heidi was awkward compared to him. The swaying, windy rope ladder scared her face white and her movements were stiff. She couldn't help but scream if it wasn't Mr. Evans' authority and "fear" deep into her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and didn't help Heidi unless she had signs of falling. Such experiences are a valuable asset for growth for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In slowness, pain, and fear, Heidi finally turned over to the deck, only to feel soft, weak hands and feet, and can carefully recall the experience just now, she is again Full of pride, I actually climbed the horrible rope ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to her, Lei Yi Liya also climbed to the first level to stop, very difficult to get to the deck, while the departure of Annick has long been in accordance with Tom's Commanded to hide in the shadow of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All apprentices have succeeded, Lucien has no delay, left hand carrying his black suitcase, right hand holding the rope ladder, a few times to land silent Standing on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom greeted a sailor with dark skin and curly hair: "Oh, Evans, you seem to have the strength of a high-ranking knight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a knight sword." Lucien did not respond positively, then under the leadership of Tom and the sailor, from the back of the deck to the cabin Go to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two layers, the smoky, damp, sweaty smell came in, the darkness in the aisle, all by the sailor holding the candlestick to illuminate the progress the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly solidified, and dangerous emotions hit every apprentice. When Lucien was inspected by the ship's magical array to detect magical fluctuations and prepared to display "magic humanity," the two sailors nodded at Tom at the same time. : "Head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom replied in a low voice: "No problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, everything is fine." Two sailors let the road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seem to feel the doubts of Lucien and others, Tom turned back, a smile on the gloomy face: "I am the sailor of this ship." Or how could it be so easy to sneak in? The merchant ship of Viscount Wright is equipped with a lot of divine arrays and preached by the pastor. Moreover, even if I sneak in, there is no sailor who helped me prepare food and fruit for nearly a month. On the voyage, you will all starve to death and die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm strait is called the strait, and it is not wide, but because of the lightning thunder and the violent winds, It takes a short time to get through and stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that many powerful magicians have explored why there are so many and so concentrated lightning and hurricanes in this strait, but in the end there is no conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "freshly baked" sailor Tom, Lucien associates with the deep friendship between Granny and the Viscount Wright, a faint feeling, Viscount Wright The fleet is afraid of being infiltrated very much, especially Granny as one of the maintainers of the underground order of Sturk, and most of the sailors, coolies, etc. should be controlled by him. Didn’t the Viscount Wright as a great knight know a little? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Tom’s leadership, Lucien and others quickly arrived at the penultimate floor of the cargo storage, which was dark, damp, dull, dirty and full. A variety of odors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in a hidden corner, there is a row of cabins, they are very narrow, it seems that they are not originally inhabited, but now they have been cleaned up, hanging Got a hammock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two apprentices, Mr. Evans himself." Tom arranged, and finally, "You can't go out of this layer during this time." The cabin can only be meditation and cannot cast magic, and even when this activity is carried out, it is necessary to pay attention to the situation of people checking the goods. When Holm is concerned, the suffering will be rewarded."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take away Tom, the apprentices returned to the room with a candlestick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliya and Heidi, after pushing the door open, the two people laughed and laughed, then passed behind and prepared to go to their room. Nick Road: "Annick, on the boat, you don't have to practice the magical cast. It feels so easy. I think I am going to swear that the scorpion is dumb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You can sleep late!" Heidi felt that the dirty and unpleasant cabin did not seem so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But still can't forget to simulate the practice, magic is our root, the more skilled it is, the more useful it is." Annick said so, his face still Can't help but reveal a relaxed expression, holiday is the favorite thing for every child! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Familiar, gentle, and always a little fear of their hearts rang behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliyah and Heidi stood up in good order, hands clasped, and their heads lowered: "Mr. Evans." The smile on his face still can't cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently nodded: "Since you can't practice magic, then we continue to learn the basics of arcane and magic in the afternoon, identify the type of 'magic creature', and then Do another set of exercises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?!" The faces of the three children were completely smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Although the time and practice of learning increased, but Lucien still intends to give them enough rest and relaxation time, can plan very It was interrupted soon. When the sailboat returned to the dock to set off with the caravan and entered the turbulent stormy strait, Lei Yi Li Ya and Heidi began to seasick, and they were so weak that they could not think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such apprentices account for the vast majority, even the proud Sprint and Katrina are hard to escape, except for the expected Olmos In addition, only Annick, the seemingly thin and small apprentice, was not affected. If Tom’s non-Tom sent food and fruit hoarseness was also responsible for removing the vomit of the apprentices, this layer could not live alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
