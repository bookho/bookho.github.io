			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucine calmly transcribed a sentence, the white letterhead suddenly jumped out of a bloody red word, like a rogue blood, giving a horror Feeling:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop what you do! Otherwise you will receive a corpse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Low, the panicked Lucien dropped the feather pen on the table, with a little stuttering: "I just want to record your request, so as not to forget."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your excuse is funny, Mr. Evans, stop these stupid moves, this is your last chance, if you do something like this, you will receive Joel’s body, of course, a finger warning is a must!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is suffering, self-blaming, but does not let these emotions affect themselves, Beginning with the decision to not cooperate with the cultists and seek to save people, Lucien may be affected by Uncle Joel, Eliza and Evan. Victims have a mental preparation, to save people from the hands of the kidnappers is not a dinner party, not the party, not romantic, not to pay the cost of consciousness, it is certainly not a success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everything is as you wish, I will behave well." Lucien shredded the white paper that transcribed the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He can see me, relying on this magical item stationery, or is there another means? Next, try this, but not too urgent, so as not to be seen "The problem is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the stationery was quiet, Lucien put it away, and pretended to be lying on the bed a little bit, and the mental power did not spread. Going out, just relying on a fuzzy sensor to judge whether there are any other supernatural forces in the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you can't use magic to explore, it is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows very well that by now, he is able to test something, not how much he is smarter than the cultists, but from the fact that they don’t know The information at the bottom of the information is asymmetrical, and this advantage is a little impatient and slightly negligent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire cottage, except for the envelopes in the box, has no supernatural power and induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seemingly calm at noon, Lucien took his own cognac A lot of money bags, went to Jisu District and found the old garden villa at No. 116. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better than Lucien’s imagination, in the vicinity of the city wall in the Jisu district, because there is no gate, so it’s very deserted, only a few on both sides of the road. The two-storey villas, which seem to be poorly repaired, are spaced far apart in the shelter of the street trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of street tree resembling paulownia called Lava, tall and thick, with dense foliage, completely surrounded by these two-storey villas, with golden leaves and wind Fluttering, full of poetry, and set off a quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for the nearby environment, Lucien, walked to the front door of the iron railing, slammed it, the association was responsible for housing rental in Jisu District. The personnel should have arrived in accordance with the morning agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, when I heard the knock on the door, I walked out of a white two-story building covered with ivy, a man in his thirties, who kept The manicured beard, dressed in a brown formal suit, looks savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Evans, I am Brian, I will take you around the villa." I have already been on Music Review and Symphony. The guide's headline and oil portrait of Lucien is the most heated person in the association today, so Brian, who once went to the library to borrow books, recognized Lucien at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he opened the iron gate and saw Lucien first reach out his right hand, he quickly greeted him with both hands and shook it with the right hand of Lucien. The attitude is very respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to take charge of housing rentals in the status of civilians in the most rewarding and self-serving department of the association, Brian relies on his own savvy and careful For Lu Xien, a promising musician, how could he be stupid enough to show arrogant attitudes? After all, there is no interest dispute between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately, due to the walls and the overgrown Lava trees, the lighting of the whole building is very bad, so the refreshing and bright style is under the dim, creating a strange sensation, with the outside of the vine External phase lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, the villa is very quiet and does not have strong sunlight. It is a place for music creation. I don't know if you are satisfied. Braun tried to make the shortcomings an advantage. It was because the musicians were entrusted to the association after the light was poor, and they could not be rented for several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t mind the darkness, because it meant that the night was definitely darker, so he nodded: “You show me the rental contract.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Braun forcibly held back his smile and took a thick stack of rental contracts from the carrying bag to Lucien, as long as he could When the villa is rented out, in addition to the rewards that should be received, the servants who cleaned up and kept clean in the past few months are also employed by him. The difference in the middle naturally belongs to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the contract without any problems and picked up Brian’s feather pen to sign his name and took out a Jintal from the purse. To the other party, as an acclaimed musician, renting a house in Jisu District does not have a deposit and a three-month prepayment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian wrote the receipt in a good manner, put away the contract, and then smiled and asked: "Mr. Evans, at least one such villa needs at least one Butler, four maids, a cook, a gardener, a carriage, and a coachman, I can help you find someone from your own guild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I may take a while to move in completely. You will come over and pick me up next week." Lucien thought about it and agreed to Brian's proposal, but delayed the time by a week because this is The most critical time period for saving the hostages, you must not have any negligence or interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing the key to Lucien, Brian walked briskly, and Lucien stood quietly in the less dark hall at noon. Stairs to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor has a total of four bedrooms, a study, a piano room, a small terrace; the first floor is the lobby, restaurant and four maids A room, a storage room, a basement; the kitchen is a (read-force) cabin with a small door to the left of the villa, and a complete villa sewer connected to the Alto developed sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The villa that can live in such a large area and is so well decorated, it should be full of joy for Lucien, who is struggling to enjoy life. Now Lu Xien looks at it all, only suppressing the irritability and anger inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing for a while, Lucien rushed back to his own cabin in the Adejan district and then deliberately brought a few pieces of clothing back to the garden villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the clothes in the master bedroom on the second floor, Lucien walks into the quietest piano room of the entire villa, its walls are the same as the Victor’s piano room It is made of special stone material, which can block the sound in the room, which will not only disturb the other people but also the perfect echo effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed the door of the piano room, there was a kind of silence and tranquility in the whole room. Except for Lucien’s own footsteps, I could not hear any movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains are also pulled up, Lucian sat on the lounge chair of the piano room, slowly shaking in the darkness, focusing on the spirit but not venting Around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no stationery items made by the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How would he observe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extreme silence, Lucy It’s like sleeping and not sleeping, as if the whole room is in the fuzzy sense of your own soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a wave of supernatural powers is generated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not open his eyes, his ears heard a slight sigh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it with 'Alto Tiger Mosquito'? Is it a detective deity, or is it simply a metamorphosis?" Like asleep, Lucien quietly judged, though, what means for the cultists It is still unclear, but the purpose of this temptation has been reached: in the case of stationery, the other party relies on it, it is both a contact tool and a surveillance item, and as long as it is far from the envelope, the other party must use other magical techniques. Observe and track yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
