			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "When I wrote this paper on general relativity, I got real-world feedback and generated 'time directly in the soul. Stop the 'magic of this time and space class.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of time and space belongs to the intersection of the five major factions of astrology, force field, change, electromagnetic and light darkness, so it is extremely complicated. It is not a magician who is proficient in these five factions. It can only be constructed by mathematical foundation and mental strength. It is much more difficult than learning the same level of magic. Lucien’s original plan to promote the 9th Ring is to build a "skill sequencer" and "pull". Wendi's Flame Hell, "Meteor Blast" and other artisans who are good at faction, but who knows that the "time stop" in the nine-ring magic and "big cracking" is so quietly generated by itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real-world feedback..." Fernando became a little bit amazed and became dignified. This feedback is common to every Arcanist and is repeatable. Verified, but that's it, they are eager to figure out how it works, understand why feedback, and how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Arcanist, writing a thesis is a final process, accompanied by confidence in the outcome, just like getting an experiment As a result, I improved my magic, and I thought about it for a long time. The things that solved a lot of problems were finalized in such a process, and I had my own spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the draft and thinking will lead to changes in the cognitive world, then the wrong ideas and omissions in the early stage will cause great danger, it is likely An arcane master just had a good idea, a good idea, and the cognitive world changed. He could figure out the problem in the next second and slammed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the unsolved mystery that this magical parliament has been valued for more than a hundred years, Fernando asked a few more questions and found that it was not much different from the original. I temporarily pressed the question and said: "Since you have promoted the Nine Rings, the legendary item reward of general relativity is replaced by the 'magic source' ceremony. You stay in Aringe these two days, you can't go anywhere, who? It can't be said that to concentrate on the strength of magic, and when Douglas comes out from the semi-position, we jointly determine the value of your paper, and secretly help you to hold a legendary advanced ceremony with the aid of the 'magic source' ritual."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the cognitive world semi-cured ** division, the legendary advanced ceremony is a parliamentary package, completely free, and the kind of magical ritual to help the cognitive world For semi-cured ** divisions, not only the additional auxiliary rituals need to prepare their own materials and pay for the legendary magician, but even the legendary advanced ceremony has to bear half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very realistic but also very equal. No one is angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, will this leave any hidden dangers?" Lucien is of course willing to be promoted to legend in advance, which means that his safety is truly guaranteed. Otherwise, even if there are two legendary items in the body, using one or two legendary magic will be exhausted, and it doesn't make much sense. But if the hidden danger is too big, Lucien is not impatient in Allinge and Lenta. A special house for ten years - Natasha can pick up the sword of truth when he is at level 8, but he can only use two or three swords in use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s smile: “This expensive ritual requires six legendary magicians to assist, and there is a big hidden danger. Well, the failure rate is relatively high. High, but this time I will invite Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, Oliver, Helen and me to host, four legendary peaks plus two legendary third-order arcanists, can greatly reduce the failure rate, which is magic The most luxurious lineup of this ritual has been held in history, and the foundation of your own strength is not stable. After the promotion of the legend, it should take more time to advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you have your own unique meditation? In this way, after you have slowly and slowly upgraded to the second level of the legend, the foundation is almost solid. Of course, even if it is slow, it is relative to other arcanists. Both Douglas and Brooke have soared to their peaks for decades, far faster than the legendary career-matched wizards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not need to be weighed, the road Sean nodded: "The general phase When the audit results come out, I will redeem the 'Magic Origin' ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Magic Council, except for the seven Arcanes, the rest of the legendary magicians are Below the legendary third order, the prophet, the cursed eye, the master of deformation, and the master of alchemy are the second-order legend. The creator, the silver moon scholar, the absolute defense, the monarch of the air, the sun king and the starlight are the first order, of which three The power of Xingyao, which was promoted ten years ago, is the weakest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Hathaway and Brooke rushed over and asked Lu Xien for a copy of the paper. The mathematical ability of the two is also outstanding in the Arcanist, which is comparable to Douglas. Helen, Oliver, and Vicente are a lot stronger. Even Fernando is a cheaper person who has studied the journal Nature. Otherwise, it is not necessarily more than they understand. As for the legendary magician, only the predictor’s mathematics Ability is at their level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to start tomorrow, the number of "Nature" orders will be greatly improved, at least I will subscribe to one." Brooke did not have Lucien He recognizes the wrath of the world's broken and solidified, and smiles gracefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, due to the reputation of being the most incomprehensible journal, Nature has only booked a few percent of the Arcane. More people choose to go to the Arcane Library if they need it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a situation, despite the financial support of the Tower and Lucien, there will be no suspension, but Levski, Nesika, Mina and other arcans are also very distressed, and feel that their own research can not be recognized by the majority of arcane masters, but with the broadcast of Lu Xien today, the study of general relativity will become a boom, the vast majority of arcane Even if the teacher does not understand the theory, he will go to the journal Nature to read it, so that no one can talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "Mathematics is the tool and foundation of arcane research, the brightest jewel in the crown of the Arcane, so I want to do a copy." "Nature" journal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, many arcane masters are now limited to the mathematical level of analysing spell models, and they are not willing to be more careful in this regard. Going backwards, the more important the mathematical ability.” Hathaway is very indifferent to the discovery of the neutron. It seems that it is taken for granted, because she perceives the “eternal blaze” and “atomic fission” in the reverse direction, and many parts of the spell model. A neutron mapping must be introduced to be established. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she said something, it was a rare excuse to come out, not only a long sentence, but also no modification, perfectly showing her own language ability, as if it were gravitational essence Her explanation and genius-like arcane ideas made her feel a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook gently sighed: "You give me a lot of inspiration as a constant ruler, and your explanation of time and space is more thought-provoking, electromagnetic The field should definitely not only stay on the application of electromagnetic waves and electromagnetic forces, but to understand the essence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because to help Oliver, the two Arcanists did not To say more, the most important thing at the moment is to save Douglas and go back to research papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien patiently waited beside him. After a while, Helen walked out of the lab and rubbed his palm and said coldly: "It is indeed a neutron." I will take you to the treasure house of the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you can think of a tribute of your own, if you don't want to spend your thoughts, Oliver is happy. "To do it." Fernando laughed by the door of the transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the legacy of the magical empire, every legendary magician has his own unique tribute, and in the parliamentary era, extended this range to the unsuccessful legend The Arcane Master is closely related to the legendary profession and areas of expertise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the tribute to Douglas is "You are the electorate of magic, the master of the stars, your radiance illuminates the path of arcane advancement", Brooke's "You are the master of the electromagnetic kingdom, writing poems for the goddess", Oliver's "You let the elements return to the original meaning, shuttle in the field of time and space", Helen's is "you are the snow elf, dance The most beautiful change in the world, Vicente's is "Your eyes let the soul sleep, you are the master of death." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver heard his name, hehe smiled: "I have already thought of you, 'You are the truth of the element, the scepter of the time and space' , how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien found that the accident was more appropriate than he thought, so he smiled: "Sure enough, the tribute of poetry, "This."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the tribute, Lucien followed Helen to the end of the 35th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower and saw a fan. Inscribed with black gates with numerous horror patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen read the mantra, took out the "magic key", opened the door, and directly took Lucien into a small room inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
