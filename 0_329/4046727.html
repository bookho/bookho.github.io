			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we want to observe the fluctuating surname of electrons, when we experiment with a double-slit alchemy device, we will find it has obvious wave characteristics - interference fringes And when we try to observe the particle's last name of the electron, then when we add a recorder to each of the two gaps, the interference fringe disappears, and the pure particle name is revealed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the truth of the world? What do we want, what does electronics show? Observing changes in the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many arcane heads are messed up in a mess, more chaotic than parsing the magical meaning of magic, which involves their entire world. Know, know yourself! They used to think that only with the help of magic, the world will have all kinds of phenomena that are ridiculous and contrary to common sense. Who knows that the bottom and foundation of the real world - the microscopic field, is more wonderful than magic, and exaggerated than fantasy. local! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the embodiment of the principle of complementarity in the surname of the wave-particle two elephants? The volatility surname and the particle surname cannot appear together, one is certain, the other is instantaneous Disappeared, so it shows the principle of uncertainty?” Larry controlled his shock, surprise, excitement and excitement, thinking about the principle of arcane exhibited by the Xi’an electronic double-slit interference experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He warns himself that this time must not link the micro-domain to the macro-world, otherwise it will confuse cognition and will exist with the physical world. The contradiction of things makes them seem overwhelmed and even contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the micro-domain transitions to the macro-world, there are definitely other factors that affect the wave function, so that the wave name disappears and the particle name is determined... "Annick, Sprint, Dieppe, Timothy and other Arcanists also constantly remind themselves, otherwise they will be shaken by Lucien's electronic double-slit interference experiment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by convinced similar ideas can they accept the experimental results of the current microscopic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is perhaps the most subversive and most incredible area in the history of arcane and magic! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle and lower level arcans are still in the state of beginners in the microscopic field, and they have not built their own cognitive world, but the microscopic fields are incredible. The results and inferences are contradictory to the common sense of the macro-world. These common senses are the basis of their outlook on life, world outlook, and values. Therefore, they still have a look of expression or sorrow or pain, and they have tasted the uncontrollable state of the three views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a three-view ruin..." I don’t know how many arcane masters cursed in fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong impact of the electronic double-slit interference experiment slowly subsided, and Larry, Dieppe, Annick, Sprint and other microscopic fields The surgeon slightly exuded the expression of excitement. This experiment gave them a deeper understanding of the wave-particle two-image surname and complementary principle of electrons, and was full of enthusiasm for exploration in the microscopic field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a problem." Suddenly, Oliver, whose expression was slightly distorted, stepped forward, and the dim light around him returned to normal. He almost recognized it. The world is shaken and hurts itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly dagger: "Although ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry, Dieppe curious Looking at the past: "What question does Lord Oliver have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver took a breath: "Observing the result of the change, what is the specific definition of this observation? The transition from micro-domain to macro-world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This observation refers to our observation of electrons by various means." Lucien calmly answered The eyes hang down and cover the emotions in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver has calmed down, his mouth is smiling, in a poet-like tone: "The core is us? Then I have a thinking experiment, I think everyone is Do you know the decay of the nucleus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha, Rachel, Heidi, etc. all quietly nodded, elemental decay is the microscopic field One of the branches, the storm dominates Lord and the elemental dominator, who has just won the Evans Arcane Award for his research, and it represents a new energy direction, representing a powerful killing surname legendary magic, no arcane The teacher does not pay attention to this field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He described a sophisticated experimental design that, when the decay of the nucleus releases a neutron, triggers a series of reactions that eventually breaks a glass bottle containing a fatal curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we put a poor cat into this experimental device, as normal, we can describe this, this cat has five percent Ten may be cursed and killed." When Oliver explained the experimental device, Annick and Sprint's face suddenly became pale, and they seemed to think of something terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diyup, Larry, Yurisian and other excellent arcanists in the micro-field can’t help but tremble with both hands, their faces are blue, because they probably guess When he wants to express what Oliver wants to express, he wants to connect the microscopic field with the macro world through simple and clever experimental devices! And this is the problem they have been forced to escape before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the curiosity of most of the arcans, Oliver’s voice rose slightly: “If we seal this experimental device and do not observe it, then according to Lucien The interpretation, the atomic nucleus belonging to the microscopic field will exhibit a quantum superposition state, in a mixed superposition of decay and non-decay, such a magical state will not be randomly collapsed into a certain result until we observe it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I want to ask everyone is, what a poor cat? If it decays, it will die, and if it does not decay, it will be alive. The quantum superposition of the atom is equivalent to it. The state of the place? This means that it is in a quantum superposition state of life and death in the experimental device?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or the observation of the cat will also cause the wave function to collapse, so that the result is determined?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚, Larry, Di The face of Jeep and others has become pale, and the superposition of life and death? A dead and dead cat? No magic will produce this state! Lord Oliver magnified the wonders of the microscopic field into the macro world with exquisite and simple experiments! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes them no longer able to ignore this issue, which makes them have to face the huge contradiction between the micro-domain and the macro-world, and have to think about the mystery of the transition, if not It is the Archaeologist who proposed this experiment. Sprint wants to say that I am going to kill the cat, so there is no contradiction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just recognized by the interpretation of Lucien by the electronic double-slit interference experiment, their faces are burning pains, and they seem to have been fanned out. hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver looked at the silent Lucien on the podium: "What state is this cat in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the factual transformation of the immortal martyrdom and Lucien, his concept of quantum superposition is not exclusive, but what he does not understand is the quantum superposition state at what scale can be established, electrons, protons, Microscopic particles such as atoms can still extend to molecules, extend to cells, extend to ordinary organisms, and extend to intelligent life. Only by clarifying this limit can we find the reason for the disappearance of the quantum superposition state, thus laying the foundation of the arcane for the road of the gods with no hidden dangers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he is dissatisfied with the rough interpretation of the disappearance of the quantum superposition state by Lucian observation, and human observation will cause collapse, what about other intelligent life? What about ordinary cats without magic? What is the material without life? What about smaller scale molecules? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Oliver’s questioning, everyone’s eyes were concentrated on Lucien, waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien still squinted down and said: "Yes, the cat is in a quantum superposition of life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" I don't know how many voices sounded, the superposition of life and death? Cats can be in this state, humans? Why have we never felt it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Arcanists listened silently to the conversation between the two, and Oliver said with a low voice: "What about humans? It’s not the one in the experimental setup. Poor cat, but human? He is also in a quantum superposition of life and death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this time the wave function collapses and the result is determined It is either born or dead, there will be no superposition of life and death." Lucien seems to answer quickly as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver stepped forward again: "Where is the difference between the man and the cat? Why does the observation of the former cause the wave function to collapse and the quantum superposition state to disappear, while the latter No?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This? ! All the arcane masters were shocked. They never thought that Lucien would be such an explanation. If the consciousness and the wise observer are the cause of the disappearance of the quantum superposition state, then many terrible facts will be derived! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando, who has been patient for a long time, growls, and the horrible pressure is generated in the big classroom: "That is, before the emergence of conscious observers, the whole world, the whole The universe, in the state of the wave function, is in a state of pervasiveness without a substantial probability cloud, and then after a long wait, the first observer is born, and then the universe and the world are curled up, showing what we see now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pervasiveness of the universe for hundreds of millions of years, just to wait for the "you" affectionate glimpse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ridiculous! It’s a mad dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't this be the case? The world before the first observer is something we can't understand. What is the meaning of what state it is?" En did not look at the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas couldn’t help but said seriously: “Does that mean there is a first observer, the first supreme observer? This is what you mean. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Brooke, Oliver can't agree, even Helen and Hathaway, who are relatively more accepting Lucien's interpretation, are firmly after his explanation by the observer. Shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly looked up and looked at all the Arcanists: "Don't you think about why there is extraordinary power? Why is there magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From consciousness, starting from the observer effect, maybe a path!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnetic introversion The voice echoed in the big classroom and hit the hearts of all the Arcans, including Douglas, Brooke, and Fernando. Yes, what is the essence of magic? This is the question that has been explored since the establishment of the Parliament! This is a problem that will inevitably occur after humans have witnessed all kinds of extraordinary phenomena! Unless humans stop thinking, spend the rest of their lives like a cat or dog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you understand the truth of the world, the more doubt the arcade masters have on this issue, just like Lucien’s uncertain surname principle, because it’s close to the real world. There seems to be no place for magic in the law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness, observer effect, maybe it is the way to explain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick looked at the teacher on the podium, and he was struggling with his heart. The teacher was so demeanor, so majestic, so powerful, always The correct surname makes people can't help but believe his words, follow his footsteps, he is the most authoritative master of the microscopic field and the macro starry sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my own mind, the teacher is so tall, like a mountain, is the existence that he has looked up all his life, is an idol that he can hardly catch up with and can't keep up with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, but why does the teacher explain this to the transition from the micro-domain to the macro-domain, that is, the collapse of the wave function? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the past experience and my imagination deceiving me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking sideways, he saw the look of Heidi, Katrina and other students who did not understand, and saw the distorted face of Sprint’s teeth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strange silence, Lucien’s low and mellow voice rang again: “The first observer may not be extraordinary, perhaps like us.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the supreme observer that the Speaker of the Lord is worried about, that is, the god who throws the scorpion, we can ignore it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recalling the experiment just now, my observations led to changes in the quality of the electronic surname, and such observations, I can complete, each of you can complete."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god who throws the dice does exist, but He is not outside, and in each of us, each of us is our supreme god!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
