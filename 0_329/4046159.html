			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe pale as a smile on the face of the undead: "Mr. Professor, you have extraordinary insights and unique perspectives in the field of elemental magic, I miss you. Such a person will never have no fame and status. In fact, I am very curious, are you the ones I am familiar with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The higher the degree of surgery, the more he grasps his true strength and becomes hesitant. Although he is always confident, he does not doubt that his strength is definitely the most sturdy grade under the high-level magician. But a magician who can have such a high level of arcaneism and knowledge may not be much worse than himself. It really seems to be a fight. It seems that it is easy to lose both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard Felipe’s evaluation and realized that he had been smothered, and the deliberately changed voice answered with a smile: “May be waiting for me. Become a high-ranking magician and meet in Allinge, I will consider telling Felipe you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No use of "Mr.", suggesting two People did meet at the mainland Magic Council headquarters and were familiar people. Lucien should have his own level of judgment on the self-purifying sequence, so he did not cover up and did not care to show that he had not become a high-level magician. He tried to give Felipe his strength with such frank and confident attitude. Mysterious and unpredictable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s breath suddenly became dangerous and seemed to be ready to start! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s face is still calm, but the heart is getting tighter, and his own foxes and all the coups are built on each other’s sensible and sober magic. Above the division, such characters know how to weigh the pros and cons and the strength, but if the other side hides the tendency of adventure or madness, then it is very dangerous! Your own strength and magical items are absolutely difficult to compete with the senior three-ring magician, not to mention Felipe is likely to be close to the high-order existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumored Necromancer is more insane than the magicians of other departments." Lucien flashed inexplicable thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere has become silent and quiet, and the Viscount of Karendia, who is like a leisurely, has stopped tasting red wine and is ready to guard, although he does not want to blend The matter of the Magic Council, but here is his castle. After being destroyed, it will be a heavy loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more dangerous the critical moment, the more calm Lucerne calmed down, calmed down, calmly picked up the Nieder housekeeper and put it on the coffee table. The black tea has a sneak peek: "Felipe, if you don't have other problems in the elemental field, I want to talk to you about the ancient magic of the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Since he is testing his own standards, he must also have a corresponding attitude. At this time, he will retreat and not conform to the identity of the "spoiler." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to test my magical strength? Don't you worry about taking the opportunity to learn the unique magic of the Necromancer he wants to discuss?" Felipe fell into disbelief The dangerous momentum, "Unless, he thinks I can't learn it at all! And there is only two possibilities for learning, or the structure of this unique magic can be disassembled, it is difficult to reverse all of it, or I will be Dead, the dead are stealing from school without any magic! Hey, can you teach me so little?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringing for a few tens of seconds When Pei was preparing to speak, he suddenly heard the voice of Viscount Kareldia: "Oh, the two gentlemen, the time for the death feast is coming, what can be exchanged and so on."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of his magnetic name broke the extremely oppressive atmosphere in the study, and Felipe quietly sighed and stood up: "The discussion with Mr. Professor is too invested, no attention To the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost a collapse between weakness Lucien forcibly supported and smiled and got up: "Me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nide Butler, you first take the professor to the hall, I have a little delay in Ferry Mr. Pei has two or three minutes.” Viscount Kareldia put the red wine glass on the window sill, and took a long leg to Felipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien and Ned left the study, Viscount Kareldia looked at Felipe and smiled: "Mr. Felipe, maybe you I don't care, but this is the old castle that my grandfather left. It is something I cherish very much, so if you really want to fight, please solve it quickly, or don't blame me for asking you to go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slightly mad Felipe dictionary, the words "respect for the master" need to be preceded by "the master has enough strength to be respected." Although the Viscount of Karendia is not a high-order vampire, but the strength is not worse than this, here is the inside of his castle, really fighting, he may not be able to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe, it’s great that you can understand. I will also marry Mr. Professor." Viscount Kareldia stepped into the door of the study. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferry wears Cleveland slowly behind, and his expression is as pale as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, why not just try it out? The professor is obviously afraid of you when he sees the dress that is not light." High and strong, at least younger than Felipe The middle-aged man Cleveland called Felipe was a no-brainer. In the world of magic, you have enough strength and knowledge to get the corresponding respect and treatment. "And he will definitely try to destroy your arrangement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe shook his head: "Fortunately, tempted, did not go crazy directly. I now raise the grade of the professor's strength to a higher level, no wonder he can go to the church's purification sequence. As long as he does not touch The bottom line, it is best not to risk fighting with him." He still maintains enough confidence in his own strength, that the reason he did not have a purification sequence is simply that there is nothing to do with the pains of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop, Felipe looked at Cleveland sideways and seemed to be ready to teach a few words, but after he opened his mouth, he still gloomy Put your hands in the windbreaker pocket and walk silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization of things is organized, their own things are their own, and the attitudes required are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Behind the serious and ignorant Nieder’s housekeeper, Lucien felt that his legs were so weak and weak, facing Felipe When it comes to this magical and powerful magician, camouflage and counterfeiting are the test of will and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The organization that is hostile to the elemental will or the Holm Royal Demon Court seems to be called the 'Pale Hand', which sounds like an organization between Necromancers, Is Felipe holding a death feast in preparation for recruiting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In such cases, you can't directly ask Felipe about the Stirke City Liaison Identity, because as a 'intermediate magician' is completely able to fly through the storm straits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a chance to test, no chance Never risk, anyway, to Stourke, there is hope to find out. Oh, for this matter is actually involved in such a serious dangerous situation, and it is very likely to return empty-handed. I only hope that Felipe and so on can Say it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas that have passed away, and Lucien walked into the hall calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotten smell rushed to the ground, letting Lucien have the feeling of being in a cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement in the hall is like the Alto nobles holding a dance party, a wide and bright space, a long table filled with food, a smartly stacked wine glass, carrying a tray The waiters who are interspersed, the melodious music, etc. are all so elegant and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only inconsistency is the sullen black robe mage and apprentices who carry food, hold glasses, and carry pockets from time to time. Take out the white flowering brain, the dead eyeballs, the crunchy skull, the rotten heart, and the complete baby carcass and other materials and items to exchange the things or money you need. This is a very rare occasion with so many apprentices and magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was not afraid of the body, I used to play the internal organs, but it was only a specific occasion, so now Lucien sees this scene, it is gone immediately. Appetite, the heart slightly sighed: "The magician is regarded as a symbol of evil by the people of the entire continent, and the performance of the Necromancer is definitely the most important factor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Hello, Professor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... The magic apprentices saw Lu Xien passing by, and they quickly bowed their heads and humbled and humbled, this is a powerful tycoon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
