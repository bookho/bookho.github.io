			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas patted the handrail of the sofa: "Since the establishment of the parliament, since the 'heart of faith' must be built on the 'God of Truth' The inner piety and the conviction of the heart cannot be shaken too much. Therefore, only the magician quietly believes in the god of truth or is bought by the money and materials of the church. There has never been a cleric at the bishop level to become a spy of the parliament. Now, intelligence On the other hand, we finally have no need to be beaten passively. Viken definitely never thinks that the cardinal will secretly serve the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this is a very emotional In the past few hundred years, the parliament has been filled with many spies of truth gods. Sometimes, the members of the highest panel of judges know who is colluding with the church, not to expose him, to judge him, but to pass the mistakes through them. Intelligence, counteracting the effects of other undiscovered spies - although there are souls that dominate the "authority" of invading the brain to search for memories, so many people in the parliament, most magicians have their own secrets, However, not one investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, repeated subversive theories, the subversive theory of the Holy Scriptures and the Holy Scriptures, to some extent, cleaned the truth of faith. The part of God’s spy, after the Battle of Rentat, the Southern Church was driven away, the impact on the four countries of the Straits and the North Coastal Corridor was minimized, and the spies within the parliament were really reduced to the extent that they did not affect the situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correspondingly, no matter how many clerics live a corrupt and corrupt life, regardless of whether they have a bitter hatred with the "supervisor" or "peer", Once you work with a magician, it means turning away from the god of truth. The heart of faith will inevitably be shaken and then swallowed by the Holy Light. Therefore, the Magic Council can only arrange some spies at the priest level, and these spies are not pure because of their faith. There is no hope for advanced bishop level in life. More often, I have to rely on magic such as "invading the brain" to collect intelligence at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was very surprised before, why the Pope and the saints of the Northern Church can cooperate with us unaffected, why do they like to use faith? The heart swears," Lucien guessed the general situation when he knew that he could steal the power of faith, but it was not until he started the real way to fully understand what it was. . The connection between their "belief heart" and "Heavenly Mountain" is partially manipulated by the help of "divineness", which can change the rules within a certain degree. If you "think" not to violate the belief of the Lord, you will not violate it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded lightly: "At the Northern Church, we also have to arrange some cardinal-level spies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged: "Although the methods of stealing and using the power of faith are directly announced to them. Not mentioning the equivalent requirements will reduce our control over them, but if they do not, they I will definitely not believe in us. Only by seeing the real things and getting real benefits, will they get deeper and deeper on this road. Can't look back. And this is what we expect to see." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the control of them, one is threatening, at least until they become legendary, they are not qualified to steal and use the power of faith, once exposed, they will definitely be cardinal The regiment was sent to the firearms in the name of fallen and demonized. Although the members of these cardinal ecclesiastical groups can be regarded as major bureaus. But they are related to their own strength, and certainly do not want to share the power of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s old Step by step to become a Holy Spirit pastor or holy knight, the cardinal group members will not be embarrassed, but will share the method to them, after all, the danger of the rapid rise of the magical parliament makes them very vigilant, soberly aware of the need to strengthen the legendary level Strength, let the legendary number recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas said here and took a look at Lucien: "The second method of control is to induce, we control the coastal four countries and the northern coastal corridor, control Huge resources of believers, as long as they are willing to cooperate with us, we can help them steal the faith of sects such as Holm State Education. This is a safe and generous resource. They must not be tempted. After all, they must be careful when stealing them internally. It’s easy to be discovered by the Cardinal members when it’s overheated.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holm State Church is closely attached to the Holm Kingdom, so Douglas did not make this suggestion. In a positive tone, ask for advice from Lucien. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no problem, Holm State is just a tool to help us stabilize believers. If they are strong, they are not good for us, and they are equally disadvantageous to Holm. It’s almost like maintaining one or two Holy Spirit priests or holy knights, and I’m worried that Viken has secretly told the archbishop’s archbishops about the laws of the gods.” Lucien’s slight decapitation, the Holm kingdom is only two An epic knight, if the number of legends of Holm State is greater than them, it is inevitable that the end of the game will be reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly mentioned the steam church, and seemed to understand another purpose of Lucian's research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was an idea in this area, but there was no information at the time and I could only explore it myself, but the action of Viken gave me the inspiration to mix the situation." Lucien Hehe laughed, he is not really unscrupulous, many things are by analogy, get inspiration, otherwise they have long exchanged 'data' with the northern church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Lucien’s expression suddenly slammed, and then he took out a dark green non-legendary puppet of his own refinement and saw it dyed on it. A touch of bright redness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a cardinal contact me? So fast?" Lucien was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looks as usual: "Maybe there is important information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, my projection Look at the past." Lucien said to Douglas, here is his half-plane, he must pass his consent to project near the holy city of Reims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage rides steadily on the outskirts of the holy city of Reims On the boulevard boulevard, a manor that has been on the edge of the forest has stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Myers, thank you for hosting the christening ceremony of our home." The owner of the manor, a viscount respectfully walked down the red of the carriage The cardinal rituals are full of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his deceased father had a very good relationship with the cardinal, he knew that he and the other’s status were too different and did not expect the other person to be himself. The little son baptized, who knows, the polite invitation actually got the consent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father and I grew up together, you are welcome, I will go to the chapel to bathe and clean, pray in peace, and baptize tomorrow." Sri Lanka is a pale-haired old man with a calm but majestic appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the chapel of the chapel, Myers fell to the cross and began to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night was quiet, he looked up and looked at the cross and the inlaid truth of the holy emblem in a complex look, then took out a delicate puppet and gently put it excitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This puppet suddenly glowed red, like moving his limbs with life, then leaping violently, and the funny face looked at Myers:" Are you calling me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the puppet, which is only the size of his thumb, Myers has a deep disgust in his heart, taking a deep breath:" We have got the secret of the artificial planet, this is the information you need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fake artificial planet, although hosted by the Holy Spirit, is also inseparable from the red The cooperation of the bishops, after all, they are not the Arcanist. This one is equivalent to a team of researchers, and can do everything on their own. Therefore, Lucien’s goal of using the power of faith includes the “Highest Seminary” of Myers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, it’s awesome, I appreciate you." The red light on the puppet devours the information that Myers took out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myers sullenly said: "I have fulfilled your request and will not bother me anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? Then I am going to bother with Philip, Estila, Maria, or Baha'u'llah?" The puppet laughed, the first three are cardinals who are in charge of theological matters. The latter is the referee giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myers is angry and said: "Devil, don't you say that you don't threaten me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whenever you say that you believe it? I know that you know very well, as long as you don't use this method, I will never threaten you, but if you use it, you can acquiesce me to threaten you." The puppet's face is getting more and more funny. "Do you choose your own choice, don't blame me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil, damn devil." Myers gnashed his teeth, but there was no rebellious move. When he tried this method and succeeded, he already understood the price he was willing to pay for it. "I warn you, you can't ask too much, otherwise I would rather confess to the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
