			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing the red blood around the fog, Lucien’s hands and feet are soft, his head twitching and swelling, and the scene of Correa and Howen’s wrestling It turned into Correa and the giant mouse, and it turned back to killing each other, just like the illusion and reality overlap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, illusion?!" Lucien thought of this, and there was a general speculation in his heart, focusing on the spirit that spread the spirit. Feelings appear, so the scene no longer changes, the red fog is no longer distorted, everything is stable, and it is indeed Correa and Howson that kills life and death. There are many wounds in their bodies, and their movements seem very slow and strenuous. It seems to have reached a limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the blood of the red-eyed mouse itself having a hallucinogenic effect, or is the blood illusory after the absorption and transformation of the strange plant? It is a clever one. Magic trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien finally understands that no matter whether Johnson’s disappearance or Gary’s sudden attack is due to the influence of hallucinations, this effect is likely From the time of killing the first red-eyed mouse to the complete blinding of the senses, it is difficult to distinguish. Only Lu Xien was able to get rid of the illusion because of the protection of the Holy Light shield and the improvement of the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Light Strike" just shot from the Truth of the Truth not only gasified Gary's right hand and part of his shoulder, but also penetrated the top and directly hit the Chamber of Secrets. The top of the stone above it, played a deep hole, the gravel fell like rain, as if the entire chamber would collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravel, the dust filled, and the red blood fog was dissipated, and the situation of Lucien's hands and feet was restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien doesn’t know if there are any other magic traps in the chain, so even if you are temporarily safe, don’t dare to relax, think about it quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Truth of the Truth", in addition to the two radiance techniques, can no longer stimulate any magic, and has no maximum dependence, even the power of its own body. It became very weak due to the paralytic effect contained in the reddish mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien saw the strange plant swaying in the gravel that Sassoh fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to creating hallucinations, does it have no other ability to protect itself?" Lucien immediately woke up and stood up with his weak hands and feet. The strange plant went. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no strength, stumbling, Lucian walks very slowly, falls a few times in the gravel, is covered with scars, pain is unbearable, There are even a few berths that flow out of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Lucien breathed a sigh of relief, resisting the pain, and by the temporary sobriety and strength of the wound pain, he went to the hard Strain strange plants next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this series of encounters, Lucien’s youth and sorrows were much less, without delay, holding his breath, carefully but firmly extending his right hand. , held on the trunk of the strange plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a series of meridians that are beating, creek-like blood is running, and Lucien feels that he is not holding a plant, but a living creature, and then Slammed to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the branches of this strange plant shrink and make sharp and stern Screaming, like a dying person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without tearing down, Lucien continued to use force, and the strange plant made a scream of screams, and then re-stretched the branches and leaves, and wrapped around Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of wetness, slipperiness and nausea came from the skin, and countless tiny burrs were plunged into their bodies. Lucien forcibly resisted fear and fear, again Pull hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying abruptly stopped, Lucien was planted in the body The light red liquid sprayed on the chest, and the bloody smell came out. This made Lucien's more and more hands and feet soft and could only rely on the stone wall next to avoid falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three books on the nearby desk, shimmering and shimmering, quickly eroded, and from the first page to the last page, it took only two or three seconds to completely Disappeared, Lucy, this nearby person did not see what was written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, with Lucien’s current physical paralysis, it’s definitely too late to stop, even taking a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desk immediately became empty, but the strange thing was that except for the place where the three books were located, there was no trace of corrosion, and Lucien was short-lived. After that, I wanted to understand the key points: "It seems to be a magic trap. When the concentration of red mist reaches a certain level, the magic traps on those magic notes will start on their own, destroying themselves, so as not to be obtained by the enemy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately these few magic notes." Lucian was very sorry to sigh in his heart, but it was able to learn the magical notes of extraordinary power. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien glimpsed, and he found the library in his soul to make a strange gleam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under curiosity, Lucien explored the spirit and then saw through his eyes a new bookcase in the library with the words " There are a few words of magic (Arcane), and on the bookshelf, there are already three books, exactly the three magic notes that Lu Xien saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the library have the ability to collect books? But how did the content come from?" Lucien was surprised. "Or I need to see the content with my own eyes." OK, well, these three books have been eroded very quickly, but if you slow down the whole process, you should still be eroded one page at a time. This strange library can remember the contents from beginning to end, so there is The projection of these three books, otherwise it is impossible to fabricate the content out of thin air."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can only guess at the moment, have to wait for other books to do later The experiment can be affirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these three magic notes, Lucien, who was quite sorry, just hesitated: "If you learn magic, you can be open in this magic. Will it be too dangerous to burn the world of magicians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to make a decision, Lucien will temporarily put it down, after all, he and others are still In the secret room, it was not completely out of danger, so Lucien began to accumulate strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no strange plant, the reddish blood is getting weaker and thinner, Correa and Howson are gradually getting rid of the illusion, looking at each other with shock, can be awake It’s already a lot late, and both of them are on the verge of dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Benjamin on the ground, in Lucian, touched the truth with the spirit The Holy Emblem, while stimulating the "Light Strike", snorted, put down his right hand, and looked at the secret road with suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Benjamin adults?" Guarding Paul saw Benjamin's strange performance and hurriedly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the silver moon, Benjamin’s face became very bad, and he whispered: “There is a change below, my spiritual mark in the emblem is It’s touched, damn, just a magic apprentice, it’s useless to get this point! Paul, you are waiting for me here, if I haven’t come out in five minutes, you will ask the bishop for help.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the existence of the spiritual imprint in the Holy Emblem, Benjamin can safely hand over the Truth of the Holy Spirit to Lucien, or even the standard god of the Holy Emblem Compared with Benjamin’s own strength and other magical things in his body, the odds are much weaker. He will not give it to others casually. Who knows that his spiritual mark has been touched and he has not been able to stop at a critical moment. The magic should not be stimulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neglect and carelessness has always been a companion to arrogance and prejudice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Benjamin’s heart, there is a deep prejudice against the knights who rely on the physical strength of the blood, thinking that they are rough, low-lying, not at all noble. The casters who explore the mysteries of the world, even if they are evil wizards, are therefore not worthy of using magical objects. Therefore, he subconsciously gives the truth to the Lucian, who is more spiritual than ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude comes from Benjamin’s origins and comes from his long-standing experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, as a formal pastor, such a small matter has been greatly overlooked, and the status inside the church will inevitably be affected, so Benjamin rushed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul is as surprised: "There is a sacred emblem of truth, will there be a change? Is there any other official magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s strength has recovered a bit, and is about to walk against the secret room by the stone wall. Suddenly I heard a footstep heard, and suddenly my heart was lifted up, and my spirit was tense. If it came to the magic creature left by the witch or her friend, I was afraid that it would be difficult to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Benjamin’s white holy robes, Lucien was relieved, but still couldn’t relax, how good the murder was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lapland blood vine?" Benjamin took a look at the situation in the secret room, quickly judging the general process from the magical knowledge of learning, plant knowledge, etc. I understand why Lucien, who is slow to move against the wall, and Gary, who is on the verge of dying, fall into such a situation. "Fortunately, they have not died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This kid is lucky, his mental strength has increased a bit, reaching the level of the low-level trainee pastor. It seems that the impact brought by the breakthrough touched my spiritual mark, but unfortunately it is not more than three hundred years ago. The church is very powerful, and it is possible to learn the age of magic by virtue of talent. Without learning the basics of the gods, we can never become a formal priest. I have to say that it is indeed the 'Arcane Emperor'. It opened the golden age of nearly four hundred years of rapid development of magic and magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Lafayette family, Benjamin knows more than most pastors. More world situation, for yourself Faith does not seem so pious, to be precise, as an aristocrat Benjamin, and Benjamin, and as a church, and in the position is somewhat contradictory. More importantly, after the "Supreme Theological Conference" more than three hundred years ago, the church split, one south and one north, blaming each other for heresy. Even so, no matter which side, the acquisition of magic has not been affected, which makes many bishops and cardinals silently doubt in their hearts that God does not exist. Is this a test for believers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude directly affects every young person who has become a pastor for hundreds of years, including Benjamin. Moreover, in order to adapt to the era of rapid development, several popes have introduced the Arcane Masters to explore some of the knowledge gained in the world to transform the theological foundation, although the same is true. The rapid development and the emergence of the strong, the Southern Church has maintained the position of the greatest power, standing in the eyes of many powerful enemies such as heretics, evil magicians, dark creatures, etc., but once again let the internal beliefs that are unstable More cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin relaxed, his hands slipped into the thin white dust, and the mouth uttered a weird syllable. A strong wind blew through and the red blood was blown away. no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he didn’t recite the spell, and he didn’t throw the casting material, just pointing to Gary, a pale white light fell on him and let him The burnt blacks fall off, the wounds heal, get rid of dying, and become ordinary serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time interval between one and two seconds to apply healing therapies, Benjamin saved Correa and Howson, and also on Lucien. The injury is cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking about the things of Lucien, Correa, Howson, Gary, etc., Benjamin looked at the desk and determined that they did not lie, he told: "Moving all the items in the secret room to the church, well, including the bodies of these mice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he caught the road to come to Lucien Emblem: "The sin of your body has been washed, go back to rest, may the Lord bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Ruthen Sean was successful this time, Benjamin was I won’t be rewarded with money, and even if I have the chance, I will secretly try to cultivate it, but if it is so dangerous, Benjamin will naturally no longer encourage Lucien to make sure that there is nothing hidden in him. Send him away, after all, Correa, Howson is okay, Gary, who has no right hand, is more troublesome, and limb regeneration is not the magic he can master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw Benjamin’s move without killing people, and there was still a mind to stay here, and quickly went to the outside of the room. When he went outside the sewer, the spirit broke through. A certain limit of Lucien suddenly heard a sentence from Correa, which made Lucien feel a bit heavy. He whispered to Hausen: "Gary has no right hand, I am afraid I can't be a knight, and I will be Please leave the guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
