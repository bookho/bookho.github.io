			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart City East is known as the "land of thousands of lakes", large and small lakes smooth like a mirror, like a piece of green agate, surrounded by lush green The woods are in harmony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This beautiful place is naturally occupied by the royal family and the great aristocrats. The private estate of James Duke of Pefors is located on a gentle lake that does not have undulating waves. It makes people feel relaxed and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dragon-drawn horse-drawn carriage slowly stopped at the gate of the manor, fat Arthur disregarded his own awkward action, grabbed the door in front of Lucien , jumped down, and then made a gesture of helping the road to Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head, stepping forward and appearing directly behind Arthur, seemingly saying to himself: "What do you mean by doing this?" As long as you manage Holm Mining Union Bank, Minerals and Harvest Company, it is the best performance before the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Patrick "invests" The shares were undoubtedly inherited by Natasha, so Lucien often ridiculed her, and she worked hard to invent magic items, and made a great fortune, and there was no need to worry about the exchange of magic materials before the promotion of the legend. She is proud and proud, but she only surpasses her own family by inheriting her inheritance. It is really enviable and hateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur turned and followed the side of Lucien, and smiled blushingly: "I am sincerely respecting Lucien, you invented The alchemy material and magical items gave me an unimaginable wealth, and I also managed to squeeze into the core circle of the Duke of James, so I just had a genuine action and no other purpose. You said Her Majesty the Minerals and Harvest Company The promotion and development is very satisfactory, then Holm Mining Union Bank? Did she say anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen's Majesty from Waorit, against the storm The banking industry that emerged in the countries around the Straits is still not well understood, so there is nothing to comment on. You should find an opportunity to write a report about the bank's introduction and future directions to submit to her." Lucien understands that to promote magic Articles, which influence the people of the middle and lower floors of Holm and Burriana in a subtle way, must be grasped in three directions. One is the simplification of magical items, the scale of production and the streamlining, and the second is the bank. Gold Support and the third is master of public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise of everything is based on the strength of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Arthur said with a wink, and the fat on the face with a puffy feeling piled up, and the eyes became a line. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is a soldier wearing two dark red dresses, indicating that Natasha has arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through them, led by a servant, Lucien and Arthur went to the most eye-catching gardens of the entire manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This garden is the pride of the Duke of James, claiming to be second only to the royal family, the lake is a vast area, full of flowers, and smoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the garden, it is a relatively open-air banquet place, overlooking the lake and the mountains, surrounded by flowers and trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping into the banquet, Lucien’s gaze noticed Natasha, she wore a black dress that was closer to the safari, with long purple hair. Pulling up, the silver and purple eyes are deep and deep, and the temperament is more calm and calm. It seems that after so many days of adaptation, it finally turns into the real queen from the psychological condition of the Vientiane Countess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciating and watching Natasha with affection, Lucien’s mood is very good, like a little bit of inner peace in such a few days, even if nothing Do not do it, so quietly watching her is also very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the feeling of Lucien’s gaze, Natasha’s head turned slightly, her eyes lifted, and she was connected with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-purple pupil seems to have a radiant glow, and the corner of the mouth couldn’t help but tilt up. It seems that she did not know that the Duke of James had invited Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Natasha quickly converges on the changes in expression and continues to talk to the surrounding nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a pair of silky black gloves that matched the style of her clothes, and did not take off when she accepted the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Natasha looked at Lucien, who was gradually entering, with a polite smile: "I can't see you, my knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At that time, other less powerful aristocrats noticed the arrival of Lucien, and the conversation suddenly stopped, and including the Duke of James, the Duke of Russell, Arthur and others, their eyes were constantly sweeping on both of them, both curious. And look forward to trying to find a little bit of traces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is really a good friend, a musical partner, a knight who once loyal? Or is there a more intimate relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took off the top hat, pressed on the chest, kneeling on one knee, holding the right hand of Natasha on the left, separated by the knight's etiquette. Gloves gently kissed her back: "Her Majesty, your knight has never left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand trembled a little, seeming to think of something, Lucien also recalled the picture that described the moonlight scene before, and his face smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien let go of his hand, Natasha smiled and said: "I saw a lot of novelty in the Holm Kingdom, they Let the kingdom be full of vitality and vitality. This is the credit of Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at their polite attitude, listening to the normal conversation, There was some disappointment. They were like friends. They didn’t cross the border. There was no small detail to show a closer relationship. He thought that Lucien could eventually become the Queen’s husband, Prince Nexus, and he himself. I found the strongest backstage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James was quite disappointed, but in disappointment, he was very fortunate. They were afraid that Her Majesty really fell in love with Lucien. Evans, regardless of the division of the church to marry him, then break away from the original intention of himself and others, what they hope is Her Majesty and Lucien? Evans has an intimate relationship, but he has not reached the point where he is fascinated. He gets a child through him, stabilizes the kingship, and has a nominal virtual husband, keeping the church and the parliament in balance, or more biased. A little bit of parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether they will maintain a private lover relationship, it is not something they need to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to restrain myself, Lucien really talks to her like Natasha, like a good friend and the queen’s knight, from time to time by her and The conversations of other nobles were interrupted, and the whole scene was no different from the normal banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than 20 minutes, I couldn’t see anything, and the Duke of James laughed and said: "The Queen’s Majesty just mentioned the novelty items in the kingdom, just here. There are some, it’s better for me to lead you to visit the Queen, and the inventor, Mr. Lucian Evans, personally introduced it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Good.” Natasha Simply answer, understand that the Duke of James has something to communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Duke of James and other four enlightened parties, Lucien, Camille and another young man with silver-gray eyes surrounded Natasha Go inside the main manor house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is Earl of David, a fierce royal knight." The Duke of James introduced to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded: "I heard your father, Mr. Morris, who is an excellent magician."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davi has a distinct Hoffenberg family appearance, deep and hard, but the pair of silver-gray eyes let him reveal a bit cold and indifferent, he smiled: "Mr. Evans, I am very happy with your approval of my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not cold but not hot, as if he remembered the dead father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, a few people entered the main manor house and set foot on the red carpeted stairs. As the queen’s knight, Lucien naturally walked in the end, with Camille is "protected" by Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the Duke of James and others all crossed the corner of the stairs, Lucien’s left hand suddenly had a slightly cold and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha's hand?" Lucian turned to look at her with a slight surprise, just as opposed to her delighted eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s right hand did not know when she had taken off the silk gloves, and the warmth of the palm was clear and inconspicuous, in stark contrast to the courtesy of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both hands in the grip, Natasha looked back, but the corner of her mouth could not hide her smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the corner of the stairs, the two men released their hands at the same time, just like nothing to follow the Duke of James to finish the stairs and enter the Chamber of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, there is a tray with a glass of wine, red wine, champagne and "sky blue". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone checked, they each picked up a drink and looked at the Duke of James, waiting for him to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I just want to ask the Queen what is your attitude towards the promotion of alchemy workshops and magic items? Honestly, we have a lot of wealth to invest in. It’s here.” The Duke of James consciously grasped Natasha’s inclination and said it straight to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha maintains the majesty of the Queen: "I only have an attitude. All magical items that benefit the development of the kingdom and the people benefit are encouraged to promote, all evil, The degrading things are completely banned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Queen is not like the conservative people." The Duke Russell said with a smile, "I want to If you invest in the same thing, you can't find a profitable place. Mr. Evans doesn't know what advice you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What investment?" Lucien suddenly has The feeling of attending a business meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell sipped champagne and smiled: "It’s a radio station, like the voice of mystery and the world’s real radio, not just a few news programs and music. Appreciate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is keenly aware of the value of it, but it is difficult to figure out how to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked curiously at Lucian, privately, he seemed to have said this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "The main thing is that the magic radio is still very expensive. Although it has been simplified, it is basically only available to civilians above the middle level. It The popularity of the surname determines the profit direction of the radio."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What good advice, then simplify?" Earl of Pine is also very interested in this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at them with a deep meaning: "I suggest that the radio should also run a newspaper. If you subscribe to a newspaper for a year, send a magic radio. The popular surname will soon come up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be a serious loss!" Earl of Pine is the finance minister, very sensitive to this, a magic radio comparable The annual newspaper is much more expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Natasha: "There is a loss here, but it is the necessary price for promotion, and the revenue comes from advertising, I will push the phone. Telegraph companies, minerals and harvest companies give huge advertising fees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you will not lose money?" Natasha has some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed: "Advertising itself is an investment, and the effect must wait until the magic radio has been popularized. This cycle, we can wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a loss, it is worthwhile to control the direction of the publicity of Holm’s radio station through advertising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James just wanted to talk, and suddenly his face turned black, and the cup in his hand was crushed: "Toxic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the words were exported, Lucien felt that the toxins that spoiled the horror erupted from the body, but were immediately eliminated by the ring of Congas, but under the toxin, there was still a very weird curse power, which gave way. Sean is so drunk that he can't concentrate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a problem with the wine in this chamber? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t check it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anxious, Lucien looked down at Natasha, and her heart sank suddenly, because she also turned black and her hands trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James burst into tears: "Who is poisoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
