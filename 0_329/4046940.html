			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible light sweeps over Felipe and the mysterious man's body, and the silver-gray door opens back, revealing a colorful honeycomb snarl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the martyrdom, an old man wearing a red magic robe is looking at them with his eyes flashing and slamming his head. "Is it just Blaze?" Here? Otherwise, Hathaway's experiment will not be inexplicable! And, I can feel it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young man sneaks his teeth: "Maybe "...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he is very innocent: "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Bone Wall Clock" on the Dean's Tower emits a long but cold sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie just painted the last line in his soul, so the spell model slammed inwardly, madly absorbing the energy sea, life and Death is intertwined, and "power" continues to split and grow, bringing turbulent and violent changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsides, Donnie’s soul has a complicated “crystal”, which flows through mystery and contains mysterious, intuitive Presented, and this also shows that Downey crossed the apprenticeship stage and became a formal magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a breakthrough that countless magic apprentices dream of, but most apprentices are hard to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you become a formal magician, you can not only gain the power to easily kill apprentices and ordinary people, but also automatically become a municipal councillor in your home city, with the Lord and ordinary The baron is quite, for civilian children, it is equal to one step into the upper class! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie, who was born badly, looked at himself with joy and since he almost touched "black armor" a few months ago, he and Carl and Sami again I have never done a similar nightmare, life is stable, learning peace of mind, and the breakthrough of spiritual power is much easier than before, so after Carl and Sami, I can successfully break through before the New Year! This is also a good result among the apprentices of the Heidel School of Magic over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it became a formal magician before entering the Heidel School of Magic, most of the apprentices will have an official impact at the end of the first year. Qualifications of the ranks, few people can break through before the new year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I feel that the nightmare brought about the hardening of the soul, so the spiritual growth will be much faster and the foundation will be solid..." Tang Nisi thought in a hurry. "It’s just a nightmare. If you finally touch the black body armor, what kind of change will you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it’s controlled by the black armor, and the person can’t be too greedy... Well, let’s go home for the New Year’s holiday, thank you Mr. Dorothy by the way, without his generous help, I don’t know if I want to be a formal mage. How long..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Architectural calendar 24 years, the month of the ice The end of the wind, the wind is cold, dripping into ice, freezing the pedestrians tightly "shrink" in the coat, the hat is pressed low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unconsciously it was so cold..." Above the six-pointed star platform, Karl pulled his own men’s suit and deliberately vomited, so his mouth was white. The air is filled, like a mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie has become a formal magician, but at this time he did not give himself a spell against the cold, so he also shuddered and gathered himself. Black magic robe: "Yeah, it is winter to feel when you come to Rentat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler School of Magic is located in the world of the dead, the same season, monotonous Silence, the temperature is adjusted by the lock, the people inside can hardly feel the change of the season. After the death of the dead world, Heidele City is infected by the spirit of the dead spirit all the year round, and there is magic air conditioning heating in the magic steam train. Therefore, in addition to the snowy snow all the way, Downey and Karl have a sense of winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to go home, see you after the New Year's holiday." Carl smiled very sweetly. Then he waved his hand, "Right, Happy New Year!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the crowd that Carl disappeared on the platform, Downey sighed inexplicably. After half a year, he still didn't adapt to Carl's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head, got rid of this thought, and walked outside the platform. He had already decided to return to his home town tomorrow, and he had to visit and thank you today. Mr. Ross and several teachers who took care of themselves when they went to school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the Kaixuan Square, Donny is rushing to the “Knowledge Bookstore” and wants to tell Mr. Dorothy the good news of his promotion to the official Master as soon as possible. This is a A normal, simple "show off" and "share" mentality, how can Donnie be free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this?" Downey stood in front of the "Knowledge Bookstore" and didn't understand what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the door of the "Knowledge Bookstore" closed, with several sheets of paper on it, slightly faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I close the door?" Downey was surprised to approach, carefully discerning the words on the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner evaded tax evasion, special seal. Holm Tax Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Selling prohibited books, special joint seizure. Magical Parliamentary Discipline Department, Holm Police Department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Allegedly selling fake and inferior magical items, special joint sealing. Magic Parliamentary Discipline Department, Rentat City Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny looked stunned With these seals, I muttered to myself: "What did Mr. Doros do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years ago, with the further popularization of magical items and There are more and more different types of alchemy workshops, and the social life in Holm has undergone great changes. One of the distinctive features is that the division of labor is getting finer and finer. Therefore, the Duke of Heinrich, then prime minister, will mix in the past. A government department is split together to deal with this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems that Mr. Dorothy has sinned, but thinking of his help, Donnie still refuses to leave and find another small nearby The store owner, ask carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few months ago, the person in the Tax Office first summoned Dorothy, saying that he evaded taxes and tax evasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "After being summoned, Dorothy never returned. In the next few days, someone came to post a seal, hehe, a few."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I heard that Dorothy was locked up in the banned prison, and it will take at least five or six years to be released."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a formal mage on the chest Donnie of the chapter, the bosses of the nearby shops are not willing to hide, nor dare to use their own private tax collectors and police officers to obtain nicknames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forbidden Devil..." Downey whispered a whisper, struggled to hesitate, or decided to visit Mr. Dorothy, after all, he helped himself. Very big. Unfortunately, Downey was quickly disappointed because the members of the parliament told him that the banned prison in Dorothy was very far away, and his vacation was all on the same day. It was only enough to go back and forth, so he wrote a letter to Dorothy based on the advice of the staff member and left his contact point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the train entering the station scared all the children playing nearby with a frightened retreat, even the surrounding adults were slightly afraid, the town runs through the railway Not long after, the residents here are not accustomed to this behemoth that can run on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey slowly descended from the magic steam train, the familiar building in sight, the familiar distant mountains, the complex emotions in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, isn't that the Downey of White's family?" The town has few residents and is familiar with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
