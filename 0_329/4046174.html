			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ferryman" laughed and said: "Sturk's famous playwright Gerlos Astal, a scholar with six popular operas. He didn't care about the boatman in front of the boat because it was also the core staff of the Magic Council in Stourke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorcerer?" Lucien asked her identity on the bright side and asked with a little curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ferryman" looked at Lucien with a sigh of respect: "Yes, he is a shadow instructor."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was a little surprised: "Tutor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient magical empire, can be called a mentor At least a high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, although I don't know the specific level of Mr. Astar, he is undoubtedly a high-level magician. In fact, the Parliament is in Stuhr. There are also a few similar gentlemen, who all have the prominent identity on the bright side, but only go out on a long-term 'outside' and take turns to return to Stourke." The ferry turned to look at the water surface of the canal in front of it, "Parliament in the city Turck has more strength than you think, but their strong ones certainly won't be shot for small things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parliament in Stourke The stronger the strength, the more secure I am.” Lucien replied humorously. Although Sterk is very important, there are only a few high-ranking magicians sitting here, which proves the strength of the Magic Council in the Rhine. Description of the expansion and expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lively hustle and bustle on both sides, the sharp boat crossed the water like a sharp arrow and turned into a quiet and beautiful city in Stourke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The boat was parked in front of a three-storey villa with a large garden. Lucien and the ferry were digging a little bit in the water. The slippery stone steps went to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Tom, you are here." The guards of the goalkeeper clearly knew the ferry, and without much question, they opened the iron gate directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed the ferry with a smile, but he did not expect that he would give himself such a common, ubiquitous name, and always remind himself of That poor cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ferryman - Tom walks through the garden and the lawn and cares less: "The more common the name, the less likely it is to be noticed. For those of us who can't walk under the light, being watched often means death. Hehe, Mr. Evans also used the common name wisely, isn't it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, sometimes it is safer to be noticed by people, such as Mr. Astar." Lucien looked around and looked like a common villa, not found. A little trace of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;喵, a tiger-skinned cat with a tail, arrogant and elegant across the front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly it whispered in a hoarse voice: "Astall lets you go directly to the second floor, he is studying arcane, there is no time to greet you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cat talked so suddenly, almost scared Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom replied with a little fear: "Yes, Ms. Mercedes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next He introduced Lucien: "This is the magic pet of Mr. Astar, hey, partner, Ms. Mercedes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hello, Ms. Mercedes." Lucien said hello politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger cat cat snorted and answered, then walked into the garden next to it in an unhurried pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Tom silently walking to the door of the villa hall, Lucien looked back and looked around, accidentally saw that the proud tiger cat was jumping Going to try to catch a butterfly, I am very happy to play, without any signs of using magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, humans are no more happy than animals." Tom said softly, then pushed the wooden door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Under the sun, the second floor is transparent, but when Lucien followed Tom in the corridor, there is always a feeling of being covered by shadows. This feeling is inexplicable, it seems because it is worn. Produced by 冕". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a dark wooden door, Tom tapped softly: "Mr. Astar, we are here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in. The door is unlocked." A low, dull voice came from inside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was pushed open carefully, Tom turned and signaled Lucien to go in together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of paper balls on the gray and heavy carpet, which was the first impression of Lucien on the study, and then I saw the mahogany On the desk, a feather pen that nobody holds is writing on the white paper, and from time to time, it sticks into the ink bottle next to the bounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Mr. Astar?" Lucien was first stunned by the small earthquake in this magical scene, and then he was puzzled and looked around, but only saw it. The bookshelf filled with various style books, did not find the shadow instructor. Tom next to <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bent down and picked up the paper on the carpet and put it in the trash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to find Astar’s Lucian, he curiously learned that Tom bent over and picked up a paper ball that was not tight, through the paper The gap saw the dense mathematical formula and calculation process inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because random peeks into other people’s arcane studies are likely to have terrible consequences, Lucien did not unfold the paper ball, and after a glance, he threw it into The trash can reaffirms the fundamental role of mathematics in arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a few minutes." The dull and dull voice just seemed to come from every corner of the room. However, Lucien saw a silhouette in the shadow between the curtain and the desk, which formed a gentle and elegant black-haired man. He looked at the past and thought that he was a young man in his twenties. He will think that he is over forty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-haired man sits on a lounge chair and concentrates on a book with a black hard cover. There seem to be countless feather pens in the subtle shadows around. The shadow is written and calculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Tom did not speak, waited for about ten minutes, the feather pen on the desk stopped, inserted into the pen holder like a regular feather pen. The shadow of the feather pen shadow disappeared completely. The dark-haired man, who might be Astar, closed the book and turned to look at the two: "Welcome to you, the new companion on the road of arcane and magic. I am Astar. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Astar." Lucine saw the cover of the book with a silvery white The lines form two words with special meaning: "Arcane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astall erected the book: "You have seen "Arcane" Journal?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The gentleman who told me the Magic Council once showed me a period of “Arcane” journals many years ago.” Lucien I can't suppress the curiosity in my heart. "Mr. Astar, can you let me see the contents of this issue of "Arcane"? This is the latest issue of "Olympic" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astar rises up from the lounge chair with a gentle smile: "You are studying the ancient magic system, I am afraid it is difficult to understand "Olympic The contents of the journal, but can't read the "Arcane" journal, and certainly can't understand the various new magic ideas in the "Magic" journal." He pointed to the other one on his desk. This book is a hard cover book with six stars. "However, you are the only magician who has asked me to watch the "Arcane" journal in the last ten years. Your study is very satisfying, so you can take a look, but Don't hold the hope of understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he handed the "Arcane" journal to Lucien, then looked at the ferry: "Tom, what should the magician call?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is Mr. Evans, a magician." When Tom faced Astar, Always a little restrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the "Arcane" journal and turned it to the catalogue page, and the expression on his face solidified, because the first article was: A complex variable function capable of describing and calculating the mental field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
