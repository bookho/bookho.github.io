			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muddy swamps are full of strange plants, some of which are like ordinary trees, the canopy covers the sun, but the roots are like humans. There are two legs full of blood-colored vines, drilled into the mud, I don't know where to go, there are many similar creatures, each of which adds countless secret colors to the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente hides behind a stone that is half a person high. The mud under the foot has a rare dry and strong area, and the nose is filled with stench. The smell of dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, he moved to sit on the ground, looking at the front with trepidation, above the black sludge, a python with a bucket full of buckets It is moving towards him, his eyes are like a candlestick, exuding unusual green light, and the horrible atmosphere makes all the swamp creatures around him far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with the body all the year round, Vicente is not timid recently, but his reason is hard to resist this extraordinary python The deterrent breath that comes out is the reaction of the body instinct. For ordinary people who are not even knight attendants and magic apprentices, they are simply unable to get rid of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legs are soft, trembling, the teeth creaking, and Vicente wants to turn around and escape, but he doesn’t even have the strength to stand up. Look at this python a little closer to yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, he has never been in the depths of the swamp for so long, often following the familiar roads, carefully looking for special plants nearby, and then immediately returning, and This time, he has lived here for five days, and the fruits picked along the road are almost finished, so naturally he also encountered one of the horrible creatures in the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black giant is close to Vicente, as if to prepare for today’s lunch, gradually, the distance is getting shorter and shorter, it is full of patterns and scales The strange skin, the stench in the mouth, was deeply imprinted into Vicente's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Vicente was desperate. The front part of the black giant cockroach suddenly rises up, the deep red tongue stretches with a circle of green streamer, and a pair of giant eyes stare at the mud behind the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, this black giant python turned and fled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente couldn’t believe this scene, this terrible python escaped like this? I haven't done anything myself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stayed for a long time, and Vicente’s gaze projected into the mud behind the stone. There was an idea in my heart: "Is it my magic book and the pale palm that scared the monster? But they are still in the mud!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he had a conjecture, perhaps the black giant python touched the "death of death". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, in its eyes, the stone has become a underworld or hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Vicente regained, he struggled to resist the urge to dig out a magic book. Walk along the secret path found by yourself to the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long day, he sneaked to the edge of the swamp, but there was no familiar mark on the trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so troublesome, the baron can't guarantee it?" Vicente thought with dismay, after all, before being out, he was caught and smashed. It is the standard evil behavior. Even if it is not a magician, it will be tied to a firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and decided to wait another five days, so he returned to the swamp and collected food along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Shirley is dead?" Baron Brunzer Looking at the night watchman in front of me, I am still in my dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night watchman has two big eyes, a wide forehead, and a mouthful of canine teeth. When he didn't talk, he gave a honest and honest impression. Once he spoke, his canine teeth were exposed, so he was very embarrassed, so he saw this look. Baron Brunzer is a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" painted a cross on the chest: "Yes, she died under the magic to keep the secrets of the evil wizard." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Brenzel kept the last reason. Taking advantage of the night watchman: "That is to say, Shirley did not say anything. That is to say, before she died, she was still a pure believer. You have no evidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger in his chest is burning, even if he is killed in front of the Kukes Gate, let the Grand Duke and all the nobles confirm this problem. The church watchman is crazy, and they must be curbed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" once again painted a cross: "The Lord told us that only the power of the devil can make her stand up to torture, confessing nothing, only The power of the devil will allow her to die before the confession, keeping the secret, so your daughter is undoubtedly tempted by the devil and smothered with the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Insane, really crazy..." Hearing the words of this strong word, Baron Brunzer has a feeling that the world is not real, so that he does not growl, does not refute, and does not attack. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" snorted: "Based on this, we have reason to suspect that you are colluding with the magician. You agree that Shirley is married to Vicente. The magician is proof that you are going to return to the referee with us. This is the will of the Lord and the command of the bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Brunsell The baron and the lady only felt that the sky was falling, and the miserable death of the only daughter was still digested in the future, and she actually met the crazy night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman swarmed up and grabbed the baron and the baroness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you let go, we are noble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are noble!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a villa in the city, Andrew and his two companions were stunned Listen to the report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? How could Shirley die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no evidence of them So, caught the baron couple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, they will be able to do this to us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Three people's face is very pale, the body involuntarily trembled, and their own waiting for Vicente's "obscenity" seems to lead to a monster that is more terrifying than the devil, that is a night watchman named pure faith! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, their bones are not as hard as their daughters." Interrogation The smile made people chilling out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are good results?" "The mad dog" asked urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator nodded: "A few years ago, when the Battle of Aalto was deadlocked, they secretly contacted a magician, but with the death of the Lord When the Pope was killed, they broke off the connection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, this shows that our method of fighting evil is very useful, dug out the baron The couple are the hidden fallen." "The mad dog" is very proud of the method of finding the evidence after he first arrested the person. He believes that he and the night watchman have the most devout faith, and can directly identify the fallen person without external evidence. Therefore, this style of work method is most suitable for yourself and others, of course, it is also easy to make a contribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator laughed and said: "I have long seen that the swaying aristocrats are not pleasing to the eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Hold their daughter's body on the firearm for a week to see if they can lead to Vicente." "The mad dog" smirked. "As for them, I think the hand of the prisoner can't wait." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew anxiously paces back and forth in the hall, waiting for Cook News from the side. His two companions sat on the sofa, and it was totally unacceptable for such a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young master, the news from the Kuks side, let the nobles remain restrained." The butler came in breathlessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may not see it before. But when the night watchman took the baron couple, they were horrified when they were angry, and even if all the nobles united, they could not withstand the church clergy and the night watchman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, the knock on the door suddenly sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" the butler asked in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will take my reward." "The mad dog" appeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew and others jumped up in shock: "You?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? ""The mad dog" has a sly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, this is the last paragraph." Andrew took out a purse full of Quintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" threw the money bag. I measured it a bit: "Yes, very sincere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he smiled and said: "This is a thank you very much, Mr. Andrew, you let We understood our strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned around, he left Andrew, standing in the same place, the open door breeze blowing, blowing Andrew is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Vicente once again sneaked out of the swamp. Still did not find the imprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something unexpected?" The more he wanted to worry, the more he decided to go back and have a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the night, he sneaked back to his own village, just as he planned to "kidnapped" a child to ask carefully, and suddenly heard two peasant women talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Miss Shirley is really pitiful, I don't believe she was lured by the devil..." under the propaganda of the church. Even if it is a peasant woman, she also knows how to use words that lure and degenerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Miss Shirley is more gentle and kind, just like an angel. It’s that damn Vicente cheated her, or she doesn't Will die in the referee, and also tied to the firearms..." Another peasant woman attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead, dead, Shirley is dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is like a giant hammer hitting Vicente’s brain, causing him to stun and almost fall out of hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next conversation between the peasant women made him understand the passing of the story, a face became pale, his eyes were lookless, swaying, not knowing There are other things to go back to the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the goddess of fortune blessed, he actually walked back to the depths of the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!" After a long time, a scream of heartbreaking screams in the swamp, which is more sorrowful than the lonely wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente's tears in his face, his eyes revealing the ultimate hateful spark, he slammed into the ground, his hands digging into the dirt, blood from the nails Exuded and stained red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, two black-skinned secret books and a pale palm appeared in the hands of Vicente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of his face has faded, leaving only numbness, despair, and resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really not?" "Mad Dog" secretly watching the fire The body on the shelf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The animal trainer" smiled and said: "This simple trap is easy to see through, and the magicians are very embarrassed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor girl, she is so attached to the feelings." "Mad dogs" spread the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firearms are only used to "purify" the living, so there is no burning of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
