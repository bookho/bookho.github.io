			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When approaching the Death Valley, Lucien and Natasha were a little afraid of their own eyes, and the valley in the dark was not described and rumored. The gloom of the gloom, the gray mist and entanglement, and the ghosts of the mournful ghosts crying, revealing an unspeakable calm, people can not bear to disturb this deepest and deepest sleep, and, far-sighted, still faintly able to see Glowing a holy light to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the Death Valley?" Natasha looked back at the cold and terrifying forest and confirmed that they were not in the wrong place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the forest, from time to time, the screams of frightening battles are heard, and the deceased servants of the demon lich are still searching for Lucien and Nata. The fall of Shakespeare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "This is the Death Valley. El seems to be really weird. I first sneaked into the investigation with the peek of the magic eye. Go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Lucien first took off the "The Ring of Congas" and applied Natasha and himself to a number of defense and alert spells. Then I took out the crystal ball and rubbed it for a few times, letting it spit out a black-sized meat mass of the size of the thumb, which was covered with deep folds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meatballs slammed open, revealing a pale but black-skinned corner of the eye, then splitting into nine, blending into the darkness and heading for the Death Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed Natasha and shunned in the cliff depression not far from the Death Valley, the world’s suppression of mental power Even the distance of the scouting magic of "Peeping the Eyes" has been shortened a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abnormal darkness in the crystal ball disappeared, and the sight of the glimpse of the magic eye was revealed. They were diving into the Death Valley from different angles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is?" Natasha pointed at the scene of a part of the crystal ball, where there is a two-meter-high ghoul-like creature Carefully entering the Death Valley, I did not pay attention to the peek of the eyes behind it, "Congens's servant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be, according to time In fact, they should also search for the woods, and Conggs is still in the main material world, unable to command them remotely, hey, it is a prisoner." Lucien frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn’t know Lucan’s understanding of all kinds of monsters, curiously asked: “The prisoner’s soul? It sounds amazing.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, very strange and very powerful kind of undead creature, don't be deceived by its ghoul-like appearance, what do you see under the rotten meat piece? Lu Xien is happy to explain, reminding her not to neglect this undead in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to see clearly, Natasha leaned on Lucien without any sorrow, breathing and smelling, making Lucien blushing and uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has three tiny but clear faces on the ribs of the abdomen, and the expression is full of pain." As the peeping eyes turn, Natasha finally looks To the front of the prisoner's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is pointing seriously to the abdomen of the prisoner: "This is the soul of the creature killed by it. It can imprison three, indicating that it is a mutation." The prisoner's soul is equivalent to the high-order. These souls bring enough energy to use the spell-like ability, which is equivalent to the warlock of the same order, good at the dead spirit and illusion, while the spell attacks it, the effect and some types of The damage will be transferred to these three souls. Before the three souls are destroyed, the prisoner is not affected, and is in a state of disabling the method."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this time directly with the physical attack type of magic can achieve a very good effect, for the Cavaliers, mainly do not confuse it with the ghoul, it is hurt by its spell-like soul. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s dimples on the cheeks: "It’s really weird, let the peek of the magic eye follow it and see what changes in the Death Valley." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Natasha does not say, Lucien will do the same, Where the eye of a spy quietly behind prisoners soul magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the valley of death, countless vines are dense, obscuring the stars, dark and dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien drives the glimpse of the devil's eye, but can command it as if it is sinking into the sea, without responding, and the nine peeping eyes seem to be completely integrated into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a soft glow on the crystal ball, the figure of the prisoner’s body emerges, it is fighting with an angel with a holy wing behind it, front It is the same bright field in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien found that nine peeping eyes had disappeared six, except for the one who followed the prisoner, only two passed. The dark area in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel? Where is this?" Natasha said in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly controlled the other two directions of change, bypassing the battle and going deep inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the prisoner is powerful, and it didn’t take long for him to kill the “angel”. He wanted to go deeper, but he was surrounded by more and more angels. There are even a lot of four-winged power angels and power angels, but this allows Lucien's peeping eyes to sneak into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene seen by the glimpse of the demon eye is slowly clear, and Natasha’s pale red lips open uncontrollably and tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a beach where the waves are gently stroking, and there are white souls on the beach. They are playing the harp with the instruments of the harp. Pleasant prayers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Same praise to the Supreme Lord, praise the omnipotent God of salvation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The whole beach is wrapped in holy light, as if it is in the light group, and in the far away of the beach, it is a city with twelve doors, the same length, width and height, with agate, jasper and so on. The gemstones are decorated, and on the top of the city, there seem to be six similar layers of gods. Four of them can see similar joy scenes. The top two layers cannot be seen clearly by the ability to spy on the magic eye. Both Lucien and Natasha can guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is the biggest trick! Who is copying the paradise mountain!" Natasha is not concerned about the content and theological knowledge of the textbook, so she can be Lucien was imperceptible and "friendly" with him, but this naked imitation behavior stimulated her devout faith and felt that the creator was full of infinite malice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000, it is an instant, and it is eternal..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of prayer came through the crystal ball. Lucien frowned slightly, and even the prayers and various rituals of the Holy Scriptures of the Shinrikyo were completely copied. What exactly does Francis want to do? Does he really want El to be the "God of High Imitation Edition"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say, it’s really creative... Lucien sighs and turns around and sees Natasha’s anger in her hands, which can be ruined by Lucien. In the midst of danger, the most important thing at the moment is to deal with the demigod lich, and does not allow himself to act according to his preferences, forcibly suppressing his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was moved, couldn’t help but extend his left hand, holding Natasha’s left hand without a sword, gently applying force to warm and comfort her. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha took a left-handed subconscious mind, but soon understood the meaning of Lucien, her eyes softly nodded, indicating that she had no problem, waiting for her hands The tremor slowly disappeared, and she took a little effort to pull out her left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before dancing and fleeing, the first time they were so hands-on, Natasha and Lucien were silently silent for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a white robe man with six pairs of illusory wings appeared on top of the angels, holding a sword and squatting into a black Hydra. The prisoner's spirit is firmly suppressed, and it seems that it will take a long time to kill this high-order undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Francis, is he?" Natasha knew that Francis followed El, but he could not think of him as a fake blazing angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly clarified his relationship: "I used to get information, transformed into the church of El, met Francis, he is proficient in theology, has been Inducing El in the direction of the God of Truth, this forged Heaven Mountain should also be his instigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
