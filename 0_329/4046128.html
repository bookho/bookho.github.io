			<div id="content">Br 谬 谬 滑稽 滑稽 滑稽 滑稽 滑稽 滑稽 滑稽Lying on the matter, but the nine "magic" is a real magic, and the cross of the cross, the cross pattern of the cross, and the sign of the truth, are becoming more and more confusing: "In the Before the sacred calendar, how did the truth gods be born and developed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up the thumb and fingers into a circle of shackles, Lucien In accordance with the method left by Muskilllin, first construct a strange logo with spiritual power, and then carefully explore into the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure light, the burning radiance, the innocent light, the whole interior is like the surging ocean of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the right method, Lucien left his own spiritual mark very smoothly, and he controlled the "曰之冕", but the five-layer seal Extremely complicated, Lucien could not resolve it by himself. He could only wait until he became a formal magician and cracked it according to Muskilllin's corresponding unblocking technique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed a magical power, with a unique atmosphere and a way of working, completely different from the magical power, is simply two extraordinary ways!" Lucien himself is practicing magic and has used the Holy Emblem of Truth, so there is enough judgment to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien hangs the "曰之冕" talisman on the chest and blocks it with clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the spiritual mark, Lucien’s feeling of being around the black and white gray world is so abstract, just like the previous death of a single-player character. Gray background, very peaceful and very cold and quiet, only the warmth conveyed by the shackles makes you feel like a living person, and these warmth can be spread out by yourself, this is the power of "excessive undead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, Lucien associates with the "eternal silence" that has repeatedly appeared in the notes several times, and is increasingly depressed and worried. Things seem to involve the most hidden secrets of the world, and seem to be associated with ancient legendary magicians, churches, and even the silver corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it that is sealed by the big cross frame?" Lucien fired a small flame on his finger to burn the parchment and notes. They have been included in the soul library. "The silver master uses 'eternal silence' as his own title. I am afraid it is not casually thought about. Is this manuscript leaking something that is done by the 'silver angle'? There is no small danger in my return. The danger that Master Maskillen predicted is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don’t return, then Wait an hour and then leave the road from the road leading to the magic garden when the lock begins to disintegrate. This hour has to be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wants to do, Leaving the hall, walked to the black room marked "No. 1" with a white number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the shelf for the utensils in the room, it is a row of transparent cabinets with a height of half a person. Their original colors are not visible in the black and white world. Now, it is extremely pale, and each item cabinet with different labels is engraved with different magic arrays. It seems that the way of preservation is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strange eyes immersed in black liquid, spider-like flowers blooming in the vacuum, floating dark gray stones, wrapped in shroud Dry corpse... Lucien didn’t have time to see what materials were there. According to the notes, I found the No. 72 storage box and put the moldy “grey” color powder into the corresponding container on the side shelf. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When using the gray-white spoon to sputum "platinicin", Lucien kept breathing, because according to the "Illustration" and "The Book of Astrology and Elements" It is recorded that the taste of this mycin can cause rot and mold from the internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the glass tube engraved with the magic array was brought out of the room, Lucien regained his breath and immediately felt how beautiful the world was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien went to other rooms and took a piece of stone-scale petrified snake feather, like the moon of the 'Shepherd' of the palm-sized silver moon. "Flower", in the end, took a baby-like face, each leaf of which has a different face, crying, complaining, sly, and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucien also analyzed the "Magic Gate" pharmacy when he was bored, how to compare and master the silver moon pharmacy that he has been preparing for his own use, and its difficulty is several times that of "Silver Moon Pharmacy"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an hour, even if there is enough material, Lucien doesn’t think he can refine the “Magic Gate” potion unless he gives himself a few days It is possible to experiment slowly with sufficient materials, and if the materials are not sufficient, it can only take more than half a year to thoroughly analyze and familiarize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the wide alchemy room, there are countless roads that are not known to Sean, and there are metal hands hanging in the air. The alchemy room comes back to the mysterious gray liquid of the cockroach. There is a large platform similar to the operating table. It is filled with all kinds of tentacles, black lines, pipes, etc. There are also several people with high black stoves... all of them have Jean Lucy. Enguang is a three-dimensional complex alchemy and magic array that looks dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to study the new alchemy installations. Lucien goes straight to the familiar alchemy platform and spends a few minutes figuring out what they do. Then start it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very complicated alchemy array is lit up. Lucien waits for half a minute after putting a tube of "euricin" into one of them. It has a fully transparent, skull-sized column with a thick layer of copper-colored gray liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a processed "green mold liquid". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same way, the "moon flower" and "petrochemical snake feather" were handled in the same way, and Lucien dropped the "Grimace" leaf into an alchemy array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless resentful things that appear in the alchemy array and cry out loud, like a little baby who has no toys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but their voices are all blocked by the defenses of the Alchemy Array, and there is no danger to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calmly looking at the grimace into a pale powder, Lucian nodded: "The legendary magician's alchemy room is good..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All materials are ready, Lucien faces the alchemy array with a blank expression, blending them all in one drop, matching the corresponding flame temperature, and then It is necessary to be distracted to construct a simple model with mental power at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, a black smoke rose, and the huge broken sound was eliminated by the alchemy platform. The semi-finished products in front of Lucien were completely turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first failure, the model of mental construction did not merge at precise time..." Lucien calmly summed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, Lucien looked at the gray liquid that was diffuse and floating in the air, frowning: "The second failure, the speed of the drop is a bit problematic." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Lucian focused on the silver ball that was smashed in the alchemy squad: "Analysis of small mistakes, The dose of Grimace was counted and the sixth failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After summarizing all the questions, Lucien once again entered the spell and focused on, calmly and steadily continue to try . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The everything in front was very smooth, and soon the final step was to add the moon flower powder to the grayish white liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiritually staggered the alchemy array, the powder sprinkled into the liquid in the most uniform way, while Lucien closed his eyes halfway, sensing the star of destiny, Stabilize the connection with the starburst, and then mix it with the powder to blend in with the power of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grayish white liquid fades a little bit gray, becomes pale, and gradually softens white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understood that at the crucial moment, the mental power quickly constructed an illusory weird symbol, and then slammed it into the soft white liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental power is like a pumping of a splitting headache, but Lucien did not retreat and shake a little, and stabilized the input of spiritual power with the power of the main star of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure white light suddenly blooms, without a little bit of ash, every drop of liquid in the transparent column is like a small moon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
