			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holm Light Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feili Bell, Baha'u'llah, and Shi Dong, who woke up from prayer, stood in the courtyard and stared at the paradise mountain projection of "falling" Looked at the night sky that turned into the ocean of milky white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God's Fall...The Pope's Majesty has used God's Fall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is the birth of the star a heresy? No, it is the evil wizard of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can run around the world like a real star... ...no wonder the Pope wants to use God's Falling..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three faces change in abundance, with awe, admiration, joy, doubt, confusion and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the incident of the Red Moon, the center of gravity of the Southern Church has once again shifted, and the main force has concentrated on searching the unknown space and at the same time The exploration of the black and white ash solidification shadow, therefore, the monk leader Valen Hill has returned to the holy city of Lance, Bahá'u'lláh is also about to return, leaving only Shi Dong led the Knights of the Knights in Zhalant, with the Philippines Liber and the Cardinal Defense Magic Council of the four parishes of Briana, Calais, Colette, and the North Coastal Corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, preparations for a two-year break with the Magic Council's comprehensive war plan, turned into a positive strategic defense situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Truth God, there is nothing more valuable and worthy of attention than finding the silver moon Etna and the mysterious existence of the injured fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they also believe that the Magic Council is the same, there will not be too much energy to do what is bad for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The glory of God is omnipresent, everywhere, pity the world, save the world." Philip Bell prayed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baha'u'llah painted a cross on his chest and sincerely praised: "The Pope is not the spokesperson of God, very decisive, change to be me." It will certainly hesitate for a long time, let the symbol of the evil magician continue to exist, continue to be seen by more people, and shake their faith in the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although there is no god-dropping technique, the Pope is still one of the strongest surpasses of the legendary half-step, still able to shock the existence of all enemies, but the god of the gods is the most powerful and closest to the god of truth. "If you can't use it within five years, it will definitely make a lot of enemies want to move. This has a considerable negative impact on the search for Silver Moon Aitna, so Bahá'u'lláh will say that he will hesitate for a long time. Make a decision in a quick time and let the foundation of the church be shaken even more violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, under the sacred and solemn horror of God, all the evil beings are gone, even if the Magic Council promotes the achievements of the artificial planet, It will only be ridiculed. Anything that attempts to step into the forbidden zone of God will surely feel the wrath of the gods. Besides the god of truth can create the world and create the planet. Even if others create it, it will not exist for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of dangerous thing, the sooner you hit it, the better." The Holy Knight Shi Dong very much agrees with the beheading, not to mention the role based on the belief. Just think of an artificial planet made by a magician in the sky that never stops, and he looks down on himself and waits for him to shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no concept of "air power" in this world, all the powerful who can fly understand the important surnames flying in battle, except for relics. In these indoor battle places of the church, even if the Knights are seriously injured, they can only play the standard of ordinary knights. They can also rely on their own flight ability to lively kill more than ten big knights without long-range means of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a near-orbiting planet that needs to be prepared for a period of time before it can be forced to fly, if equipped with powerful means of detection and attack, will It is a church nightmare! Is it necessary to always open the defensive circle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filibel has finished praying, his face seems to be aging a little, his expression is slightly exhausted and stunned: "This time it should be the Magic Council deliberately showing the artificial planet, otherwise We didn't find out so quickly that if these planets refine the magical array of invisibility, change, and even space jumping, things would be much more troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There must be a magical instrument or item that monitors the artificial planet, and feedback back to the information at the moment it strikes, so that it can be opened in time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stealing the Magic Council's information about the artificial planet program also creates similar products. Only the artificial planet in the near orbit can deal with another artificial planet in the fastest time. At the same time, should it be used without saying more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should also deploy a space transfer array in the near orbit so that the Holy Spirit priest and the holy knight can arrive in the shortest time without additional preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find the host of the artificial planet program and purify it under conditions, but I think this may not be great. The legendary magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several suggestions, listening to Stone's slight frown, this way of war seems to have a completely different change from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light of the white light, the crystal palace is as bright as the Inside the Duke of Foss, James and the Duke of Wolfburg, Russell, are standing quietly behind the floor-to-ceiling windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of God is so majestic, boundless, it is hard to create a rebellious heart, can only worship in awe." Bright head, face is fierce James looked at the "light of the ocean" that faded away, and the emotions sighed intricately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell, who is holding a glass of wine next to him, has lowered his head and stared at the bright red wine, seemingly afraid to look directly at the projection of Heaven Mountain: Since the church set foot on the stage of history, the gods descended only eight times, and six times accompanied by a strong man who stood at the peak of the world, the last governor of the Magic Council, the 'Star of Light', the legendary peak The magician 'death lord', the vampire prince Abel, the ancient time dragon Afflola, the evil god of the sun church, and the earth god 'God', only the god of silver moon Aitna and the Lord of hell, Ferrantes can receive The wounds are gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unexpectedly, this time, in the face of this newly born star, the pope actually used the gods down directly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The newly born star, hey, may not be..." James is the enlightened leader of the pro-magic parliament, more than Russell’s channel, before he heard about Douglas. The speaker is preparing for a huge plan, so I see the stars at Near the sky appear to see the church so intense reaction, he probably guess "the birth of stars," Douglas mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russell turned to look at James in surprise: "What, not a star?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe, I mean, maybe this is the artificial planet made by Lord Douglas, or why would there be a sudden birth of a star? I hope he will not fall under the gods..." James said with some excitement and a little worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Speaker of the Magic Council is degraded, it will be a fatal blow to the Parliament. Although there are big Arcanists such as Brooke, the Parliament cannot be destroyed, but each Organized, thoughtful Arcticians and legendary magicians will be difficult to suppress by the two arcane masters who dominated the storm and annihilated. Organizations with serious internal intrigues will undoubtedly gradually embark on the path of decline, which is not good news for the enlightened faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People, artificial planet?" Sky Knight Russell is a bit stuttering, no more than creating a semi-planet, which creates a planet similar to a small world directly in the main material world. - According to Douglas's theory, the current main material world is just a relatively large planet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James’s face is bright and dark under the light: “Yes! The Magic Council has more potential than our imagination, and it is even more dangerous. Maybe we will cooperate with us in the future. Become a 'God'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the truth forever..." Russell, who has a shallow faith, painted a cross on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you, you face the gods down?" Luciana asked in disbelief, the horror of God's martial arts every magician It is very clear, is the teacher already reaching the level of the god of love of the silver moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
