			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool radiance sprinkles over the many flowers that bloom in the small garden, giving them a sly beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked side by side with the Rhine on the garden path. After a brief silence, he asked directly: "Mr. Rhein, can you tell me where the Magic Council headquarters is? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where do you think it will be?" Rheinland, who has been faintly smiling, asked Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a reply: "I think it is deep in the dark mountains or on the other side of the mountain, because the church west ends early."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine snorted: "If you go to the dark mountains, you can only find those ancient sorcerers who are gloomy and crazy. Although they are powerful, many are high-order, even have Archmage, legendary magician, but a little bit different from their mind, you will become their experimental products, and then either gain uncontrollable power, or die of flesh and blood collapse. And the creatures of the dark mountains are not Mel. The beasts of the Black Forest and the low-level magical creatures can compare with your strength and survive no more than ten days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really dark mountains The remains of the ancient magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien affirmed his own guess: "Mr. Rhein, is the mainland magic parliament headquarters in a certain country? Belief in the northern sect, or believe in other gods ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An answer, in a country that believes in the Southern Truth. "Rheinland is thinking of something funny, shaking his head again and again. "You should have heard of its name, the Kingdom of Holm." The specific location is the floating city 'Aringe' near the capital of the Kingdom of the Kingdom, Lentaut. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge, the meaning of ‘sky’ in the ancient language of Ilvanus. "Lu Xien first used the surname to interpret the words, and then looked at the Rhine with surprise: "The Kingdom of Holm?" Rentait? Where does Natasha's mother come from? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this country is still in the faith of the god of truth! How did Vauriot’s grandfather visit the country?<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The love of Grand Duke of Vaolirit is not a story that has become a rumor across the continent? I sang and told several different things. "Rhein felt very funny and laughed. "But there is no poem. There is no single story to tell what evil forces are obstructing them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked questioningly: "Is it the mainland magic parliament?" Why is this strange situation happening? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's mouth smiles and looks at Lucien: "If you have learned the knowledge of domination, you will understand that this is a political issue in the mainland." Everything is balanced, the balance that the nobility needs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Balance? Lu Xien asked in an incomprehensible way, but he was thinking, "In fact, I have a lot of international political textbooks. Do you need to take a look?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that the Magic Council headquarters is not in a horrible and sinister place, Lucien relaxes a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rhein over Lussien half body, slowly walking forward: "When the Twilight War entered two hundred years, the strength and authority of the church reached its peak, whether it was the poor or the emperor, facing the pope Kneeling and kissing the tip of the god spokesperson. During that time, the church was free to abolish the Earl, the Marquis and the Duke, and even the Emperor of the Holy Heltz Empire. Therefore, no one dares to offend the majesty of the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, at the highest religious meeting, the church split into two factions, and there is support from the nobility behind it?" Lucien wakes up to see why the cardinals can follow the almost all nobles in the north.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein turned his head and looked at Lucien: "It's very sharp." Lucien, you are right. When some cardinals premeditated to overthrow the pope for reasons that everyone did not know, the nobility of their country joined the plot without any hesitation. However, these nobles deliberately leaked some news in advance, so that the Pope was prepared and not overthrown, so it developed into a situation of splitting between the North and the South. After all, for the aristocrats in the north, if this part of the cardinal overthrew the pope and controlled the church, their situation would not have changed in the past. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein smiled and shook his head: "Wrong, the strength of the northern church is very different from that of the southern church. It can be seen in the elves of the dark mountains, the dwarf countries, the countries that believe in other gods, the magical creatures in the dark mountains, and the remnants of magicians. I watched the church in the north being beaten. After they joined the game, they formed a situation in which the southern strong attack on the North was supported."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is different from the current situation. Now it seems to be the balance of power, and the northern fortress has been submerged." Lucien seriously thought, "So at that time the church split again? Holm Kingdom supports the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine slightly surprised: "I can think of this, Lucien, you are really good at learning and thinking. Yes, after seeing the great status and identity of the northern aristocracy, the southern aristocracy is in its own situation. There are also ideas, most of which choose to negotiate with the church, while the small part goes on the path of secretly cultivating the forces of magic, using their power to confront the church forces in their own kingdom. I am balancing in the middle to gain the right to speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This small part is the nobility of the four kingdoms across the Straits Strait, but they made a mistake, that is Unexpectedly, a great mage named Douglas actually changed the ancient magic system at this time, from simply imitating magical creatures to the path of studying the laws of the movement of nature. Under the leadership of Douglas, the strength of the magic council is With the growth of geometric progression, powerful magicians and legendary magicians are constantly appearing. After integrating several hidden magic organizations more than 100 years ago, the mainland magic parliament has expanded into the second largest force in the whole world."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a change that Holm and other four kingdom nobles began to support when they did not think of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucien heard the familiar name: "Mr. Douglas? I know him." Lucien didn't ask if Douglas was still alive, because a magician like him is sure to have countless delays. The method of lifespan is not a problem for a few thousand years. For example, the "Litch Transformation Ceremony" recorded in Lucian's "The Book of Astrology and Elements" can be carried out after becoming a high-level magician. Once successful, life expectancy It will be extended to at least 1,500 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Douglas is one of the top ten strong players in the world, the first great arcian, the president of the mainland magic parliament, "Arcane" The founder of the journal." Even Rhein, the man who is mysterious to the extreme, has a faint awe when he mentions Douglas. "So now it is a situation in which several forces balance and the nobility benefits from it. Oh, in Holm, The magician is already a semi-public identity. Although the church is quite large and concentrated there, it has been suppressed very badly. If it was not helped by the nobility, it was already uprooted by the Magic Council."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is probably aware of the current situation: "So the church allowed the nobles of this class to visit the Kingdom of Holm, it seems hope The aristocratic forces of the Holm Kingdom have been pulled over. Oh, the Grand Duke of Ouolite is 'complete'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dagong himself never thought about it. In this way, the western and southern countries of the continent and The aristocrats of the St. Heilz Empire are known as the most extreme and conservative pro-church, and you can imagine the sensation of the marriage at the time. Although most of the aristocrats of the Holm Kingdom understand the situation on the mainland, they will definitely choose allegiance. Their own lords, this is not because they have noble character, but because if the nobles can not unite in accordance with the most basic rules of loyalty to the lord, they have long been swallowed up by the two powerful forces of the Magic Council and the Church. How can it be They are doing a dangerous balance." Rhein smiled ironically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he made a downward pressure gesture: "Okay, complicated things do not need to know your strength, what you need to consider now is how to go to Huo The matter of the kingdom of the country. The Stormwind Strait has been blocked by the church, and only the allowed aristocrats and businessmen can go there, and the inspection is extremely strict. Of course, you can also cross the north-south church confrontation and then cross the Shahran Empire to the north. The only problem with the northern part of the country going north to the Holm Kingdom is that the church’s confrontational zone is more restrictive than the stormy strait blockade, and even the nobility and big businessmen cannot pass.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Magic Council should have its own path?" Lucien thought of the gentleman from the Magic Council headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing Lu Xien can not rely on Natasha, even if her grandfather is the king of Holm Kingdom. Because the obstruction of her parents was the power of the magical parliament, and she was a devout believer in the truth, telling her the identity of her magic apprentice, plus the previous deception, is likely to be directly killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein nodded: "The Pearl of the Sea 'Stuart' has a liaison with the Magic Council, but I don't know who it is, you need to find it yourself, And even then, it is dangerous to steal the blockade, so I said that you can only go to the official magician with a good self-protection strength. Of course, if you can become a middle magician and learn to fly, You don't have to worry about it. The sea is so wide that the church can block the ship but it is impossible to completely block the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
