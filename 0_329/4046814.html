			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan Fort. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the meteor crossed the sky, as the rain poured, when it was to Aringe, the northern church in the cathedral, Pope Bilkovsky, though I didn’t see anything, but my heart was inductive. Looking up at the beautifully embossed ceiling, I said to myself: “Wicken is doing it? Are they ready to capture the artificial planet?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp He and the members of the Cardinal Mission of the Northern Church have already set a plan to smash the timing of the Southern Church’s capture of the Magical Parliament’s artificial planet, and even “plan” one, and even plan to promote the matter behind the scenes. In the absence of the Southern Church, the church will be slow to give up space to the artificial planet. However, when things really happened, he did not move, and even the members of the saints and other cardinal groups did not call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the actions of the Southern Church are too crisp and neat, the Magic Council has no response at all, and naturally there is no comprehensive melee they imagined. After jumping to the track through the pre-arranged transmission array, only the backs of the members of the Southern Church Cardinal Mission can be seen, the rescue of the Magic Council is delayed, and then the anger of the Magic Council is replaced by the Southern Church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is not good enough to bear the crime for others, who would be willing to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Magic Council is not really unresponsive? Viken is stronger and doesn't dare to stay outside of Lance for a long time. How can it be suppressed? So many legendary peaks and arcanists?” Berkovsky frowned slightly and noticed a slight anomaly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, it’s not that Viken should attack Allinge, dragging a few legendary peaks and some Arcanists, but it’s hard to stop all, by a few Arcanes. Carrying other legendary magicians into orbit and fighting with members of the cardinal group such as Melmos. Although they are slower than half a beat, they can't stop the Southern Church from taking the artificial planet, but they will also happen to themselves. Looking forward to the scuffle, but who knows that the current sky has no movement! What about the Arcane Architects of the Magic Council? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Arcane Masters, other legends will not be projected by the artificial planet, because they have a two-level rank difference with Melmos, belonging to the The crushed object, if Melmos still carries the "purification of the cross", then it is very likely that it will really fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy-like magic works in an instant, because things are going on, and no one tries to interfere with and hide the trajectory of fate, so Berkovsky immediately understands The current situation, the "abyss will" madman actually came to the north without warning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working with Wicken?" Berkovsky is as funny as hearing "the death notice of his own", turning the idea that he will not believe at all. There is only one way to cooperate with the "Abyss Will". That is to arrange a ritual that summons and is enough to open the barriers of the plane. Then there is an enemy that needs to be dealt with in the vicinity of the ceremony, and then it will kill people very hard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Berkovsky would rather believe that Viken has used the "absence of the abyss will", but how is it summoned? It takes a great price to let a kind of god that does not belong to the main material plane, but there is no sign before this time, and there is no such thing as "surface heaven" as a surface cover...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bekowski thinks about Wicken’s approach to avoid being dealt with in the future. Suddenly, his “heart of faith” has once again produced a glimpse of wonder, and the miracle--a hunch Flashed to the window and looked up at the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloomy afternoon of winter, there seems to be a bright light flashing through the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may not be aware of it, but Berkovsky is the most powerful legendary peak. Naturally, there is no difficulty. He narrowed his eyes:" The artificial planet blew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the power reached the legendary level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southern Church Didn't they be so stupid? Are they not so stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly was a bit lucky, but fortunately, he didn't do it. Otherwise Not to mention the effort, but also exposed the intention, offended the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all the interests of the cooperation are the most important, but the Magic Council will still "return". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar ideas on them The magical items are stressed and then flooded by energy storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Hathaway's fission reactors are mainly from the reverse cracking of the "atomic fission" magic and their own research on fission reactions. The role played by it is not detailed enough, far from the stage of smooth utilization. In the words of Lucien, the core of their fission reactor is an atomic bomb, and then relying on magic to let the energy release smoothly, so it will always run out of control. The situation, so it can produce a legendary level of explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "purification of the cross" eliminates the magical array outside, the magical effect of the isolation reaction disappears, and the "failed reactor" of the artificial planet begins to work. At this time, the elimination effect can go deep into the core, and it is difficult to eliminate the magic array of the reactor inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fission reaction officially begins, it is a natural process, not an extraordinary force, so it cannot be eliminated, and the magical matrix that can be eliminated is those that let energy Release the part that is smooth and easy to use, so the explosion after the loss of control is more thorough and more powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glare of the light swept the surrounding with awesome energy, the artificial planet at the core was completely vaporized, and various tough "curses" raged in This area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light subsides, the members of the cardinal group such as Melmos and Philip re-emerge, and some of them are covered in the "Sacred House". Some have six white wings behind them to wrap the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos in the forefront holds the "Sacred Avengers" sword in both hands, and the whole body is entwined with light, and the invisible curse is eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, it’s not eternal blazing blah..." He whispered to Philip and other humanities, and he couldn’t hear the emotions in his tone. Don't care, although it doesn't seem to be harmful, the consequences will not be easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "atomic fission" can be based on the caster level or the amount of cast material, Reaching the legendary third-order level, but the magical array and casting materials that the artificial planet can carry are limited, so it can only play the legendary first-order level, and it will not hurt the legendary epic knight of Melmos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that Melmos is not afraid, if the out-of-control explosion is the "eternal blaze" that he has experienced before, he will recover from that injury. In the near future, I am afraid that I will be seriously injured again, and I may even be unable to make up for the hidden danger caused by continuous serious injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly hair behind him is messy and quite embarrassing. If it wasn’t for Melmos to stop it, I’m afraid it’s been badly hit. He’s angry and incredible: "Why is the magic array being <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' purifying the cross, but will blew itself after it is eliminated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he? I can't figure this out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t eliminate the “purification of the cross”, forcing the magical array around the artificial planet and dragging it back will take more time and increase the chance to meet the legendary magician. The possibility, however, has used this "purification of the cross" but this kind of incredible situation has appeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe there is a legendary magic seal, the legendary magic that has taken place, so after you remove the seal, it naturally breaks out." Melmos according to himself The experience is speculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible, this is the legendary level of magic, the artificial planet is not a legendary item, and under the effect of elimination, no matter the beginning, all the extraordinary power will Was eliminated." Philip swayed his head in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" In their similarly connected magical channels, St. Katie’s voice screamed seriously: "Don’t worry about why it happened, currently the most The important thing is what should we do next, continue to capture the nearby artificial planet, or directly evacuate? Time is tight, I don't want to fight with the Arcanists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;They chose this artificial planet because there is an alternative destination in the vicinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
