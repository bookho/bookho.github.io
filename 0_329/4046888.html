			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken laughs without any disguise, the two cardinals outside the study face each other, do not understand why the live broadcast of the Magic Council will make the Pope The smile is so exaggerated. After Douglas became a god, his head suddenly broke down. In the live broadcast, he publicly announced his surrender to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides this kind of thing, they really can't think of the live broadcast of the Magic Council to make the Pope happy, not angry. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they also clearly understand that this is absolutely impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few laughs, Viken returned to calm and converged his expression. After all, this was an experiment done by Douglas. The result could not be 100% believed, in case He was deliberate Deceive yourself? Still wait for yourself to repeat several times and confirm the truth before considering the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experimental design is not complicated. The difficulty lies in the subtle control and production. This pair is also a kind of god, has a profound alchemy foundation, and has long-term concern and It is not too complicated for Pope Wicken to learn arcane. The biggest difference between him and the Arcane Master is not the ability to do it, but the way of thinking that the Arcane system cultivates, so He can't design such an experiment. It can only rely on the research progress of Douglas, Lucien and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square, as Douglas repeats the experiment, a voice It is impossible to "sound up and hear, the long-term listening to the "voice of mystery" and the "sky TV" ordinary people are more or less popularized with the most obvious arcane common sense and logic basis, this "reverse decision process "Things" may not make them feel amazed, and this completely contradicts the experience summed up in their usual life and the instinct of being a smart creature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the confirmation of the results of the experiment, they gradually calmed down the panic. After all, magic is beyond their imagination, and they are equally ridiculous in their hearts, so Now that the "causal law" has been destroyed, it has not completely subverted their three views. Anyway, their three views have long been destroyed under magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Magic is amazing!" said an elderly gentleman excitedly, "It can prolong life, slow down aging, and reverse the past!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one next to him happened to pass by, so the magician who watched the live broadcast in this square looked at him sadly, can these three be juxtaposed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician’s head is swollen and his eyes are congested. He only feels that his understanding of the world, his understanding of life, and his understanding of value have all been subverted. The world becomes illusory, life becomes illusory, and value becomes illusory. Anyway, the current decision will change the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, magicians had this concept, the past is unchanged, the future is uncertain, and now, even the past will change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His ears creaked, and there seemed to be a thunder roaring, turning his head around to make sure he was not in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another veteran wearing a soft hat is equally excited: "Yeah, magic is amazing, I heard that high-level magicians can take their lives." Extending for hundreds of thousands of years, you can still maintain youthful vitality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They’s attention to this aspect seems to be stronger than "now changing the past" which is almost a nightmare Experimental results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of bards and playwrights around the world were excited and distorted after the panic, so the experimental results of "magic" gave their creation inspiration. Can't wait to weave a wonderful and shocking story, such as a person killed by a "strong observer", all traces of his past will be erased, replaced by other characters or things, so no one remembers He, no one knows that there has been such a person in the world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more they want to be more excited, some simply kneel down and take out the carry-on Simple pens or pens record their inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is foreseeable that in the future, the speciality of the micro-field will support a group of drama writers and bards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their "simple pleasure," the students in the general school and the aristocratic school are much more painful, and the experiment by the Speaker of the House and the Evans himself. Overthrowing their most basic common sense, contrary to their most basic logic, they hold their heads, have a splitting headache, one side is the normal world, the knowledge of ordinary learning, and the other is the incredible world that the experiment just showed, both Like angels and demons, they fought fiercely in their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, why should I see the experiment that Evans participated in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this looking for death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali stupidly thought: "Is it true now? Is every thought changing the past?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, there must be other explanations, this is not, there is no mathematical basis to describe..." Langman tried to calm himself, but could not stop the mutter in his mouth. Self-speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their "painful awkwardness", the magic apprentices and arcane masters are dead and quiet, and even the breathing is gone, people are onlookers. Worried, they will burst into their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the live room, Douglas repeated the experiment and got the same result, but he did not stop, but continued mechanically, with no expression on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Lucien coughed twice, he sighed and stopped the experiment, solemnly saying to all "audiences": "I think arcane The basic idea of ​​the division should be to respect the experiment and respect the phenomenon. Everything is subject to them and mathematics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is equivalent to what is being announced, Samantha, Louise and other Arcane masters who participated in the live broadcast seem to be unable to support the body suddenly, sitting softly on the ground, just like their past knowledge, common sense and instinct can no longer support their worldview, Outlook on life and values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge, Lentarte, wherever the live broadcast can be seen, the arcaneists have done this more or less. In particular, a magician who is good at the astral is crying silently, as if mourning the determinism that has passed away and the "causal law" that may be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, determinism has come to the brink of bankruptcy step by step, but they still refuse to admit it until they encounter the powerful and subversive shock of the present. Formal reality, becoming fragile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indescribable sadness, envy, confusion, and despair shrouded the Sky City and the major magic parliamentary divisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looks around the live room, seeing a few legendary wizards like Brooke, Fernando, and other people thinking about the problem in a dignified manner, other arcanes are exposed to fragility. The expression, then thought: "The most important thing for us now is to figure out why this result occurs. We must know that microscopic particles are substances that can be diffused anywhere. Maybe we can explain them from other directions instead of forcing them. I believe that I can change the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words reinjected a "vigor" into an impacted Arcane division, allowing them to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the broadcast ended, watching Samantha and other arcanes leave with sadness, Douglas sighed slightly: "No matter what, they should face up to determinism The problem, the era of great development of Arcane, in addition to glory, glory, joy, excitement, excitement and other words, will be accompanied by negative words such as sadness, pain, despair, this is an era full of smiles and tears." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after today, if the theory does not break through the surname, the majority of the parliament’s strength will be stagnant for at least ten years, and the basic concept will be directly subverted. Knowing the instability of the world.” Brooke, who had experience of breaking and solidifying, walked over with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s eyes staring at the experimental device, still poisonously said: “Now the stagnation is lagging behind in the future, then even life will be stagnant. At present we have a The gods, the four legendary peaks, can shelter them from reshaping the three views."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹬蹬瞪's footsteps sound, Annick, S The students of Lucien and Heidi and other students came to the live broadcast. After watching the experiment, they couldn’t control themselves and couldn’t wait to ask the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Douglas smiled bitterly: "These two thought experiments are all proposed by Evans, so after this live broadcast, I want to be absolutely big. Some arcane masters, magic apprentices, and ordinary people with basic arcane common sense will be scared when you mention them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am notorious... Lu Xi'en squatted on his chin and smiled helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
