			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the Allinge Division of the Song of the Silver Moon League, the Arcanists expressed their feelings and praised and shocked the basic composition of the microscopic domain. No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember that Lord Heinrich once said that the essence of arcane is simple and intuitive, and the beauty of arcane comes from strict determinism and worship. Symmetry, although the intuition has been negated by Levski geometry, Evans geometry, general relativity and matrix mechanics, the strict determinism is gradually confirmed by the wave function probabilistic interpretation and uncertainty principle in the experiment, but simple And symmetry still seems to rule the 'our world, so the Brooke equation is known as the goddess' poetry, and the qualitative formula and the Lucian equation are also praised as having the ultimate beauty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arcane master said as if he was speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinris is a legendary magician of Parliament one or two hundred years ago. He has made outstanding contributions in the field of arcane and magic, and has won many fields. The highest honors, such as the current formulas of many force fields and astrology changes, are his achievements. Without any surprise, he is likely to become a great arcian. Unfortunately, he met a saint of the Southern Church in an exploration of the ruins, both falling and falling. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uris settled the journal in his hand and smiled and said: "So, according to symmetry, both nucleons and electrons should have corresponding antiparticles present, microscopic The types of particles are not as small as we think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is normal, there are nights in the daytime, the existence of positive and negative particles is in line with the scope of philosophy, no Reduce the simple beauty of basic particle types," another archer said with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian nodded and deliberately said: "Of course, it's just a simple type, and the microscopic particle intrinsic properties are not at all simple."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this sentence, all the arcane masters on the scene changed their expressions, some smile, some helpless, some annoyed, some sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the wave-particle duality has not yet been unanimously recognized, it has basically become the mainstream explanation, and it is understood by most arcane masters. Probability interpretation is deeply challenging their nerves and souls. It seems that the whole world will become illusory and unreal at any time. It also becomes illusory and unreal, and the electronic double-slit interference experiment, quantum superposition state and the resulting " The observer effect is that they have to choose an attitude of escaping, as if they think about the problem will burst their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Yurisian, I will leave first, and many problems in quantum field theory make me every cell are calling for careful reading." An Arcanist Put away the expression of bitter smile and leave it by using quantum field theory as an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uris Ann laughed: "I hope that your research will bring inspiration to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hope it." The arcist smiled stiffly and answered that he could hardly understand even the paper. How can you give inspiration to you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I spent a year or two carefully studying it, I still hope to understand the quantum on this Arcane by the foundation of my fifth-level Arcanist. Field theory, in the journals and many high-level Arcans and Arcanists exchange discussions. But this is also a matter of one or two years, when the quantum field theory may develop to the extent that it is incomprehensible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is increasingly feeling the gap between his own level and the most cutting-edge areas of the micro world. If there are no unexpected situations and better teaching and desperate research, the gap is almost Inevitably getting bigger and bigger, until I can only learn the papers of others a few years ago, slowly follow the tail of the times, and even be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is not afraid of this because he sees from the journals such as "Arcane", "Magic", "Nature", "Element" and "Electromagnetic". There are no more than one hundred or so arcane teachers who can really discuss and study the most cutting-edge fields in the micro world. The rest can only use experiments to add evidence and opposite examples to their theories. That is to say, talents such as themselves are the mainstream of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, the times have always been led by very few people, especially in the field of arcane. Most of our arcane masters can digest their research. The result will be fine." The arcane teacher shook his head and gave up the idea of ​​self-consolation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentat Third General School, which is in the first two general schools, and the students’ performance in daily life is affected by Lenta Under the general approval of the general public, the third general school jointly run by the Holm Kingdom and the Magic Council - since the first students have not graduated from the fifth year of graduation, the real effect remains to be considered, so the general school is not currently The promotion of major cities is only gradually established in the city of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn Rantart, the city of Pisa Mara is much colder." He first experienced this coldness - the small town of Samara was located on the south side of a mountain, and the cold air from the north was blocked by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, Ali had to wait for the June Uniform Entrance Examination to enter the General School. Before, he had to pay for the "prep" jointly organized by various scholars and magic apprentices. "But the establishment of the third general school gave him the opportunity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increase in the number of magic apprentices, many tasks that were not completed in the past were also " Rejuvenating youth, and the influx of many workers into Rentat, the third general school was built half a year earlier than the original, and the Rentant City Hall, which was financially difficult to expand the city of Rentatt, would not want to see the new school directly ruined. Half a year, so a special unified examination was held in advance, and the first-year students were recruited in the new year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Grandpa Short, do you have my letter?" Ali stopped at the school gate and asked the muscular white hair old man, who is said to be a The high-ranking knight attendant who was injured and retired against the demon-infected creatures was recommended by the Queen's Armed Forces Protection Association to the third general school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short shook his head: "Ali, there is no letter today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you You, Grandpa Short." Ali turned and left in disappointment. After coming to Rentatt, he felt a little inferior in his heart. He did not write a short letter to the pen-pals until he was admitted to the third general school. His life was stabilized. Rewriting the letter told her about her current situation and the new address, and then waited day after day for a reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the classroom, the warm air rushed in, the cold suddenly melted, and Ali felt more comfortable than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it's just a classroom, there are vents for magical air conditioning, and it doesn't know how many times warmer than a fireplace." Ali found himself more and more like Rantart's Lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Professor Brian, who taught the "Basic Arcane Theory" class, came in and tapped the table to indicate that everyone was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is a smiling middle-aged man who is said to be a student of Douglas Magic School, a high-level magic apprentice, usually part-time "basic arcane theory" "To complete the task, earn an Arcane point." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone worked very hard, and they were all ten minutes away from the first class." Brian smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current general education school, there is no child who does not want to study and study, so the enthusiasm is self-evident - the school has the right to expel any violation Students with more than three school rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brian, why are you coming so early?" Ali knew that Brian was approachable, so he asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian smiled and said: "I am here to announce a good news for you. The proposal of the Rantart City Council Board of Education has been approved by the Parliamentary Affairs Committee. The top 20 of the next month’s monthly exam will be invited to visit Allinge.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Aringe? Sky City, Parliament Headquarters?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you really visit the City of the Sky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it is possible to visit the atom Research Institute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are boiling, and under the propaganda of mystery and various newspapers, the names of Allinge and the Institute of Atomic Research have been deeply They have implanted their hearts, and at this time they have heard the opportunity to visit. How can they not be excited and not excited? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was alone at his young age, he also managed to live alone, but he also controlled the emotions, clenched his fists, and countless scenes appeared in his mind. I also have the opportunity to go to the City of the Sky. I also have the opportunity to see the world-famous Atomic Research Institute? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you can visit the City of the Sky, visit the Allinge Magic Tower, talk to the Alchemist Life Prosper, or visit the Genetics Laboratory, Life. The Substance Synthesis Laboratory, the Psychological Research Center, the Arcane Library, and..." Brian paused with a smile, "and the Institute of Atomic Research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
