			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This paper is based on the principle of relative surname and the principle of constant speed of light. For this, I stipulate as follows..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sweeping the contents of this paper, Douglas smiled serious and looked up at Oliver, but slightly found the pile of paper in front of him, including love poems, scripts and papers. The paper inside is instantly turned into dust and dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver did not grab the first page of Douglas’s paper, but in a hurry he directly ruined everything on the table and completed a clean and ruin Destroy!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is full of anger at this moment, this time he has fallen into a vortex of emotions, a little embarrassed, after taking the paper out of research, he forgot to take back and began a long love poem The creation, later, simply forgot about this matter, and introduced Douglas to his study without doing anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should give myself a "mechanized mind" when Taling notices! Oliver's facial muscles twitched and he regretted it very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at Oliver strangely: "Why ruin it? Why stop me? Lucien's paper is based on two premise to derive the formula." What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main page of the thesis consists of two principles and their respective elaborations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver looked sideways at the bookshelf on the wall, smiled self-deprecatingly, and then vividly said: "This is some of my ideas for communicating with Lucien." Still in the stage of hypothesis and fantasy, full of loopholes and errors, so I don't want to be seen by others. You know, I am a perfectionist, whether it is script, poetry, oil painting, or arcane and magic. Research, as long as I am not satisfied, I would rather ruin it, and I will not take it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it is ridiculous to say that others are ridiculous, but he is overflowing. The great arcane master with a strong artist's breath, with the unsharp and sorrowful shape, is exceptionally convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas seems to be a bit convinced, with a smile: "Fantasy and assumptions are also very good, can give me inspiration, let me guess what you are discussing, grace, speed of light Unchanged... Recently popular papers explaining the speed of light experiment... Difficult road Sean is based on these two premises, naturally derived your transformation equations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver hold his forehead, the Speaker of the House, do you want to be so smart: "No, not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas does not seem to hear what he said, I took out a stack of papers from the storage bag and lifted the feather pen. I started the deduction based on the two premise assumptions of the Lucian paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Oliver stepped forward and stopped, but he saw Douglas’s eagerness to read the book. He suddenly silenced, and the Speaker of the Lord had this. The idea, even if he can stop it for the time being, can be deduced as soon as he returns. It is better to look at it and see if he can seize the opportunity to guide him, so as not to cause a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything is untenable...Imagine here, Oliver will start the magic tower's most privileged authority, and strive to jump out of the "Destruction Theater" at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-face is destroyed, and the top is multiple injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Oliver was a little responsible, did not inform Fernando and Lucien to come, lest they be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these two premises, and with the direction, Douglas quickly derived a series of formulas, but the more deduced, the slower he dropped the pen . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡...The Destruction Theater outside the Magic Tower made a low-pitched voice, and the star of the explosion seemed to be slightly deflected by the force of the force, although it was not Perfect, very rudimentary, but it exudes a more horrible destruction than the previous one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s forehead has a cold sweat, and it’s the strongest of the legendary peaks. It can trigger the change of stars in the half-plane that he is completely in control. What is the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One magic blessing on the body, Oliver all emotions are excluded, the blue eyes under the gold-rimmed glasses are like frozen ice, staring at Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stroke of the feather pen, Douglas silently looked at the paper, the face of Cihe was extremely gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord the Speaker?" Oliver whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas stone-like still, no answer, just as Oliver was preparing to re-sound, he raised his head and revealed a bitter smile: "Although building electromagnetics in Brooke After the system, I realized that my theory of motion seems to be a bit problematic at high speeds, but seeing them being relentlessly overthrown and subverted is still quite a blow. There is a feeling that life has been completely negated in the past thousand years." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is just a useful supplement to your theoretical system." As a famous artist and playboy, Oliver did not have any heart and eyes to say swear words, " Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a long time, and the Speaker of the House did not seem to burst his head, nor did he know that the world was broken and solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without comforting me, what I have derived is what I know very well, Lucien, Lucien, he is more dangerous than Brooke..." Douglas Smiled and shook his head. "Fernando really worked hard to accept him as a student. Fortunately, I didn't fight for it at the beginning... Fortunately, this paper is only assuming that the surname is derived, and there are no experiments and phenomena confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Moreover, its time error with the artificial planet is completely out of date. According to this derivation, it should be slower, but it is actually faster..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s invisible spirit, a little addicted to himself: “What is space, what is time, why they change with matter, why is speed? The function..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver was a little surprised, it seems that Douglas’s speaker did not notice the discussion of the surname article published by Lucien students, so that’s fine. ! When he adapts to the familiar "why the world", it will not be so shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the tone, Oliver stated his point: "In the past, we thought that time and space were absolute, reading, and mathematical, but now maybe Try to look at it from another angle. If you can study the mystery of time and space, I think it is not far from the reality of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He It is to tempted Douglas, a magician who wants to prosper in the future, to hope that he will find out the relativistic effect, not just thinking that the original system was overthrown, but thinking that it is closer to reality, so as to avoid headshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas woke up from indulging, licked his forehead, and took care of the bow tie of the chest. The voice was erratic: "In just a hundred years, I I have accepted several subversive surnames in a row. If I didn’t suddenly think of the relative truth and the concept of absolute truth mentioned by Lucien, perhaps I would also like Broak, the cognitive world is broken and solidified, although this paper has not yet been tested. The results and phenomena confirmed, but in the battle of high-speed sports, I have some problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver touched his forehead and thanked Lucien for doing one. A good thing, let the Speaker of the Lord accept the difference between relative truth and absolute truth. He solemnly said: "Lushine said that your movement system is not wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well? Not wrong?" Douglas looked at Oliver in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver nodded seriously: "He said that your movement system is relative truth, it is an approximation of this theory at low speed, and your path is not wrong. It’s just not far enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a playwright, it’s very easy and simple for him to create a “celebrity quote,” but Lucien I have indeed done the description of "low speed approximation". As for the others, of course, it is the "adjective" that modifies the surname! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas first nodded slowly, accepted this statement, and then frowned: "Listen to your tone, it seems that there have been preliminary experiments confirmed?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver’s expression suddenly solidified on his face, dealing with such a person as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and he would be seen if he was not careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, just Lucien, he has a lot of confidence, you know, his previous success has made him full of confidence." Oliver continued to lie and pushed the problem to Lu Xien, he did not hesitate to describe him as a arrogant mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
