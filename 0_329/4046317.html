			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness is boundless and empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Lussian looked around in sorrow, and there was an inexplicable force in his heart that shouted something that was hard to hear, causing the darkness to tumbling. It is like a low depression before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a dark green vine rises from the foot of Lucien, rushing toward his body, and the dark red thorns screaming, It seems to be covered with dry blood, exuding the sweet smell that can paralyze the human body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fascinating vine speed is so fast that it doesn't give way to the passage of Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien struggled hard and wanted to use magic, but found that the mental power was completely dry, and there was no trace of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp dark red thorns plunged into Lucien’s body, and the intense pain and soft numbness spread throughout the body, making him unable to resist like El Weiss screamed like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this severe pain, the darkness begins to break, and the light shines in, bright and glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s head was groggy, and the light in front of him made his eyes unable to stand up, but he immediately remembered that he was suddenly scarlet. Many negative states of the magic tree hit the ray, and even the time to stimulate the "dashing boots" to jump away did not faint and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rows of dense, dark-eyed eyes come to mind, and Lucien subconsciously motivates himself to build a "short-distance teleport" within the soul, ready Avoid the follow-up attacks of the Scarlet Tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the "element vortex" used before going to sleep to help yourself wake up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vine attack in the dark is subconscious, forcing yourself to wake up as soon as possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "short-range teleport" was fired, Lucien found that the mental power was as dry as the dream, like a river with a silt at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the sequela of the use of the 'elemental vortex'!" Lucine's heart flashed through the enlightenment, and then both hands forced to evade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become the second-level knight's own use of the "element vortex" and will not be as severe as the previous life, and even people need help! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just tumbling, Lucien only felt the body vacant, and the eyes that adapted to the light suddenly saw that it was a small room with a white wall ash. Where is the dark green and the dark red coexisting vines, how can there be a huge, evil scarlet tree, how can there be two rows of dark eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien fell to the ground and made a dull voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s body is thick and fleshy, and Lun’s did not feel pain, and he took time to look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is small, except for a wooden bed, there is only one open wooden box, which is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so clean, so simple, it’s like a single cell.” Lucien said suspiciously in his heart, “Where is this? Why am I here? "I won't cross it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an experience that Lucine couldn’t help but think that he had been lost by the scarlet tree trunk, but it’s been One of the secrets of Lucien’s deepest heart, so even if he was surprised, he did not blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise your hands, see the familiar slender and powerful appearance, touch the neck, feel the summoning mark, Lucien finally confirmed that he did not cross, nor died , and the body, or Lu Xien? The body of Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This didn’t let Lucien relax, because there were two black bracelets on his hands, they exude a fascinating glow, and the neck On the basis of the touch of Lucien's hands and the skin's induction, there is also a close collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the strange patterns and shapes of the black bracelets, and the needle-like things that they plunged into the blood vessels, Lucien’s face was severely judged: “This is a banned bracelet that can hold the blood. The roots should be banned. Collar, it’s no wonder that my mental strength is better than using the 'Elemental Swirl' before the promotion of the mid-level! What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See mental and blood power They were all banned, and Lucien tried to enter the soul library under the subconscious, but there was no induction in the soul, as if it was hidden by the strange power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the opening of the soul library require spiritual power as a medium?" Lucien never tried to enter the soul library in the event of losing his mental strength, so Inferred according to common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who has not given up his efforts, continues to try to use the summoning mark on his neck to see if he can let the Rhine fall in his dreams - he is nicknamed "Observer" You should know the legend of the Dark Mountain "Devil's Land", and Lucien now doubts that he has fallen into this demon land, and needs more information and more information! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no blood power, no mental strength, the summoning imprint can not be stimulated, Lucian can not help but frown, seems to have returned to just passed through The weak stage of learning magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a normal person's body, there is a lot of spiritual essence that has been mutated, and there are many, many thoughts and keenness to overcome. So I can't be depressed, There is hope! The most important thing now is to collect the information here, so that we can decide what to do next." Lucian quickly recovered calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even if the soul returns to the ordinary, Lucien can still maintain a good psychological state, will not waver and hesitate, after so many hardships, do not give up, The unyielding belief is one of the most precious treasures of life, and the other wealth is the knowledge that has been mastered by oneself, such as the understanding of the banned bracelet, the defensive collar alchemy structure and the magic array! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pulled the iron door and found that he was locked, so he went back to the bed and was ready to try to study the imprisoned bracelet. At this time, the key sounded like a clear sound outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien clearly heard the sound of the key inserted into the keyhole, then slammed and the iron door was slowly pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ruddy face looks like a drunken young man with a bunch of keys slowly coming in, his back seems to be used to the name of the bow, but As soon as he saw Lucien, he stood up and arrogantly said: "If you wake up, follow me to see the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing There are black robes and trousers in the servant, and there are no imprisoned items on the wrists and neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master?" It’s hard to wait until other people appear. Lucien naturally won’t let go of the opportunity to ask, at least before going to see the mysterious "master" Understand where this is, why are you here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man glanced at Lucien with angrily: "What qualification do you have to call the owner? You are the only guy who sees the lack of experimental materials and saves them!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to remember that you are the lowest and most despicable experimental material in the Magic Tower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heart stunned, magic tower, experimental materials, this is only a better result than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as long as there is no death, there is hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save me back? What is this place?" Lucine, who did not understand it, continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper of the young servant seems to be a bit violent, and the tone is getting worse: "I grew up here, how do I know how to describe it here? Those who are not careful The guy who came in and then couldn’t get out of it seemed to call it the demon land of imprisonment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There was really a land of demons. My luck is too bad. A horrible change has occurred in a mission that is not so dangerous. Lu Xi'en is inexplicable and sighs slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding Elvis’s liaison, Lucien thought the mission was nearing completion because he often traveled to the adventurer’s camp and the king of nightmare. The magic tower, he has led the way will not encounter strong magical creatures, who knows that the devil's land actually moved over, making the danger index rise rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
