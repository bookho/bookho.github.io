			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steel Golem, large-scale structure, immune slash, puncture and other physical damage, immune to any magic that affects the mind, spirit, soul, immune curse, blessing , that is, dead magic, immune dead magic, immune toxins and deformation, strong defense, can effectively block the elemental damage caused by most of the magic of one to five rings, can be corroded by strong acid, can be slowed by electric shock, can be magnetic field Influence, but it requires a power of at least five rings to have a significant effect. It accepts commands and faithfully executes it, and is one of the magician's favorite guards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi In the mind of the sea, this magical image of the ancient magic inheritance is flashed, and the way of fighting is quickly determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golem takes a step back and the ground on this layer trembles slightly, as if some of them can’t bear its weight, and it’s swaying by itself, it’s hard to grasp balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch the opportunity, Carina condenses three dark green magic long arrows in front of him, shooting the tall and wide body of the statue without gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second ring magic "strong acid arrow"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the icy steel body, a little bit of rust appears, but they are so small relative to the whole body, so worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Golem was not affected, carrying a giant hammer, running at a slow speed, and gently rubbing the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the imposing steel golem, Lucien and others feel strong pressure, blocking the otherwise narrow walkway like a sheep The intestine path only leaves room for the giant hammer to wave, making it completely impossible to fight with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his hand, the head of the steel magical figure suddenly flew innumerable small silver, gray, red, light green light, thick The metal head is thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this magic?" Faced with the steel golem impact, Karina, who has a soft leg and feet, suddenly sees this strange change, Lucien’s magic actually Breaking the magic resistance of the Iron Golem. And this is not the point, the focus is on directly decomposing its metal head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of magic seems to be only the master of the legendary elements can be displayed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the excellent effect of "order of elements", Lucian frowned, and the resistance of the steel magic to magic was so good, he himself It takes at least a dozen times to use the elemental order to break down its head core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in such a "narrow" walkway, the distance is so short, there is no space for fighting, even if it is slow with lightning, the steel golem, it is a few seconds The bell can also be thrown in front of you, so unless you immediately retreat, return to the next level, and lead the steel magic image to the open place, in order to have a chance to slowly decompose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can lead to a problem, the steel magic is like a robot, relying on pre-set rules to act, after accepting the command is a rigid observance, there is great It may only attack the enemy who invades a certain range, and will not catch up at all. If it can't kill the enemy in a short time, it may not be able to send a warning to the witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the offense could not evade in the narrow aisles, winning the opportunity to use the "elemental order" for more than a dozen times, and then retreating could surprise the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I constructed the four-ring magic 'twisting magnetic field', it would be fine." Lucien sighed slightly. The strong magnetic field can interfere with the operation of the precise structure inside the steel magic image, while slowing its action is the best magic to deal with most metal magic images. But Lucien has not yet had time to construct it in the soul, miss the curse display, and Due to the lack of a hand, it is difficult to use gestures, so it can not be used, "Wait, interfere with the operation of the internal precision structure? You can try that magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since the discovery of electromagnetic induction, the magic of magnetic fields has emerged in an endless stream. Most of the metal-type magic images have to be added with the steps of preventing strong magnetic fields, although the effect is not very good, because it will affect other structures, but at least it will not The emergence of a four-ring magic will make it easy to create a five-level or even higher-order metal golems to collectively clear the scene - in the guise of the electromagnetic system magic, many magician metal magic encounters Such a pathetic and pathetic thing, except for the rare Golden Golem, Mithril Golem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Adam stepped back a few steps, he saw the steel golem waving a giant hammer and rushed to the front, and Lucian’s magic did not seem to be able to kill it in a short time, so he gritted again and his body darkened and began to start. There are ripples of the same color ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark assimilation", the strongest ability of the dark blood, can transform everything within a certain range into darkness and swallow it, use it once, it will exhaust minute. Adam can understand all kinds of consequences, so I try my best to solve the steel magic image with the help of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black ripples, Adam wrapped the steel golem with its giant hammer, and the darkness seemed to be the belly of a beast, twisting and wriggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his right hand, his lips slightly open, invisible, slow fluctuations spread toward the front, into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness shook and slammed back, and the steel magic figure fell to the ground and was holding a giant hammer to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After exhausting Adam, he recovered his body and looked at Lucien with dizziness. What magic did he use? It can affect the use of "dark assimilation" slightly, but it seems that the effect on the steel magic is not very good, not as good as the magic of the decomposition element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Adam turned to think that dark assimilation can swallow a lot of magic, and he just wrapped the steel golem, maybe because of this, the steel magic is not What effect, but why does Lucien not wait until the end of his attack and then apply magic? He is not like someone who is taking the opportunity to start with himself. He is not so irrational! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next look at you!" Adam saw the steel golem climbing, while gasping, while rushing through the secondary mind line to Lucy En said that being attacked by the dark assimilation into the steel golem should not withstand the magical blow of two or three decomposition elements, as long as Carina knows how to use electric magic to help slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this powerful golem, Alva and Brad have no room to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carina did not live up to Adam’s expectations, raised his hand, and countless tiny electric lights entangled into a ball and hit the steel golem, then spread around it, making The movement it climbed became a bit slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the opportunity to pass the caster buffer, and waited until the steel golem regained the front rush, then lifted his right hand again, letting the invisible, slow fluctuations focus before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry back, pull away the distance, and then the carina magic is slow, repeated several times, should be able to get rid of the steel before exiting this layer ...... "Adam reminds Lucien, Karina and others through the secondary mind connection, while Alva, Brad and Carina have already made a retreat, fully agreeing with Adam's approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Adam's words are not finished, the Iron Golem body makes a strange sound of jingling, like someone who is holding a metal giant hammer and destroying it inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, the steel magical eyes flashed red and the eyes went out, and the sky was carried down, making a loud bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was killed?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, what is this magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secondary mind connection, several voices sounded at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Rings Magic, "Professor's Infrasound Resonance"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently sighed, and when he created this magic, he has recorded the internal vibration frequency of most of the creatures and structures that can be touched. The Witch's Iron Golem is different from the general Iron Golem due to her own special magical structure, so the first attack will not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after the feedback adjustment, the infrasound wave with strong surname and high energy finally caused the resonance of the precise structure inside the steel magic image, causing great damage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the energy is enough, Lucien can even let it completely collapse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
