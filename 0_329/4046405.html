			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you killed him?" Sophia’s crisp, charming voice shook visibly, with intense horror and panic, which was probably her first time. Seeing the familiar aristocratic youth was killed in the living, the wounds were smashing, the blood was flowing, and the eyes were screaming, as if they did not expect that they would die under the sword of Duda, and should not be transmitted by the magic array after serious injury. Going out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was used to the dead, and the intelligent creatures killed by himself were not one or two. At this time, there was no panic, disgusting, and no huge impact, just Can't bear to look up and look up at the dome of the underground palace. The strange change of the magical array just eliminated the effect of the sudden death transmission? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the instinctive change of the underground palace after some stimulation, or is someone deliberately doing it? If it is intentional to change, what is the purpose of the conspirators behind the scenes? After such a change, can the outside Duke of the Gorse, the Earl of Nuremberg and others not be able to observe every move in the underground palace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case, it may be good news for yourself, able to show strength without reservation, and let all the intrigues of the children disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of absolute power suppression, it takes only a short time to reach the secret room, open the secret passage, and enter the inner layer of the palace of the Sun King Tanos. Magic ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the question is, what about the golden knight in the underground palace? "Glory crown" Midrand? This is the most important reason why Lucien chose to go with Sophia instead of going straight to the Chamber of Secrets! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Da hands on the ground, regardless of the bloody squatting back: "I, I did not, I did not want to kill him, I, I just intend Defeat him, seriously hurt him, but he, unexpectedly, stood there stupidly, refused to send away, he refused to send away! Not my fault, blame himself! Not my fault!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screams intermittently, stuttering and hysterically, his eyes are ignorant, his head is shaking, his head is mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-traumatic stress disorder, somehow, Lucine’s mind suddenly popped up with this psychological term. Du Da seems to be the first to kill, and still kills a familiar aristocratic child without any psychological preparation. The impact can be imagined, and the spirit is inevitably out of order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm, Duda, calm down, this is not your fault, the magic in the underground palace is a problem." Lucien recently focused on " "Fantasy", coupled with the frequent use of deformed masks, worried about their psychological problems, so has been making up the "behavioral psychology" and other related books, at this time very "experts" to "pacify" Du Da. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of gentleness like a warm wind seems to ease the tension and panic of Sophia next to it, a little puzzled and a little surprised to see "Bolaq", As if I didn't expect him to face death, facing the terrible changes in the underground palace, it would be so calm, so that people around him could not help but calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of emotions flashed in a flash, Sophia softly opened and helped to open Duda: "Yes, this has nothing to do with you, it is a magical problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not my fault! It’s a magical problem!" Hearing the explanation of Lucien, Duda grabbed the last one like a drowning man. Life-saving straw, very crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After appeasing a few words, see Duda’s mood is a little smoother. Lucien took out his pocket watch and looked at it: “Can tell us what happened just now. Is it something?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duda, eager to get rid of guilt, tells the story of what happened before and after the recollection of the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the underground palace, he appeared in a nearby bedroom, and then proceeded to the depths of the palace according to the layout changes of the map, trying to work with Alten Waiting for others, I can't think of a narrow-minded aristocratic youth who is in a different camp from the usual situation. Suddenly, the two of them are full of blood and fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I fight without fancy, no mentor, no help, Duda is more and more excited, and the body name and fighting talent contained in the body are thoroughly After playing out, after a hearty fight, Ge Fei flew the opponent's sword, stepped forward, and slammed into the opponent's neck without scruple, anyway, he would be sent out by the magic array after serious injury, and there were several days outside. The Cavaliers are not lacking in therapeutic agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desperate gray, who didn't have the slightest anger, was deeply engraved in Duda's mind, and he was afraid of fear when he thought of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Duda’s remarks and verifying the time node, Lucien confirmed that he was sensing the moment when the magical array changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the perspective of the scope, it is the time when you think someone is following us." Sophia also remembered the abnormality before "Bolaq" and pulled him to Aside, whisper, so as not to be heard by Duda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not afraid of the wind and flashed his tongue and said: "After I wake up the silvery moon, the dangerous premonition is getting stronger and stronger. Maybe the stars have blood. This special surname, after all, is related to the stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this explanation, Sophia has no doubts, and he said pitifully: "I don't think I will come in for trials, but there will be such changes. , Borak, you said who would be the hands and feet? Is there any conspiracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green eyes are covered with a layer of water mist, Miao Man's body Weakly trembled like a wind, the face of the blown bullet was slightly pale, and the pink lips were biting tightly. This beautiful picture can stimulate the strong desire of most male surnames, completely forgetting that she is a five-level blood. Warlock, can't wait to hold her in her arms and pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of time, you can probably rule out the possibility of doing your hands and feet. Lucian answered coldly, because Sophia was by his side and could not beat himself. The use of special items, magic or rituals affects the operation of the underground palace, but many magical arrays can be delayed and cannot completely rule out Sophia's suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, my Royal Highness, I will protect you with my life." Lucian pretended to be a fascinating look, "love can not help" stretch out his left hand, Slightly hesitantly shot on Sophia's slender shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia gently sighed, showing the flirtatious weakness, following the comfort of Lucien, clinging to his left hand, leaning on his body, a touch The fragrance is fascinating: "I am a warlock, I need a firm knight to help me in front of me, in order to play all the strength. We support each other, we can crush all the plots, let you become the Earl of Goldeneye, when..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will step all the schemes under my feet!" Like all the men who were stunned by the tenderness and blood, Lucien was "outrageous" Confidently, I seem to think that there is no more difficulty in the world to stop myself. Even the right hand of the "Frost" sword is hung down and placed on his waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Sophia suddenly stood up in awkwardly, blushing and shy, and even a few steps back, Lucien’s right hand was quietly from the waist. Leaving, revealing the storage bag below, Holm's crown ring "electronic" slipped into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are only two people who can do this kind of hands and feet, my brother or Alten! One is the future emperor, one is the most likely to be the golden tit The people of the Duke of Flowers, only they can make the "Glory Crown" of the underground palace cooperate. After all, Lord Midalun has already reached the end of his life, and he needs to provide his immediate descendants with care for a long time in the future."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia converges with shyness and analyzes dignifiedly, "And their goal, no doubt is me and you. Father is very fond of me, the empire is not without the Queen, and The first heir to the gorse family had 'accidental' deaths several times before boarding the throne's throne. We are not dead, they can't feel at ease! I will say why my brother will suddenly come to participate in the gorse trial!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Glory Crown" is also cooperating with them? Then what do we do? They are not afraid of being investigated by the wrathful emperor afterwards?" Lucien is "panicked" and " Unbelievable. Authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since they have done this, they must have thought about how to be good, maybe Uncle Ulrich is also their alliance! This will be able to plant the crime. In the dead us, it is said that we first attempted to misbehave, and then they died in a desperate fight.” Sophia’s face was gloomy. “As for Lord Midarun, although he is a golden knight, his body has begun to fail, as long as we There is hope in the first arrival in the Chamber of Secrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hope?" Lucien asked "very confused." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s voice is low: “There is also a secret passage in the secret room that leads to the inner layer of the palace, where high-order scrolls can be found, and powerful methods can be controlled. This is the only hope for us to save our lives. This secret, the people of the gorse family do not know, or the father found the trial by chance when he was young, and he only told me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
