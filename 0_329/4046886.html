			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, in a temporary lab and live room, in addition to Douglas and this time as his assistant, Lucien, All the members of the Supreme Council were able to come back, and the people who were responsible for the broadcast of "Sky Satellite TV" such as Samantha and Louise were waiting for it, waiting to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they still don’t know what the experiment of the public broadcast is, but see a big person in the highest appraisal group as a big enemy, guarding very much It is difficult to restrain the expression of desire, and see this experiment has a "brainer" Lu Xien? Evans personally participated, and there is inevitably some speculation in his heart. Is it a decisive and subversive experiment in the microscopic field? Is it one of the thought experiments that you mentioned before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas faced the broadcast of the magic array, trying to make his expression less serious, but consistently kind and kind: "Yes, I believe you all know that I am promoted. God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the general schools and aristocratic schools, Ali, Langman, Jane and others are excited to answer and seem to be working with this "Arcane" The emperor "face-to-face communication, the vision of the day is too eye-catching and too brilliant, it is difficult to ignore it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken in the holy city of Lans is secretly saying: "The so-called experiment, in fact, is the opportunity to take the opportunity to promote the promotion of the gods to the real public? The morale and confidence of the supporters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not feel that any experiment can threaten himself, after all, he has no cognitive world, and the heart of faith Under the control of myself, there will be no shaking, so I will receive the signal without worry, and draw a wall to display the image in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other cardinals have a higher level of understanding of the "God of Truth" after Wicken reveals how to steal the power of faith to condense the divine nature. "I don't think there is any situation that can easily shake my "belief heart". Therefore, I also watched the live broadcast with various means. I want to find out the purpose of the Magic Council in the first time so that I can respond in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those cardinals, most of them are trembled, not only curious about what this experiment is, why they use the form of live broadcast, and dare not directly Watching, the companion who was swallowed by the Holy Light and turned into a torch or fireworks is still vivid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The celestial system...the promotion of the sun...maybe you are the 'king of the sun'..." Rudolph II heard Douglas announce himself After the advanced class, he looked at the screen with a little self-deprecating. "And I still concentrate on the path of the 'God of Truth.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is such a self The language seems to be ending the identity of the past magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the live screen, Douglas smiled and said: "Becoming a god is really a big thing, but for me, the most joy is that there is a class. After the power of God, I was able to explore the fields that I could not explore in the past, and I was able to complete experiments that I could not finish in the past. For example, I want to know if there is another planet with the same intelligent life in this vast universe. For example, the two thought experiments I envisioned by the Arcanists, such as Evans, can be completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali listens to God as if he really feels the pair Unknown is full of enthusiasm for exploration, and should not change the "Arc of the Arcane". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of discourse is spoken from a class of gods, let him feel more about the charm of the arcane and the minds of the Arcanist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other arcane masters, knights, and ordinary people who worship the gods of the gods, under the description of Douglas’s understatement, also seem to have a vast universe. , the sense of small gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thought experiments?" Wicken gently tapped the desk and guessed which two thought experiments were, which could not blame him for being clever and sharp. There are too many thought experiments put forward by the great Arcanists such as Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas pointed to Lucien next to him: "This live experiment will be done by me and Evans, so that everyone can really understand the wonders of the microscopic field. Honestly, I don't know what happens to myself. We will work with you to face any possible situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Micro-domain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicken, Rudolf II, and the "Hell Lord" Maldi Moss and other gods are dignified. After Lucien proposed the concept of quantum superposition and pervasiveness and contracture, they found that this has its own form of existence. There are many similarities, so I’ve put all my attention into the micro-domain, and that’s why they ignored Douglas before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the screen carefully, using various means to confirm whether there were other factors affecting the experiment, and one of the few thought experiments was vaguely guessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evings first demonstrated the electronic double-slit interference experiment." Douglas took a step back and let Lucien step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien removed his top hat and hung it on the coat rack next to it, a leisurely and self-satisfied look at his own home. The tension and fear hidden in the hearts of many arcans are gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien began repeating the electronic double-slit interference experiment that he did a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When electrons pass through double slits, they form a classic interference fringe between the dark and the dark on the back screen, whether it is Ali, Langman, Jane, etc., or the sea. The singers, Annick and other arcans have also been amazed. Although they have already known the results through witnessing or newspaper radio, they have the momentum and the momentum of the trajectory of the electrons showing pure volatility. Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Lucien installed a recording alarm next to each of the two gaps, the sound of the cymbal sounded to confirm that the electron passed. Which gap, the interference fringes on the screen disappeared, showing pure particleness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Even after reading the records of the electronic double-slit interference experiment from the "Sound of Mystery", "Arcane Guide" and other channels, Ali Lang Man, Jane and other ordinary people have the opportunity to witness the process of this experiment, and the experiment is simple and easy to understand, the result is so incredible, so they all stunned and shook their heads, seemingly unable to believe, Just observing which gap the electron passed through and alerting you, the interference fringe is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics are even more magical than magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Heidi, Katrina and other arcans looked at the teacher seriously and experimented. This experiment is not a phenomenon, but how to go. Explain this phenomenon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick slightly picks up the water cup and tries to drink a level of rejuvenation. Sprint is clenched with both hands, against the experimental platform in front, not letting the heart The emotions are exposed, they probably guess what two thought experiments will be next! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the result? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien explained and demonstrated after the electronic double-slit interference experiment, smiled: "Next, we make a deformation of this experiment, in the principle of maintaining In the case of change, the interference is minimized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Lucien re-arranged a new experiment and showed through demonstration that it was double-slit with the electronic Interference experiments are equivalent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really equal, no problem..." Fernando slightly decapitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken, Rudolf II and other gods have little research on arcane, but as a god, judging whether two experiments are equivalent or not relaxing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, we performed a quantum erase experiment, which is to make a change to the experiment. Before, everyone should have seen it, next to the double seam The two 'recording alarms' record whether the electrons have passed their own gap and sounded an alarm, the interference fringes disappeared, and the particle appearance appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, let's let the 'recording alarm' light record not alarm, and erase the recorded content in the first time, then what will we see? Will the interference fringe disappear?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien describes the principles of experimentation in plain language, not the actual experimental process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course the interference fringes disappear, the particle is present, which is not substantially different from the previous experiment. The only difference is whether we let us know by the alarm sound. What gap does the electron pass through, but we know it, what effect can it have on the experimental results?" Langman learned the basic knowledge of arcane for several years, and can still make certain judgments on this "simple principle" experiment. Guessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
