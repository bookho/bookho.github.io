			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm is still there, but the lightning and the thunder have become scarce, so the night is getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basement of a manor in the suburbs, Fernando was sitting in the corner in a gloomy face, and Roland anxiously walked back and forth, quietly sneaking out to inquire about the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even the owner of this manor did not know that the evil magicians turned his manor basement into their stronghold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night watchman was confused by our arrangement and chased the wrong direction." After a while, Roland quietly flashed in, while avoiding several traps. I will tell Fernando the news I heard. "According to the previous training, other people were divided into groups to hide in other strongholds. How many mages and apprentices have been lost to know things."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando neither nod nor shake his head: "What I want to know is, why can the black-clawed dog find it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is bright red In the eyes, it seems to hide a horrible storm in the brewing, so that Roland, a friend who is familiar with him, has subconsciously stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland calmly said: "Yes, this is my question. The stronghold is very hidden, and it was the first time we started it. It was not black claws along the way." The signs of dog tracking, I think maybe someone can't keep going and rely on the black-clawed dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is not weak, betrayal, killing, fleeing The theme of the late Twilight War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigate in secret, don't arouse big movements for a while, good traitors may be able to 'help' us, and now two or three groups are separated from each other, Except for the two of us, no one knows where the other group is hiding. The traitor can hardly cause too much damage.” Fernando’s attitude was contrary to Roland’s expected calmness, and he thought he would be angry. Will growl, can't wait to get out of the traitor, torture him with all kinds of magic to help Ingrid revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gently daggers: "I understand how to do it, to be honest, Fernando, I thought your temper will be out of control."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s face is not smiling at all: “My anger is waiting for a suitable time to break out.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is secretly Sighed, although I have known Roland for many years. It’s an old friend, but he still doesn’t know himself. He is a thorn in love, an eager character, a roar, a look down on others, but he can control himself. Understand the situation, even if it is not convinced, it will not stubbornly persist in the face of the facts and truths. The roar is mostly wrong for people, and now it is best to decide what to do. The anger will slowly accumulate and wait until the day of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the habits and signs of shooting, today's command of the night watchman's team is 'vulture'." Roland shifted the topic to the analysis of today's sneak attackers, " He has been pursuing us for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vulture" is their nickname for a high-ranking vigil, the other is the top 30 of the night watchman By. Eight-level Knight, codenamed "Hunter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. At the end of the evacuation, he was hit by my 'Shadow Arrow' and he also broke my defense, if there was no spell trigger Maybe I have to find a way to turn it into a lich." Fernando affirmed Roland's speculation, and then anger was hard to suppress the tunnel. "We have to plan an action, secretly killing him, let all the night watchmen, pastors and dare to hunt us. The knight is afraid, no longer so hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Assassination of the punctual vigil, this will arouse the church's rebound, maybe there will be a legend to hunt down We, are you willing to give up the foundation here?" Roland doesn't quite agree with Fernando's thoughts. The "sorcerer union" where he is waiting is very weak. It is the time to avoid attention and to be silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the weakness, we need to do something big, let the magicians understand that we are hopeful, and anyway, the traitor, most of Pefus County The foundation has to be passively abandoned, and our next goal is very clear, that is, to win over the aristocrats who are not satisfied with the church, hiding behind them." Fernando seems to know Roland's thoughts, his black hair is flustered. Down, the battle with the "hunters" was not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Fernando replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Fernando, who was shutting up, Roland seemed to see a storm of human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine, blue sky, the faint sea that comes with the wind Awkward, these make Padre Port full of charm unlike other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Roland dressed as merchants who came to pick up the goods, walked back and forth in the fixed area of ​​the dock, and left the corner of the eye to the place where the sailboat was parked, according to Garros The agreement with Douglas, this will be the meeting place, and the white gloves and the dark red towel in the pocket are the identity marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classical sailing boat approached slowly, Fernando and Roland at the same time, this is the ship that Douglas took, one day later than scheduled. - The weather in the Stormwind Strait is bad, and it is very normal for the ship to be late. It is not surprising that the two are not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Claw Dog!" Suddenly, Fernando’s face changed slightly. He saw several men covered in cloaks leading dozens of noble knights and attendants. Going to the place where the ship is about to stop, their black unique gloves indicate their identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is gloomy: "Is it a routine check, or is it specific to Douglas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Antiphler fell, more and more magicians came to the Kingdom of Holm, the church began to pay attention to the inspection of the ship, of course, with their assigned hand and energy, most magicians can still hide their identity, as long as it is not Specifically, a Master is not afraid of this level of inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I know!" Fernando whispered, "You have to watch the strength of the night watch to judge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a neatly dressed businessman walked in from outside the dock, and the two immediately stopped discussing and continued to pretend to be waiting for their own goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, two gentlemen, is your cargo arrived?" The businessman is tall and tall, about 30 years old, with a high nose. The hair is thick and the forehead is full. The five senses can only be regarded as correct, but not handsome, but the deep blue eyes make him have a unique temperament, a kind of temperament that Fernando is quite familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed and said: "Not yet, it is estimated that the sailboat carrying our goods was blocked by the storm, what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He communicated passionately like a real businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My goods are here, right in front of me." The businessman smiled and said that the temperature was mild. It makes people feel like a spring breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Roland snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando understands it, whispered: "Douglas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looks at it To the other side, it was noticed that the young businessman was also wearing white gloves and a dark red towel in his chest pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, are you friends of Garros?" The young businessman admitted his identity and asked awkwardly. It seemed that he was not afraid to be vigil. people. Don't worry about ambush nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you, how come you come in from outside?" Roland felt a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas laughed and said: "I got off the boat early, came from the bottom of the sea, and waited for you in the port for a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile is a bit ridiculous, it seems that there is a kind of child-like cleanliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder there is no fear of encountering night watchmen and ambushes. Before I was afraid that I had checked it around carefully, Roland suddenly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goods are delayed, let's come back tomorrow, everyone will have a drink and exchange." Fernando said in the merchant's language. The heart is slightly disgusted with Douglas in front of him, because he is also a head higher than himself! And not as thin as Roland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
