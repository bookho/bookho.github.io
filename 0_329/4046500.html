			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this heterogeneous space has a semi-cured space barrier everywhere, the flight speed is greatly reduced, and the whole world is still in a backward open state, no long distance Accurately positioned the transmission array, so when planning, Francis and El did not consider the possibility of the rush of the war master. After all, the Angloama empire and the Erdo peninsula are separated by a small inland sea. Even more distant, even without any accidents, the legend will take two days or so to arrive, and the war master, who has not yet been promoted to the legendary field, will have at least seven or eight days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no pseudo-god is willing to leave the "Divine" for too long. When Anatans defeated Afando but was escaped by him, he only ordered The priests and the heroes of the gods searched for the hunt. They returned to the Angloama empire for the first time. There was no particularly important thing. At most, the avatars came over instead of coming as they are now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the expected incarnation of the warlord becomes the ontology and exerts a near-legendary nine-level power, the weak period of El is being an arrow Hole through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is estimated from time that the Lord of War should have left the Angoma empire a week ago, and that He is certainly not alarmed by the description of our blown through the sky. But for other reasons. Is it to completely surrender the gods such as Lushen? If this is the case, this theological debate is a conspiracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" However, He sent incarnations, combined with several high priests and heroes of the gods, and drove the moon god and the underworld to dominate, but also can firmly hold down other relatively weak sects, no need to risk such a big risk to come, Is there another reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought flashed in the minds of Francis, the pseudo-God of the world with prophetic powers, such as the fate of the northern snow-covered plains The three goddesses, and in this minority, do not include the Lord of War and the false gods of the two major gods in the vicinity, so he certainly did not come forward in advance through the prophecy to mention the threat of El, and then say that the threat of El is now completely Is blown out, that is Future ability to get the main war fall, it is not now predict spell so far and can not predict accurately. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surging Sorna River, the deep and serene shadows caused by a group of cliffs suddenly twisted and merged, quickly ascending into the appearance of El, but his breath is weak and weak. A lot, obviously not affected, if you have not mastered the mystery of the field of resurrection, through the death of life and death to avoid a fatal blow, now I am afraid that the body has fallen, leaving only the incarnation in the domain of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El is not fortunate to escape this robbery, because this arrow completely pierces its tyrannical camouflage, exposing the weak nature to the underworld In front of the sacred gods such as the lord and the sun god, they will surely rush to come and bite in groups in the same way as the "lion dog" smelling bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, compared to the false gods that have not yet been handed, the "Arrows of the Arrow" in the Temple of War is a big worry, iron The long black arrow seems to be able to get rid of the limitations of space, just blinking, and will shoot at your side without any trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of War once again screamed, the power of terror quickly condensed, and the false gods hiding around him were eager to move. Francis suddenly flashed and flew over the Temple of War. The deep dark fog, like a black cloud, completely obscures the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black fog, it seems that there is a mountain-sized giant snake that has raised nine heads with sharp teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, the nine-headed giant snake slammed down and turned into a nine-black sorrowful sword, and the surrounding black mist was strong. Destroy the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight heads of Hydra have their own surnames, and when they gather in the head of the center, they become the purest destruction! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the title of the Knight of the Hydra blood, the title is often closely related to destruction and death, such as "eye of hell" and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, the Solna River has set off a horrible wave, and people on the shore only feel that the earth under their feet is ups and downs, making it difficult to stand up and swaying physically . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of War is wrapped in the dark fog, unable to see what is happening inside, but from the earthquake-like power, the black fog that keeps expanding and shrinking Can guess how fierce the battle inside is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his estimation, he should be able to survive for more than 30 seconds if he encounters the "master of war". If he does not pay the price, the hope of running away is very big. After all, the master of war is only instinctively using the "identity" of the body and the pseudo-god. The special ability, although the strength reached the peak of nine, the actual combat power is only close to the golden knight, unlike the main material world, has a variety of perfect blood purification and system, the higher the order or the big lord family The more the Cavaliers, the more they can access similar materials, and develop their own fighting styles and techniques. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The strength of this oracle is actually a little stronger than the original Afando..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Aer is so mediocre, is it because he has not really awakened or recovered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it have hidden horror?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The own false gods that are weak for various reasons can indeed show extremely terrifying strength for a short time, so the sun god, The god of wisdom waited again, waiting for someone to come out first, consuming the power of El. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the Solna River near El became gray and dull, dead, and the black robes of the underworld dominated and flew out from the bottom of the river. A powerful undead creature with weeks of confusion surrounds the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already turned to the Lord of War and has obtained the missionary qualifications of the Solna Valley. At this time, he must behave, otherwise he will be led by the Lord of War. The wrath, and the Lord of War is the oncoming of the body, giving him confidence, so unlike the other six false gods, the underworld masters took the opportunity to make a decision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! The screams came one after another, and the undead creatures that dominated the rotten horror of the underworld scared people to go backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underworld dominates the skinny face, two needle-like red awns violently pulsating, reflecting the weakened El, then he dragged a long sickle, With a strong death, I smashed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repent, beg for mercy, then accept my fair trial! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such an El, his faith is violently inflated, and the enthusiasm for the morning theological debates has come to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Er ​​Gang recovered from the trauma brought by the Arrow of Anatanas, facing the attacks of the underworld and many undead creatures, icy spread The breath of death seems to infiltrate his heart and make him fearful, so he has to spend more effort to control himself and then use the strongest means available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I command you, death!" El spit out two short Cuban Boolean words with a strong sense of law. This is the kind of "law-making" that he learned by himself after he mastered the field of resurrection. Different laws are lower than the same magic, regardless of the requirements or power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I could kill me like this? I am the god of death and the underworld! Not Axin's fool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he was not entangled by your gods, he was broken by the high priest of Afando, and he was not so easily injured and stripped. God's surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods of the sun, the god of wisdom, and the god of love are once again ready to move. It is clear that the death of El’s law can’t kill the underworld, and his hidden power seems to That's it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death power of El's side and the inexplicable force emerge at the same time, the dark trowel that the underworld dominates is approaching, and the needle-shaped red mantle dances with excitement and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't kill his words, I will be hit hard again, but what is the effect of the death of my current law to face the rule of the underworld..." In my heart, I came up with this idea, and I was even more panicked, but only subconsciously continued the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With El Eyes condensing, the law is issued, the joy of the underworld dominates suddenly, and then disappears silently, and his face is still left in the same place. A horrified expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just the gods of the sun, the gods of wisdom, the goddess of the earth, but also the false gods hidden around them, and Elself himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
