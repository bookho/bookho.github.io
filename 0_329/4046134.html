			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When", the high and crisp metal collision sounded, this is not the weapon of Todd et al. Blocking Natasha’s "Thunder" to Verdi The sword, but after Todd gave up the attack, he was smashed from the top to the bottom of his steeled body by Wynn's two-handed sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Even if the two-handed sword was coming to his head, Todd was only slightly dodging, did not retreat, did not take back the numerous steel knives that he had condensed and flew out to Natasha’s sword, but instead used his own body. As a shield, prevent Wynn's two-handed sword from blocking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helmet transparent metal mask was opened directly, and the stiff face shining with silver-white metal appeared. A deep scar divides Todd's nose and mouth into two. The blood flowing out of the wound is not the blood, but the silvery white metal liquid. It is trying to repair the horrible face of nightmares.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of the five-level knight and the strength of steelmaking, Todd Hard Lived in Wynn's two-handed sword. Although under the impact of power, his blood-stained sword did not unexpectedly hit Natasha's neck, but also heavily chopped on Natasha's back.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The milky white dragon that has been severely broken has no power to stop such an attack. A terrible wound appears on the back of Natasha, and the gray-gray blood spurts out. Seeing her spine and internal organs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha bit her lip tightly, without giving a little bit of pain, but with this impulse and injury, let herself wave The "Thunder" sword that was cut out was faster and more fierce.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking Silvia, the silver-white electric snake surrounded by "Thunder" became more and more dazzling. With a bang, the sky slammed a thick lightning and slammed Verdi.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary sword has a chance after hitting the opponent. Throws real lightning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken dark purple armor is quickly burnt, just with the help of Silvia and follow Verdi, who was stopped from recovering from paralysis, quickly fell into a desperate situation where his hair was upright and his limbs were slow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the long sword, Verdi His eyes seemed to spurt endless anger. Even in the face of desperation, he did not give up the will and spirit of fighting, mobilized a small amount of power that could be controlled, and the right hand broke through the sluggishness and paralysis, and caught on the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innumerable flying electric light bursts, Verdi’s right palm and his forearm are directly cut off, but this gives him time to fight, the transparent shield of truth in him The neck quickly condensed, while the two feet that eased a little and forced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shield of Truth" that has not yet fully condensed in Thunder, an illusion does not appear in the gaps in this world, only a little stagnant, the sword of truth Let the shield of truth be like a real shield, and then cross the Verdi neck that is translated backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck is cracked quickly, and the bright red blood is like a fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Verdi's backward movement made Natasha's sword not completely hit him, although his neck was broken more than half, the cervical spine also has The deep wounds, wobbled, seemed to break at any time, but by the mighty vitality of the great knight, he did not die immediately, but fell into a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saved his life at a critical moment by his own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is about to change the direction of the dragon scale horse, and send the semi-dead Verdi completely to hell, but the big knights in other directions are giving up. After being surrounded, he had already arrived at Verdi and was in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply weighed the situation and how long it took for the strength of oneself to be motivated by serious injuries. Natasha was slightly sorry but not greedily rushing past Verdi. Rushing towards the Melzer Black Forest, this is not only related to the glory of the family and the family, but also to the loyalty of the knight's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wean and Lucien because the knights hurriedly rescued Verdi, and did not encounter any blockade, they followed Natasha out of the encirclement, Yacaxia I also seized the opportunity, not to entangle the knight, but to attack the stunned Verdi, and then drove the horse with a serious injury, and quickly followed. Only Daniel, who was completely trapped in the Cavaliers in the wave attack, had been seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the full force of Natasha, the "slaughter" gun point again appeared black and convective lines, and after the flight, there was a fierce roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd did not see Natasha’s movements and subconsciously rolled from the dragon’s horseback to the wilderness. The “slaughter” was from his original place. After passing through the position, he followed the other four-level knight who was chasing after him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-level knight did not escape like Todd, but picked up the golden shield and stood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Slaughter" hit his shield, silently, the shield appeared an illusory and terrifying crack, which not only cut off the shield, but also rushed Spread to his armor and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black rifle passed through and fell to the ground. The four-level knight and his dragon-scale horse are as smashed into glass. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final explosion of Natasha by the "smugglers", the extraordinary weapon of the Violet family and its own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd stood up from the ground and saw Natasha and Lucien disappeared in the Black Forest, and saw that the back was shocked. The knights who lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of the knights stayed behind to guard the Earl, and the rest followed me to catch up." Todd looked at the unconscious Verdi and ordered him instead of him. Then, with ten knights, I went to the Melzer Black Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha must be killed, otherwise waiting for everyone is to deprive the title, the family is all executed, and after being controlled by the gods, they are sent to the northern fortress to serve as the death squad. After the end, but Todd did not dare to let all the knights follow him to kill Natasha, because Verdi's injury is very heavy, even if there are treatments, healing bandages and other items, I am afraid it will take a long time to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all the knights left, when they came back, they found that the noble and fierce Earl of Verdi was taken away by the wild wolf in the Black Forest. Things are a complete joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Into the Black Forest, the trees are thick, and the tall creatures of the Dragon Scale Horse are no longer suitable for riding and running, so Lucien et al. The man turned over and was ready to walk to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha did not stand steady after jumping down the dragon scales, and the legs fell softly and fell directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Wyan rushed over and found Natasha’s face fainting, which was already in a coma, and the belly was bloody and fuzzy. Many can directly see the through wounds behind the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the heavier the injury, the stronger the blood force is time-limited, and the aftereffects are not small." Lucien is very worried about Natasha's The situation, but still divided the mind and calmly "scientific" to assess this blood power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched Natasha’s forehead and nose, and found that the original cold skin was hot and hot, and the greasy feeling had a grainy roughness. The bulge is extraordinarily horrifying, but the breathing is fairly stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The injury is not heavy enough to threaten life, relying on the strong resilience of the great knight, Natasha will not be able to recover most of the time, but she does not know her blood The sequelae of anti-phagy should last until." Lucien came to the same conclusion as Wyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whee, who was not hurt himself, looked back at the Black Forest and signaled that Lucien took Natasha and picked up the "Thunder Sword". He himself took up the same serious injury and could not stand firm, Akasha: "Run while talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not delay, took Natasha back, Followed by Wye to the depths of the Black Forest: "Baron Wynne, we are the strongest among us. You should take the Princess of the Royal Highness out of the Black Forest and go back to Aalto, and I and Yakaxia. In the eyes of Verdi, the jazz is definitely less important than the pursuit of the Princess of the Princess. It should be no danger to hide in the Black Forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien turn left Turn, Huan smiled and replied: "The Baron Todd is a five-level knight. I can resist him for so long, relying on the Lord's blessing and the princess's encouragement. In fact, it is not as good as you can see. And it is most important. Todd is sure to bring people to catch up. He is very familiar with my characteristics and habits. I have no confidence to get rid of his tracking, so I do. I and Yakasha will open them. You will take the princess down to the dark mountains to hide. When the sun rises, the church will definitely find and send people to search, and it will be safe."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
