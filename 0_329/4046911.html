			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the light of the whole world disappeared, whether it was Allinge, Rentat, or Hell, Abyss, all in the deepest and deepest darkness. And the sound of that sly is also strange at the same time, every magician, every knight, every nobleman, every civilian, every devil and devil feels a kind of never before. Quiet, able to hear your heartbeat, even the quietness of the blood flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚! Hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of some intelligent creatures is beating faster and more intensely, just as they can’t stand the ultimate peace and want to scream The darkness fades away and the light returns to the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to have not changed. In the sky, Mardi Moss pays a great price to summon the coming "abyss will" to smell the most annoying hell and the first After the two nasty paradise mountains entangled together, they abandoned the long-standing rivalry and rushed toward Viken. The other three major gods and several legendary peaks fully cooperated with him to “help” him to dispel Wicken. The defense around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in "Ancient Hell", the two "Lu Xien" are already inseparable from each other, but the face is still changing, as if seeking for both The most essential thing in common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky with a huge fireball, the angle of view is getting closer again, the azure planet is getting bigger and bigger, and the "universe" with the foggy planet is also close to the perspective. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two planets are getting bigger and bigger, occupying almost all of the "starry sky", the devil and the lost soul in "Ancient Hell" broke out and finally The loudest scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the crisp sound of the sound of each intelligent creature, "Ancient Hell" collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devils and lost souls have been restored into a series of "negative emotional radiances" of different colors, and these entangled light began to loosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said. Two "Starry Sky" and Lucian also disappeared! It disappeared into hell and disappeared into the eyes of everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did the teacher go..." For this strange phenomenon, Heidi was a bit stunned, and when the Speaker of the House of Representatives was promoted to the gods, there was no such situation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, her eyes were solidified, because she saw "a lot of people" in the atomic research institute! There is a huge, fantasy-like tunnel that looks like a teacher's "super large particle collider"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "collider"-like dream tunnel overlaps with the many magical arrays in the Atomic Research Institute. But they don't interfere with each other, they don't affect each other, just like someone creates a illusion here with the development magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time..." Heidi, Annick and others forgot the battle at high altitude, and looked at the "huge tunnel" in front of them, watching it. The "persons" in white protective suits, they passed in front of themselves, expressions of tension and expectations. As if preparing for important experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of a shock, Heidi subconsciously extended his right hand and tried to touch one of the men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five white fingers slowly touched the man’s face, but they touched the air and directly passed through, and the other party did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina stares blankly at this scene: "The teacher's advanced vision of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Heidi took a deep breath and turned to the window. Looking at the street below, I saw the wide road in front of the Allinge Magic Tower. There were no more magicians and carriages. There was a steel monster similar to a magic car. They were crowded together and difficult. Go ahead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distance, a tall building comparable to the Magic Tower overlaps with the original building, and their glass windows are one after the other, in the sun. Under the golden glare, it is like a palace built of gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High altitude. A "only" bird-like steel monster flies quietly, overlooking the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility and the civilians were completely confused, and their mouths were slightly open and their expressions were empty. I watched the "extra world" in front of me, looked at the skyscrapers, looked at the torrent of steel, and looked at the "drawings" that were not the same as themselves and had a strange approximation. I only feel that I am still in a dream, always in a dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mirage?" Someone subconsciously said that this Evans was renamed, but his eyes were sluggish and apparently not thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the tall buildings began to blur, the steel torrent began to blur, and the tunnel of "very large particle colliders" began to blur, and that walked in the street On the other hand, human beings who collide with each other but have no sense of it begin to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, they disappeared completely, just like a dream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the vision of the teacher to promote the gods..." Heidi repeated the meaning of Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion in the air made them wake up, remembering that there was still a battle that determined their own destiny, so they looked up again and only doubted in their hearts. Thinking about what happened just now? What is the strange sight? Has Evans become a god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien and the two "Starry Sky" disappeared, Viken seized the opportunity to swallow up the broken "Ancient Hell", completely regardless of this The imbalance of oneself, because He has no way, not to merge now, and in a few seconds the ancient hell will completely collapse and disappear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps after dozens or hundreds of years, "Ancient Hell" will reunite, but that is not meaningful to Viken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, without the obstacles of Lucien, without the defense of the ancient devil and the lost soul, the Viken fusion is very smooth, but correspondingly, in addition The paradise mountain on one side began to be excluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cooperation of Douglas, "Silver Moon", "Lord of Hell", Fernando and Vicente, "Abyss Will" is not afraid of death Breaking through a lot of defenses, breaking through the strange state of Viken, constantly creating explosions, constantly creating killings and bloody, trying to kill Viken who concentrated on the ancient hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's body becomes illusory, faintly filled with pervasiveness and distortion, in the "abyss of will" does not care about its own offense. More and more bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Viken suddenly laughed, and a sly smile appeared in the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his eyes, the darkness and the light alternate, the "old hell" and the still "sunny mountain" that remain there are slamming a position. Let the "Abyss Will" be within the Paradise Mountain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich light, the ethereal song, makes the "abyss of the abyss" more and more violent. Somehow, he suddenly shouted, his body swelled rapidly, one arm and leg fell off, and one eye bulged! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Retreat, He wants to blew!" Mardi Moss snarled through strange means, "The River Tide" hurried back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paid a great price to summon the "abyss of the abyss". In order to get a strong attacker who is not afraid of death, to complete the last blow that can't be broken, can the "Abyss Will" be too dedicated? In order to complete this blow, He actually chose to blew himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Maldi Moss knows with his toes that this product is absolutely chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the attacks, the explosion was violently many times, and only half of the air was filled with endless blood. The defense of Heaven Mountain was broken, and only one angel fell. Only the blazing angels retreated to the "world of the door" in time and escaped the robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and energy storms are flying together, and Douglas and other gods are forced to the edge of the "magic world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians who watched the battles were pleasantly surprised, and a kind of god blew himself up, certainly preventing Viken and even killing him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ninth floor of Hell, Lucien’s figure slowly emerged from the void. From the pervasive state to the contraction, still wearing a black double-breasted long dress, still wearing a high hat, bow tie and monocle, still holding a cane, handsome Sven, but more than just a kind of ethereal, belongs to The world does not belong to the feeling of the world, that is, the kind of transcendental, changing, untouchable sense of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last thing I saw...it was that..." Lucien woke up from an inexplicable state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood light and energy storms quickly disappear. The central blank of the entire "magic field" is like a paper full of words. The naughty child wiped it with an eraser and other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Vicken also died with the 'Abyss Will"?" Elf Queen Aglesia asked with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this will not make Viken truly degenerate, but I do not know how many years later, He can return from the long river of fate. And when there is no Heaven Mountain, He will not have the most deadly threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Moon" is still hanging high in the sky, not falling, Maldives's bright red eyes solemnly and puzzledly look at the center, Douglas stunned and passed Similar to the method of connecting the mind: "Continue to attack! The field has not disappeared, Viken has not fallen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "magic field" is because of Vikken impact The true god appeared, and it did not disappear, indicating that Viken not only did not fall, but even the attempt to attack the true God was not completely interrupted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas voice just fell, the "magic field" inside the wind, the invisible wind whistling, in the void, a drop of "water" secreted, Giving people a feeling of darkness and light is completely contrary to common sense and logic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These waters merge into tides, rushing toward the center, flooding the gods and legendary peaks such as "Silver Moon" and "Lord of Hell". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the center, an illusory heart that is also dark and bright is highlighted, and the cockroaches are jumping, "the left atrium" is The black, evil, and fallen desperate world, the "right atrium" is the sacred, bright, vast mountain of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are close to success, but Viken is also close to success, as long as the 'heart' is destroyed, let him absorb the 'water' growth, Really stop him!" Douglas judged the situation and prepared to come directly to the "eternal blaze." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, He found that he could not cast spells, and in this dark and bright tide, he could not cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the "Lord of Hell" can not use the extraordinary power, "Silver Moon" is also difficult to break through the layers of water waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is slightly indulged, and the body is filled with it, turning into a world where there are lakes, forests, grasslands, suns and destinies. This is He. The "image" of the god of the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "world" firmly binds the nearby "tidal water", and the slap in the face suddenly becomes slow, and the "heart" of Viken is also slow. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, "Lord of the Lord" filled the body, the volcanic eruption, the nine-layered hell scene with strong sulfur smell, and the "tidal water" around itself "Take it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold and dreamy silver moon falls, the radiance of the cold ice freezes the "tidal water", the lush elf tree appears in the shadow, the root system extends into the "water", tight They are adsorbed tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projections of "Thunder and Hell", "Elemental Paradise", "Place of Sleeping" also came, but the power of restraint was obviously much smaller than that of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the force, the tide is almost stagnant, and Viken has formed a stalemate with the three gods and the legendary peaks, but slightly prevailed, little by little. Absorbs water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the legendary powerhouses below can no longer hold back, Natasha took the lead to flash high, "Sword of Truth" waved, Going to the "heart" of Viken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
