			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloomy castle, the sides of the corridor are filled with silver hand-shaped candlesticks, and a red candle on the top is shining in its own dim light. Exudes a fascinating beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lousne, wearing a black hooded robes, stood quietly outside the basement and studied the defensive array of the Count of Vlad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the ore is to be transported, the metal is to be smelted, and the slave dwarves are to enter and exit, the "daytime" Vlad Castle is not closed, only a few A few magical arrays for surveillance, plus the Count of Vlad in the castle, only the vampire bride of Tess is the middle class, so the "high-level magician" Lucien easily mixed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The defense is really strong." Lucien's slight jaw, Count Vlad, as a vampire powerman who has lived for thousands of years, did get it. A lot of good magical arrays, these twenty-seven dark-like arrays are connected to form a powerful defense that is almost locked, even if the eight-level magical blast is able to withstand it, "The good news is that Fula The Earl of Druid is a natural spell, not a orthodox mage, the castle is not an alchemy life, otherwise I want to mix in, it is not so easy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground corridor, human, The bloody servants of the elves, dwarves, and other races became the same as in the normal aristocratic family, but they all turned a blind eye to Lucien, who stood on the edge of the corridor, and regarded him as the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he hasn’t started learning the six-ring magic “group suggestion”, Lucien is working hard, and one of them hints at all the living creatures in the castle, even As a high-ranking mage, the spirit is exhausted after a lap, and it will take a while to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to break this fascinating defensive array system, at least two months of work, the most troublesome is that once you start cracking, it is easy to alarm inside. The sleeping Count of Vlad, and a high-level vampire plus his own castle, I have almost no chance of victory, and even the danger of corruption." Lucian stood at the door of the basement, his right hand rubbed his chin, analyzing the difficulties . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Vlad, although sleeping, is not the ancient inheritance magician who refused to contact the arcane in the dark mountains. Anyway, he relied on blood to cast spells, not afraid of recognition. Knowing that the world is shaking, it is easy to catch up with the trend and keep up with the times, so that Lucien, the magical parliament orthodox archer, has a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What excuse is used to let vampire brides swindle Vlad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tess I am running away with Galata? It’s too bloody!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Use their death? No, it will alert Vlad!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really trouble..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, think about it from another angle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lucien nodded thoughtfully and began to focus on analyzing the magical structure of the defense core, the flow of energy, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After more than ten days, the castle is functioning normally, and the vampire bride, the housekeeper, the blood servant, and the slave each have their own duties, which is no different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle, there is always a strange figure in a black robe walking east and west, stopping to find out what the precious materials are arranged, and it seems busy. Hey, no one else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But vampire bride, housekeeper, blood servant, slave, completely ignored the existence of such a person, even if he is near the energy well behind his own There was a burst of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, finally arranged." Lucien squatted at the door of the basement, clapped his hands and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swearing spells are ringing, the spirits are spreading out, the magical array of stress at the entrance to the basement is activated, and a star-like line is bright and bright. The light of energy flows in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound room, summoning room, magic garden, energy well, except for the energy room and control center in the basement, all the important places in the castle follow The splendid brilliance of the rapid flow of light, the different magical arrays of mysterious secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the magical mask of the night sky reflections jerked, it was tightly attached to the basement, just like the original dark defense array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Lucien’s magical array was no longer moving, and everything was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a grand and magnificent scene, the vampires and dwarves continue the original movements, as if this is the normal change of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Count of Vlad in the basement was still asleep, not aware of it at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is that Lucien did not attempt to crack his dark defense tactics, and naturally he would not be alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful magical array that Lucien spent ten days arranging, the function is very simple, that is, add a layer of defense outside the Earl of Vlad, and then Give him a "lock" to make him sleep more "safe" and more "reliable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this layer of defense is independent of each other, almost deadlocked, even if Lucien himself tries to solve it, it will take nearly ten months. And the flow of energy wells and magical gardens to the energy will pass through this magical array. If Count Vlad is awake and wants to come out, the energy will be limited to a small half. Therefore, even if he has the support of the control center, he does not have five or six years of work, and he does not want to leave the basement, and even can not even pass the message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As after five or six years, Lucien believes that he does not have to worry about the exposure of space nodes, and other accidents with minimal probability are not considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you are strong, guarded, and alert, it is difficult for me to crack or assassinate, then I will make your defense more powerful and alert. ", security is more "protected"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way out for a different way of thinking. Lucien laughs badly and doesn’t say that he is inspired by the jokes on the earth. If you don't open your lock, you will be given another one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a bit of a pain." Lucien took his chin and shook his head and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the main source of the magical array material is the "good-hearted" warehouse of Count Vlad, but Lucien also lost a large amount of plans to be placed in a critical moment. The material of the defensive array, and the real treasure house of Count Vlad, is located in the basement, so that Lucien can't recover the loss, and can only take a lot of Mithril and special metals "to comfort himself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully checking the "Strong Defense Defense Array" and confirming that it had no problems, Lucien arranged a hidden array at the entrance to the basement, which was stored. The sound of the Count of Vlad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone invites or tries to wake him up, "he" will apologize and answer that he is in a critical period of recovery, as long as it is not a "night plateau" If a strong enemy invades and is on the verge of failure, don't bother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Lucien left the castle leisurely and walked out of the gate without a few steps. He turned around with a bad taste, pressing his chest with his right hand and bending over. Priest: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have a good dream, Count Vlad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ... In the underground cave, the dwarves who signed the magic contract found the steam sledgehammer, iron stove, food, paper and other items in their own places in the cave according to the "memory". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, we need to do three things." The great elder Augustus said glory before the altar, compared to other dwarves, he I got three books, one is "Electromagnetic Transformation and Application Foundation", one is "Pope of the Pope", and the other is "On Long-Term Struggle". It seems that he is very excited, as if he has found a book to defeat the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, we must improve the doctrine as soon as possible, and quietly develop more of the same family. Second, we are looking for suitable plants in the desolate places of the earth and the plateau. Food, solve the problem of hunger as soon as possible; third, we must avoid the frontal collision with the vampire, even in a short period of time, do not have any collision, we need sufficient time to master the knowledge given by the Lord, to cast more and better machinery "Rearm yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, great elder! Steam is supreme!" Harold led the dwarves to shout, and the knowledge in the book shook deeply. They let them eagerly absorb "nutrition." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
