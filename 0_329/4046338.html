Lucien told Leo to close the door and open the protective magic array. He returned to the study and began to write a thesis. (Baidu search literature museum WwW.WxGuan.CoM)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is peaceful, the high-altitude Allinge is especially quiet and empty, in such a quiet and far-reaching atmosphere, Lucien The mind became clear, and the title was written on ordinary white paper that was not magically processed: "The experiment of the human body's own current and the brain emitting special electromagnetic waves and their application in illusion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little information on the brainwaves in the Soul Library. It should be said that the Earth is still at a shallow level in similar research. Lucien has to pass The analysis and feedback of several illusions to enrich the paper and improve the reliability of the paper belong to the type of direction and conclusion to find evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this paper is very difficult to write, if the previous papers are combined with the different worlds of the magic world and specific experiments to modify the earth. The paper, the paper belongs to the collection of materials, their own experiments, semi-original results of their own arguments, deleted and changed two or three hours before the general content is sorted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently sighed, Lucien did not write the collated content directly into a rigorous essay, but put the paper up and ready to bring it in the morning Teacher Fernando commented and revised it according to his opinion - since he has a big arcane teacher, it must not waste "resources". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes and enjoy the coolness of the night wind for a few minutes and the night when everyone is sleeping, I am alone, and after the death of the world. En again took out a stack of white paper and filed a magical quill to write an application for the Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This application was written to give Lucien a headache, because any particular research direction may reveal his own point of view on atomic issues - the atom is not The most basic substance of the division, it has a magical internal structure! However, several research directions that do not expose this point of view seem to be related to the atom, and are closer to the contents of the discharge and the magnetic field. It is really difficult to apply in the name of the Institute of Atomic Research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien had to explain the significance, purpose, and general direction of the establishment of the "Atom Research Institute" in a large and empty manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the application is re-read after completion. Lucien sighed sincerely: "It is not so easy to defraud funds. If the application of the 'Atomic Research Institute' cannot pass, it will be replaced with other specific research directions, not using the name of the 'Atom Research Institute'. However, in this case, the research of each project is short-term and cannot be maintained for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has great interest and ambition as a fraudulent fund People, Lucien has been separated from the vulgarity and low-level interest of ordinary arcans, and wants to set up a long-term fraudulent financial institution, which not only saves a lot of energy, but also reduces the cost of experimentation to a minimum. The benefits from the “Mineral and Harvest Company” can be accumulated and prepared for the future – well known. Whether it is the magical ritual of the promotion of the golden level, the construction of the magic tower after the high-order, the purchase of magical items, and the rituals of building all kinds of wonderful magic, it is a matter of spending money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The application of the Atomic Research Institute is also given to the teacher. If you can get his support, things will be much simpler. If necessary, you can reveal a little real Studying the idea..." Lucien’s eyes thought a little bit hot, although it was more likely to be roaring and criticizing, but to defraud the funds. I can only try it with my scalp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Lucien returned to calm and began to analyze the selected five-ring magic "Fernando's Lightning Furnace". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I didn’t expect my soul and mental strength to reach the five-ring standard so quickly, Lucien never tried to analyze the five-ring magic, even three A large part of the ring and the four-ring magic have not yet started, so I have to concentrate most of my energy on this. First raise the level of magic and then go back and master other low-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Evans." Two big black eyes popped out of the door. Taling Prosper warmly said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien politely replied: "Good morning, Prosper, how have you been recently? Yesterday I forgot to say hello to you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still, every day, I have to tolerate the magicians coming in and out of my body. Yesterday, huh, huh..." Prosppel definitely does not admit that he is afraid to The storm dominated in front of him. "Mr. Evans, I heard that you are coming to the Fifth Ring? I like the magician who is so fast. I am waiting for you to become a high-level magician. When you start building the magic tower, don't forget our agreement, a female tower. Gentle, patient, meticulous, much better than me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did we have an appointment... Lucien was perfunctory and promising Pros A few words from Pell, tightening the neckline and stepping into the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is still early, the parliamentary headquarters is cold and clear, and Lucien has not met anyone to the thirty-three-story Fernando study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominates Fernando or wears his favorite bright red ancient style robes, sitting behind the desk reading a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, if there is nothing else, read the letters for me first, then write a reply according to my dictation. After doing all this, let's go to the experiment. The room measures the thermal radiation data of different substances at different temperatures.” Fernando did not praise Lucian’s positive early arrival, and directly told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hurriedly replied: "Teacher, I wrote the paper last night, please guide."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Efficiency is not slow." Fernando nodded, took the white paper in Lucien's hand, not because it is a middle-level magician's paper, but casually look at it, but carefully Read on the ground and perform magic verification from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Fernando’s brows slowly wrinkled, and Lucien suddenly felt a horrified feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The logical relationship is far-fetched, what do you use to convincing the audit committee?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mistakes in the anticipation finally appeared, but fortunately not roaring, Lu Xien quickly made the appearance of listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost criticized Lucien’s paper from beginning to end, letting Lucien have a feeling of “no value”, Fernando put away Highly screaming, gently nod: "Of course, compared to most arcane masters or rigid rigid, or erroneous papers, you are quite interesting. Both groundbreaking and breakthrough, there are not many omissions. After correcting or clarifying the logical order of the mistakes, submit them to the Audit Committee. Right, don't learn the name of the teacher on the paper like other magician disciples. I don't want my name to appear in this kind. The less rigorous paper above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, teacher." Lucien quietly wiped the sweat that did not exist. Although Fernando did not growl, but many of the loopholes pointed out by the bloodshots still make him unable to bear the cold sweat, there is a illusion of being attacked by the storm, how did he find these mistakes when he examined it? The first semi-original paper really had a lot of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Fernando pick up the letter again, Lucien is busy: "Teacher, I am going to apply for an arcane research project. Please take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Australian research project, can you allocate your energy?" Fernando took the application and asked casually. Then there is some funny way, "Atomic Research Institute? This is really a big research project. Well, the main direction of this research is to study the relationship between the periodicity of elements and the atom, and to explore the difference between atomic quantity and volume among different element atoms. In addition, why do you show various kinds of properties? And try to fuse elements and electromagnetics, light and dark magic at the atomic level... In general, in order to promote the development of elemental magic and the perfection of the arcane system, the application was established. I hope the committee approves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando read Lu Xi'an's application report one word at a time. In the face of this apparently "unfair" thing, he did not treat it with the rigorous attitude of arcane and magical research. His face showed a humorous smile: "Need a large and complete high-level laboratory? Need so many rare Materials? Need a lot of Arcane point subsidies? Young people. The Arcane research funding is not so deceptive, this kind of grand, large and empty application, the Magic Research Council is certainly impossible to approve. And your ambition is still very big, it seems to be Long-term maintenance of the 'Atomic Research Institute'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
