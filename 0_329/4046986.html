			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame-like priest looked at Fernando with his eyes without holes: "He gave this villa to the great gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is he?" Fernando asked solemnly, feeling more and more strange inside, isn’t Tucker planning to flee here? How suddenly became a believer in the evil spirits? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he have been completely distorted by the priests of the evil gods, even the evil spirits themselves, and become a "devotee" without self? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the priest became no ups and downs: "He is in the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am him Friends, I am coming to him, I hope you can take me to the temple to see him." Fernando was not willing to venture directly into the nest of the grotesque believers, but from the normal analysis, he came to look for Tucker, and There is also a "Mage official residence", a city controlled by a magician. It is really dangerous. You can get assistance completely. If you don't go, it is easy to be discovered by mysterious pursuers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Fernando is very clear in mind, in fact, this is not necessarily a city controlled by a magician, which is inferred from the appearance of the "helper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest is moving forward slowly, just as he can see things as lightly bypassing Fernando: "Follow me, the skeptical mage, to the temple, you I will feel the majesty and sublimity of the gods, knowing that Tucker has chosen a better path from the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stop? Fernando had no time to think about it, followed the priest out of the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the night is deep, the silver moon is dark, the city is full of darkness, rare lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando followed the priest unhurriedly, but his brain was running fast. Analysis of the whole thing: "A magician has become a believer in the evil spirits after leaving such a note. The whole city can not enter and exit. And there are people who specialize in sending water and food... This is the magician. What is being done in this city secret, or the believer of the evil spirits quietly penetrated into Kufrey, holding it in his hands, and then blocked the city for confidentiality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not difficult to logically come up with these two guesses. Because it is a region controlled by a magician after all, it is close to the churches of different gods, and the hands of dark creatures, elves, dwarves, or truth gods can't stretch out so long, it is easy to be discovered, and the former also includes the possibility of cooperation with evil spirits. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He weighs and judges these two possibilities, tries to figure out the whole situation, finds a way to escape, and from the caller is a magician, this seems to point more to the latter may. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest in front went to the market area. Pushed the door of a shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of groceries in the door, and there is nothing special about it. The priests dexterously walk through this messy place without encountering anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the store, a stone step slanted to the ground, and there was a faint yellow glow inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coffrey also has such a secret room. It is no wonder that the Archmage can hide and seek help." Fernando secretly, suddenly. His brow wrinkled and noticed the contradiction: "I have inferred before that the mysterious chaser is at least a strong nine. Otherwise, the Archmage who has the ability to make me dream can not be trapped here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""A strong person, after knowing that his enemies are hiding in the city, is a secret investigation, or directly using the strongest means, two or three Between the entire city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando believes that the strong people of this era have not taken into account the good intentions of their own lives, and can complete the task as soon as possible. It is inevitable to choose the appropriate method. So as not to delay the time, the enemy’s reinforcements arrived and stifled on the spot. So, how could the strongman choose to “hide and hide” in Kufrey and the Archmage, and check it out a little. He is not afraid of any legendary lord. Have you passed by here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the direct use of Thunder to destroy the city, to force or directly kill the Archmage in the hiding place is the most effective means - unless he hides The ground is deep and deep, or there are nine levels of lock protection, and the former is easy to be discovered by extraordinary means if there is no spell effect protection. Therefore, once the huge attack is enough to destroy the city, those locks and spell effects Stress will be generated and will be discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important point is that there is a short distance from Aalto. No matter what happens, as long as the first time to destroy the "Mage's official residence", no one will find it within 10 minutes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, this mysterious chaser does not want to erase the city directly, but there are some factors that he can take care of, so that he does not dare to choose this fierce means. I didn’t play with the Archmage’s 'Hide and Seek'...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the choice of way of action, pushing the enemy’s ideas, Fernando is getting more and more Real": "Either the power of the evil spirits exceeds the ninth level, let him scruples, or only that is possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the previous "Where are the magicians at What is the secret of this city, or the cultist of the evil spirits quietly penetrated into Kufrey, holding it in his hands, and then concealing the city for the sake of confidentiality, Fernando believes that he has seen the fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the evil spirits reach the legend, in the current situation, as long as He is willing, the magicians will definitely cooperate with Him, specifically to give him 'the missionary territory', why bother? So sneaky..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, a magician has problems here, even if they can fake sounds and letters, there are always loopholes that are difficult to cover up. For example, those who send water to feed but don't enter the city, and the source of these water and food... In the case of tension, these are hard to be noticed by Aalto's magicians..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, here is only a secret experimental place for the legendary Aalto! Only they can make a city within the ruling not be suspected of being isolated from the outside world. Attracting a large number of foods with great attention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the mysterious chaser did not choose to destroy the city, it will lead the legend in the first time! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog in front of you Dissipate, showing off the entire situation in the eyes of Fernando. He can judge this point but he is caught in a more awkward situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's here." The priest's rigid voice rang in Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a clever and recovered from his own thoughts. I found myself walking through the steps without knowing it, standing in a hall filled with a death pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the halls, many people prayed slyly, there are men and women, old and young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tucker." In front of the gods. The voice of the priest became low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man in front of a black old coat retreated backwards to the priest and Fernando. He did not stand up, purely limp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the team that left the prayer, he turned and looked at Fernando: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes are confused and muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando recognizes that this is true Tucker, solemnly: "I hope to draw a group of potential magicians, Fran recommended you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately mentioned Fran and hid the information of the Greater Holm area, hoping that people would be scrupulous. Although this is unlikely, it is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, there is a potential magician..." Tucker added a tone to the word magician, calm and serene: "I already understand The true meaning of life, will never study the boring magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I am sorry." Fernando answered politely and normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if someone familiar with his character is present, he will be aware of his weirdness. How can the "Growler" not squirt Tucker's face? Faith and gods are worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Fernando’s heart was turbulent, not because of Tucker. But he has already seen the true face of the matter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things can be divided into two parts, one is that the magicians used this cult to study in secret, they blocked the city for this, and the admission is not allowed. In another part, a great mage was chased and killed in a hidden place in the city. I was dreamed by a prayer ceremony and asked for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
