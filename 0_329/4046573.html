			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s subconscious will open the storm enchantment, not letting other legends snoop, but Thrard hurriedly said: “With other spells, within the enchantment I can't project it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't dare to shake away from the Glorious Cathedral and talk to the great Arcanists such as Fernando and Hathaway. It was simply "delivery." "Go to the door", the Holy Spirit pastor is not as rich as the legendary magician, strange and unpredictable, difficult to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Fernando and Hathaway teamed up to put together a lot of magic to prevent prying, seemingly empty and flat high altitude hidden innumerable murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, Fernando looked at the air-shaped figure with bright red eyes: "You have to work with us, it is with us. Or is it a parliament?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With someone else able to speak on their own behalf, Hathaway has always been ignorant, standing quietly, and Aff From the very beginning, Rees was screened by Fernando for his perception of the neighborhood, neither seeing the figures in front of them nor hearing the dialogue between them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not that Fernando does not trust it, but that his heart name is still young, and many times the unconscious reveals the secret, and such shielding perception is tormented to others. It has no effect on the dragon, and Aphrodite has already slumbered and floated in the air with the power of Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde laughed, as the peace of the sermon: "I want to cooperate, only the two of you can't afford it. The Magic Council is high-level. The strength, or the middle and lower-level personnel, is obviously stronger than the northern heresy, but they can only shrink in cities such as Allinge, Rentat, and Kukes. They cannot join forces with the nobility to control a huge empire like the northern heresy. With its many kingdoms and principalities, there is no need to worry about the influence of the church inside. It only needs to pay attention to the defense line and the fortress. This is simply the reputation of the second strongest force in all spaces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is in a state of convergence, and the voice is loud and clear: "Because we are developing from weak to strong, we do not have the strength to counter the Southern Church at the beginning like the Northern Church, and we have the full support of the Northern nobility." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church has a large four-transmission array and legendary enchantment in five cities, such as Rentat and Cox, to ensure that once we Trying to unplug the stormy strait Nails, they can come to help in time, turn local wars into full-scale wars, and the loss to the time needs to be carefully considered by both sides, but I believe that with the development of the parliament, after ten years, the situation will be very big. "Changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A decade, you are talking about the legendary promotion brought by the new alchemy?" Thrad asked the details in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri interjected: "Yes, ten years can slightly improve the system and modify the mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, Hathaway will be promoted to the legendary peak, Lavendi, Morris, Donald, Prado, etc. The elements that have been in the Nine Rings for a long time and the Alchemist faction will also be promoted to the legend. Fernando said with conviction that he was very confident and gave a feeling of bragging to encourage confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his heart is more confident than the surface, the reason why it is not shown is to mislead Sald, no matter what purpose Sarder has, send him a little The wrong information may have wonderful effects in the future. For the big people of their rank, the conversation is also a confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde smiled and said: "Rossien is a wizard. Ten years later, the Magic Council will let the church measure the loss of more than half of the Cardinal members. It is still the countries that have been evacuated from the Straits Strait. It is expected that the Pope will be at least sixty years old, so he is not in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Although horrible, but can only use it, kill Douglas, and take what to kill Brooke and Hathaway? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, as long as the legendary Arcane masters entangled the Pope, and the narrowing of the legendary number gap, the remaining legendary magicians will inevitably let The Cardinal Mission paid a heavy price. After all, the Southern Church was enemies on all sides. It is impossible to draw all the legendary powers to the siege of the Magic Council, unless some concessions and exchanges of interest can be exchanged for the cooperation between the Northern Church and the Dark Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this may be minimal, the contradiction between heresy is irreconcilable, and they certainly won’t sit on the most powerful church and swallow magic without a loss. Parliament, in that case, it will take a long time for them to turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now he described the possible strength growth of the parliament in the ten years of Hathaway, but in fact, with the new alchemy, with the formula of mass and energy, there are two spells of "atomic fission" and "atomic fusion". The reverse cracking of the model, even if it is too much due to lack of knowledge, can not be completely mastered, he also has the confidence to promote the legendary peak in one to two years, the same is true for Hathaway, and if the neutron is discovered in advance, then Lavindi, Donald, etc. The possible promotion of the Archmage will also be advanced. If the change of the Magic Council is measured in ten years, there will be a great misjudgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saar German calmly said: "I can make the decade ten years ahead, one year later, you can be like the northern church occupying the Shahran Empire The frequency of the assassination and assassination of magicians will be greatly reduced by controlling the area opposite the Stormy Strait such as the Kingdom of Holm, the Kingdom of Burrian, and the Coastal Corridor of the North."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Pope has more than a year to restore the use of God's Fall, unless he ignores the overdraft of life, so one year is a good time node, and by that time, I will close the transfer matrix of Rentat. You don't have to be afraid that a member of the Cardinal Mission will come to the rescue in time, but from the holy city of Lance space, at least half an hour, I think your strength is enough to control the Kingdom of Holm in this half an hour. Waiting for the place to push the front to the stormy strait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando seems to have a storm in the bright red pupil, indicating that he is not calm, and Hathaway Although still indifferent and cold, the cohesive eyes also expressed her concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Magic Council, to control the opposite side of the Stormwind Strait, you must pull out the nail of the Glorious Cathedral, and the biggest problem to pull out the nail is the magic. The super-large transmission array in the array, due to the speciality of the enchantment itself, is not affected by the external space anchor, and it is difficult to shield it in advance. But now, Thrad actually said that he would close the lifeline of this church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want from it? What about the cardinals of the other four parishes and the epic knights of various countries?" Fernando controlled his eager and anxious emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde snorted: "You should have some progress in dissecting the false gods. Lucien is also investigating in the church of the Eros. You have also received his report. What do I want, are you still unclear? I want to divide the church like the Pope of the Northern Church and reorganize a Holy See with his own ideas, closer to the great Lord."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The area opposite the Stormwind Strait is a good choice. I will reform the church's program and return the right to interpret the Holy Scriptures to the believers and become the truth gods of the nobles. Teach, become the truth god of every believer, and thoroughly integrate with them. In this way, the church I control is essentially the same as the nobility. It is the object that you can rely on and unite, just like the church in the north. For the aristocrats inside them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the epic knights, for the nobility, this is also an acceptable balance before the southern church was completely destroyed. You can't abandon We will also respect them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I am doing now is to change the religious concept of the clergy through the radicals of the Holm parish. Inserting my followers, while constantly intensifying the relationship between the nobility and the church, let them hesitate after one year, so when there is a possibility of a new balance, the enlightened aristocrats will not hesitate to abandon the church and go to my arms, and Conservative aristocrats will make similar choices under the pressure of trade-offs and changes in the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cardinal of the remaining four parishes, I am now sure to draw Come over, rely on me to get secrets in the realm of the dead. After a year, I am sure to pull back one or two. The rest should not be easily expelled or destroyed. As long as the time difference is good, the epic knights will recognize The situation. And now I have drawn the 'heart of time', you have been operating in the stormy strait for so long, it is impossible to not draw to the epic knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando did not answer, It is the default Saer De speculation, several countries have been secretly epic win over the Cavaliers, but before the situation changes, they could not betray the Church, and even follow the church weisha Parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, the authority of God will be greatly reduced. Even if you can draw over the three cardinals, there will be a considerable gap between the aristocracy and the will. They are suppressed, don't you worry?" Fernando asked solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde shook his head: "I want faith, it is closer to the Lord, the rest are illusory things, if you are willing to cooperate, right When the world's origins are vowed, we must emphasize these two aspects. I will also make a promise to close the transmission line with the heart of faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrad laughed and said: "This is what it should be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice falls, the air figure that he condenses disappears in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei quietly looked there for a while, whispered: "Do you believe what he said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no loophole, it is also an opportunity to grasp, but it must be prepared for his emergency plan." Fernando carried his hands and looked at the glorious cathedral in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, after listening to David, James will kick him Kicking the dizzy, then turned to Lu Xien: "Lu Xien, you use magic to verify his confession, then I will let the neutral aristocrats and the church aristocrats verify, rest assured, he will not be punished, was twisted Death is his only ending. In doing so, it is to obtain more powerful and more realistic evidence. We will not compromise before the other party pays the price, but we must not blindly expand the face."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, wait until I verify, 'cursed angel' Gewell must be handed over to me, I still lack the material of the nine-level gold knight, maybe in the future can study the bleeding vein stable genetics And the method of inspiring, well, you can take some of Gewell's body organization and strong identification, otherwise the conservatives will 'reciprocate'." Lucien looked at the stone-like Gewell faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James couldn’t help but look at Gewell. It’s much more terrible to be taken away by the magician than the direct death, but his interest is Another statement in Lucian's words is: "The stable inheritance and stimulation of the blood? Is there a breakthrough in the parliament in this area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But I think there must be some in the future." Lucian deliberately brags and sees a hope for the nobles. As for how long it will be in the future, he has not said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James eyes are slightly bright and authentic: "Lu Xien, you are a genius in arcane research, I hope that one day you can solve this problem, well, this room It was very dirty by Gewell, and there were residual toxins and curses everywhere. We are not afraid, but the Queen will have a bad influence on them. I will suppress Russell and Camille’s 'inability to kiss' and let them Going to other rooms to rest and recover, this toxin and curse mixed things should not fade out soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You help the Queen to go down the room Wait until I 'handle' the scene, and then inform the Lord of Time to come to protect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien found that James is better towards himself, no Because Natasha had previously worried about protecting herself and worried about the relationship between the two, and even gave herself and Natasha a chance to get along with each other after the crisis of life, this may be the change of attitude brought by the assassination of the night watchman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to answer, Lucien’s face bounced slightly, received a secret message from the teacher, and the boulder pressed in his heart was completely put down, so he nodded and walked to Na Tasha side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t united my will, I use magic to help you suppress the 'inability to kiss'." Lucien cares for Natasha's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded. "Well, first help me to the room, and then guide me to use a healthy belt."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tried hard to lift her away from the wall, looking at her soft feet, and suddenly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha noticed the stagnation of Lucien, looking at him doubtfully, but just turned his head, and there was one more hand in the leg bend, the whole person Suddenly she vacated, and she subconsciously waved her arm and tried to grasp something, but because her hands had no power, she could only hold Lucan’s shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stabilizing the mood, Natasha looked up to the sky and saw Lucien with a smiley face, only to realize that he was actually picked up by him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the memory, even if she was run away by Lucien, she has never been held by a man, a kind of shameful emotion Health, a bloody face with a suspicious flush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The princess hugs" Her Majesty, Lucien is in a very good mood, this is the normal posture! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
