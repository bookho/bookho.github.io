			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemy life of the Arcane Review Committee is mainly responsible for several aspects. First, the papers will be sorted according to the keywords, and distributed to different The committee members in the field, the second is to pass the final verification results to the magician management department, and the third is based on the respective evaluation contents of the two members, the weighted average to get the final description of the surname evaluation, the final reward of the arcane points and the arcane points, four When the two members' assessment results showed great disagreement, the paper was distributed to the third gentleman for review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the previous two members protested against the third member’s evaluation, they notified all the auditors in the field and the author of the paper to hold a small meeting in an arcane Under the supervision of the Special Adviser of the Audit Committee (the members of the Supreme Judging Panel), he listened to the author's explanation, discussed the decision, and made a final ruling. As the most special organization, the Arcane Review Committee is quite loose. There is no such thing as the president or vice president. In addition to the members and their servants, the fifteenth floor has only a few mid-level magicians who undertake the work of the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has been reviewed by three gentlemen..." Alchemy life is contradictory. It seems that when the paper was assigned, there was a problem due to a small loophole. It was distributed to three audit committee members, and they reached a conclusion that was completely different, completely different from the abyss and the paradise mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it forgot its own omissions and came up with a logical approach: “Return the three audit results to Nesica, Mirina Members, Evans and Levski, and invited them to participate in a small meeting at 9 am tomorrow, oh, I have to send invitations to other members of the field and the storm to dominate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the archer of Ariel in the past few years, the chief candidate of the special adviser is of course Fernando. If he is busy with arcane research and magic creation, he will be rejected for the first time, let alchemy Life can come to invite other great arcans or legendary magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magician Management Department, Eric scratched himself in confusion I didn't have rich hair. He vaguely remembered that something happened before, but because he just listened to his colleagues, he couldn't remember it: "What happened? How could this be?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky braved the cold wind from the nearby small town to do the magic steam train, his face was already blue, and now it is full of unspeakable sorrow: "Maybe, maybe members I threw my paper in the trash..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he has encountered. He thought of using the paper as a result of the inability to pass the review. Discussing the content of the surname and investing in the journals such as "Arcane Discussion Newspaper", so that more people can see and gain some affirmation. The submitted papers are sinking into the sea, there is no news, and even the rejection letter has not been received. Later, after several inquiries, he Knowing that the original auditor saw the third of the paper and threw it into the trash can, thinking Which boring hateful arcanist deliberately cast trouble papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Eric is not sure, even if Lucien in his heart is calm and introverted, doing things elegantly, but he is also getting magic at a young age. The rare achievements in the history of the parliament seem to be normal with his age, his achievements, his strength, his status, and his arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the iron cage once again illuminates the milky white light, causing Levsky's eyelids to twitch slightly, and the wizard's management is once again in a state of stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it just that your alchemy life missed you?" Eric comforted his old friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Levsky nodded violently and could not say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light disappeared, and Eric looked up and revealed a suspected smile: "It is the result of your paper."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Levsky breathed a sigh of relief, but he just wanted to relax, and immediately became nervous. He tried to reach out and tried to retract him. He shook slightly: "Eric, you Help me to read the results of the assessment, one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric is also very curious about what will be evaluated, so there is no derogation, he very much hopes Lucian The assessment words can be sharp, not euphemistic, completely dispelled Levsky’s insistence on this road, let him return to normal life, and become the arcane master in the astrology and mathematics fields that are both optimistic about the parliament and the towers— - Talents are not bad, but they are not outstanding, but they rely on diligence and persistence to achieve achievements, and get affirmed arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results of the eight-level Arcanist, the seven-ring magician, the authority of the stars, the force field and the authority of the mathematics field Nesica are: 'If Levsky's ideal is to write a person who cannot understand and cannot agree The paper, then his ideal has been realized, even if the whole article is full of absurd mistakes, citing the evaluation I made before, please Levsky look up the window, look at the warm sunshine, look at the blue sky, This is the real world, not the geometry he imagined, so my conclusion has not changed. This is a paper with no value at all.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen To this unexpected but more astounding evaluation, Levsky's head was slightly buried, his hands clenched into fists, and the body could not restrain the slight trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric sympathized and gratified to see Levsky and continued to read:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The results of the assessment of the seven-level Arcanist, the seven-ring magician, the authority of the astrology, electromagnetic and mathematical fields, Mirina members are: 'This paper is full of bizarre, inexplicable derivation propositions, and our experience is completely understood. Deviation, like the pranks made by beginners, please don't use such papers to tease the Arcane Review Committee. There is no doubt that this is a paper that can't find a point of qualification. No, its paper format Very very qualified, but this does not help it pass the review, I don't think there can be a new geometry that is essentially different from the geometry of the tower.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leifs The base's head is buried lower. I don't know if I want to cover up the anger, despair, pain on my face, or I am ashamed to find a gap on the ground, but from the firm fists he still clenches, it seems that I can get the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Levsky felt as if he had fallen from the cliff, tried to fly, wanted to catch something, but had no ability, no chance, no eyes. It is about to fall into the abyss of despair and darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric flipped the paper and the sound of the paper was heard into Levsky’s ear. He caught the last straw to save the life, and the slight trembling of the body has become Obviously, there is a nervous flush in the ears and face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second passed, no sound, ten seconds passed, no sound, one minute passed, no sound, Levsky was here for "long" The wait was broken, and finally I couldn’t help but look up and saw Eric stone standing there, staring at the documents in my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eric?" Levsky's voice shook visibly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric seems to wake up from his dreams, dreaming with a stiff expression:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Sixth-level Arcanist, the five-ring magician, the authority of the elementary and thermal field, the Evans committee's assessment results are: 'Bold assumptions, rigorous interpretation, no loopholes in reasoning, showing us a different tower The new geometric system of geometry, if we temporarily forget the past experience, forget the intuitive understanding, forget the world outside, we will find that this is a reading, complete, real, logical and rigorous new geometric axiom system, perhaps We should call it Levski geometry '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Levski’s mouth is unconscious, his expression is solid on his face, and the nervous trembling disappears. The whole person is like an illusion and feels that he is still in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric has returned to God, watching Levsky’s eyes as if he didn’t know the old friend:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is not comparable to the important surnames of the era of calculus change, I am willing to use the calculus revolution in the field of geometry to describe the meaning of this paper. Let us thank Mr. Levski in the field of geometry. The research on creating a surname, thanks to his long-standing persistence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight has become blurred, the brain is full of fever, hear these words, especially In the last sentence, Levsky’s eyes were unconsciously tears falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric seems to be a little empathetic, tone becomes gentle:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an article A paper with both surnames, surnames, and surnames will play a very important role in arcane research, and it is of great value in discussion. It is recommended to reward 600 Arcane points and 5,000 Arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky wants to say something, but can’t say anything, suddenly his hands lick his face, crying with low headaches, so many years of depression, grievances and pain seem to Get calm, not in vain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
