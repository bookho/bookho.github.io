			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the "world of the door" to the "immortal martyrdom", there is no need to leave from the entrance and enter the other side. After a black door, there is a connection of "immortal martyrdom". The world, Tanos, Muskilllin and others all suspect that the strange ghosts are from here to enter the "door world" and survive, because they clearly carry the characteristics of "immortal martyrdom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Rhein Under the law of the monsters deliberately changing the "world of the door", when you open the black door, you see a world full of gray sand. There is a straight road leading to the depths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Lucien and Rhein understood why the legendary magicians such as MacLeod and Maskillin could not escape because of the refining process. The monster that has been moved by Viken seems to be imprisoned in the "door world", and also has the ability to change the "door world". It is calculated that this is the entrance coordinates, but it can be opened after the black gate. It is a desperate thing to discover that it was the lab that just left! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Lucien is a little scared, if the monster and Viken are mutually restrained, there is a rebellious heart, in which He can perform the "God Drop" In the case, even if it is a kind of god, I am afraid I can't escape the "world of the door", and I can only return from nothingness after a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the reason why the god of silver moon and the Lord of Hell did not dare to enter the "world of the door" to search for the legacy laboratory of Tanos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think the Pope is actually Viken, the hero of the Holm Kingdom, the king of Burrian..." Lucien sighed , Gregory I, Charles II, Benedict III, either by Wicken when he became a pope, or by Wicken, he made the projection early, and then became the pope, "and he's descended The limitation of 'only' is 'self'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray sand of the sky has not yet blown on the body, and it is bounced off by the spiritual power of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein squinted and made a way to prevent the wind: "As long as you don't let him find the opportunity to swallow the monster, it is still within the controllable range. After going back Your 'Sound of Mystery' has to increase its efforts to promote the 'Palace's Secrets', and gradually dispel the belief foundation of the Truth, and then talk about Viking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past, the Pope was too over-fired, the incarnation of the Lord of Hell, the ambition of stealing the authority of the true God, the villain who loved the little boy, what the sorcerer disguised and dressed up, all said, this time 'The Pope's Secret' is re-announced, and it seems that there is not much shock in front of it, unless there is any irrefutable evidence." Lucien is quite embarrassed, and realizes the feeling of putting a child in the story of "Wolf is coming." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucian’s sigh, Rhine couldn’t help but laugh: “Who’s calling your 'secret church’, 'historical first sound’ program is only sensational The effect, at least this time, has a complete story chain. The general public can't hear it. Isn't the cardinal group member unable to produce a little doubt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here He said quite easily: "With the general theory of relativity, Douglas has the hope of attacking the level of the gods. Once he becomes a god, Viken is even more powerful and can't destroy the magic council, so you don't have to worry. The surgery has developed so rapidly that in the future, the longer the time, the better. Even if there is evidence, there is no need to take it out at the beginning, forcing Wicken to fight back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, on the protracted war..." Lucien's cold humor, regardless of any occasion, broke out anytime and anywhere, and then shook his head: "The Lord's lord wants to be a god, there are many obstacles, such as general Many solutions to the field equation of relativity Righteousness, but I think that some of the solutions correspond to the astronomical phenomenon of the vast sky, and when we find the planet and find these astronomical phenomena, it is the time when the Speaker of the Speaker feedbacks himself and steps out to become a class god."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly calmed down, and Lucien didn't get the answer from Rhein, so he turned to look at him and found his face confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein?" In the soul connection, Lucien asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein took a breath: "What is the field equation? What is the astronomical phenomenon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean wakes up, there is no such thing as astronomical phenomenon in this world. Only the saying of the celestial trajectory is about to explain. Rhein has raised his hand and put it on the swing. He is slightly afraid of the earth: "I don't talk about arcane, I am still a good friend. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien was laughing at the moment, and at this time, a black door appeared at the end of the sand, which was wrapped in illusory ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the two was very fast, and they did their best. It took only a few tens of seconds to reach the secret entrance of the "immortal martyrdom". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The immortal chamber..." Rhein gently vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can't help but feel the tide, what is hidden inside the immortal chamber, why everyone who opens it will be so disappointed? What is the inexplicable familiarity of immortal martyrdom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the excitement, Lucien subconsciously checked the black door and then pushed it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slowly receded backwards, a quaint road that seemed to be submerged by the illusory ripples appeared in the eyes of two people. It had no patterns and no bricks. Traces, as if they are in another world, are difficult to touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe 'the guardian of the gods' is the magic that Tanos created with the model of immortal martyrdom..." Lucien inexplicably recalled the "king of angels" "The guardian of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein nodded, with a smile in the dignified tone with a surname: "It's really like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that while taking the first step, slowly walking into the water, surrounded by a faint ripple, embarked on the "immortal martyrdom." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rhein’s attempt, Lucien confirmed that the current state would not be broken down, so he was confidently stepping in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High and deep, cold and indifferent means that from the place where the body is in contact with the illusory ripples, Lucian has an illusion that he is about to melt. Suddenly, Lucien discovered that the "immortal martyrdom" in front of his eyes disappeared and spread into a boundless white cloud, and he himself could not maintain the appearance of human beings. Diffusion into a group of dense, ubiquitous, and determined in a little form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, this pervasive collapse, the "immortal martyrdom" reappears, and Lucien’s body is condensed into its original appearance, and at this time, he has At the corner of this "immortal martyrdom", standing next to the Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no connection when the soul connection has disappeared. Rhein controls the surroundings and says: "You also feel the change just now? Is it different from the outside?" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I saw that you haven’t changed anything, but I think if we change the state, it becomes a strange ghostly creature, now I am afraid that it has been completely decomposed and pervaded every corner of the 'immortal martyrdom'." Lucien found that he could talk through the purest fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine customally sorted out his clothes: "Then we move on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "immortal martyrdom", in front of it is a large hall, which is also submerged by the illusory ripples. The wall is engraved with all kinds of strange and indescribable patterns, which makes people feel dizzy and lose their intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, they have been destroyed for the most part, and Lucien and Rhein are able to withstand and quickly pass through this hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Tanos and Wicken are destroying them." Lucien had a lingering fear of the strange pattern, which seemed to absorb and devour himself. A creature of this state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland dagger: "Since the Vikings let us come, it means that he believes that under normal circumstances, we will not encounter too much exaggeration, so wait If you have any problems, don't panic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the illusory door in front of you, Lucien and Rhein once again huddled, passed the immortal martyrdom, entered The second hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, empty, nothing, just when Lucien thought that it was destroyed by Tanos and Viken, there was suddenly on the right hand side. A slight noise is emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? Lu Xien looked at the side and his spirit spread. He saw a man wearing a black double-breasted long dress in the corner. He was handsome and gentle, and his black eyes were smiling. It was himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart was condensed and decided not to take care of it and go straight to the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien" smiled calmly, muscles bulging, the moonlight was smooth, and the silver-gray long sword was pulled out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m afraid it’s as if I can cut off all the swords, Lucien can’t help but use the moon clock and teleport magic, but at this time, He remembered the embarrassment before the Rhine, decided to wait a second, anyway, there are spells and so on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jian Guang flashed, "Lu Xien" crossed with Lucien, without any intersection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is an illusion! If you do it, the illusion becomes a real person, and the real person becomes an illusion, staying here forever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine also encountered a similar scene, but his enemy is an indescribable monster, let him subconsciously think that it is the "real guard" of immortal martyrdom. Fortunately, he also converges on emotions and prepares to fight monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the hall of the illusion, Lucien and Rhein successively passed four "immortal martyrdoms" and arrived at four different halls, each of which There are traces of destruction<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the two face each other. If you encounter a real enemy after passing through the Hall of Fantasy, you may be prepared to be hard again, maybe it will be dangerous. True and false entanglement is the most troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pushing the door of the front hall, Lucien’s eyes widened. Is it a forest? Green and green, the forests where many animals travel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not like the realm of the dead, not like the immortal martyrdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is it an illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the forest, Lucien looked around and was ready to look for an exit, and the sound of a "squeaky" sound suddenly sounded in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat? Lucian looked at the side and saw a dark, black-eyed kitten looking at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein?" At this time, Lucien found out that the Rhine was gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The cat screamed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien asked thoughtfully: "Do you know the whereabouts of Mr. Rhein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sound exit, Lucien only heard the same "beep". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on? Lucien found out that he was wrong. He immediately examined himself and found himself becoming a cat, a yellow-and-white kitten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the opposite side Mr. Rhein?" Lucian looked back and looked for the place to come in. He planned to quit first, but sadly found that the entrance was gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just writing a word exchange on the ground, Lucien suddenly felt that his neck was tight, he was lifted up, his hands and feet struggled but had no effect, he thought The magic of display can't be shown, the same is true of the opposite Rhine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sinister woman laughed and said: "You two thieves who stole food have been caught by me? You will be my dinner tonight!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought, this should not be such a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm! calm! Lucien told himself so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the woman caught a log cabin, Lucien and Rhein were still looking for opportunities in the future, and she took out a sharp knife and cut it around her neck. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the pain came, Lucian almost fainted and watched the blood drop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pain should not be an illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to resist, but it seems to be a little late, after two struggles, "Lu Sien cat" can not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
