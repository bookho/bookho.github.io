			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the adjustment of the lock, the light is getting brighter, and a new day at the Heidele School of Magic begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie, who dared not sleep and couldn’t sleep, heard the crisp sound of the "human bone wall clock" and immediately bounced from the bed and rushed to the bathroom. Shouting loudly: "Sami, Carl, get out of bed! Today, Mr. Felipe's open class is too late, but even the door can't enter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The so-called open class is naturally open to all apprentices, as long as you can grab a position in the lecture hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie doesn’t want to be awakened in the middle of the night, just go to the teaching tower where the lecture hall is located, but he knows clearly, after the morning, go to the academic affairs. In the period when the tower "human bone wall clock" is ringing, no one can get close to the three magic towers of the core of the college except for a few high-level instructors with authority: one is the teaching tower, the other is the experimental tower, and the third is the teaching tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these days of communication with previous seniors, Donnie heard that many of the three night magic towers of the mage became zombie guards. s story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we didn't cause any movement through the entire college, it was just a nightmare..." Downey thought silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Carl fell asleep, his expression was very ignorant, and after he had finished his hair, he regained his brilliance after clearing his eyes like a gem. He jumped out of bed and knocked on the metal railing of Sami's bed, urging him to get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami screamed at his head and didn’t remember what happened yesterday. Suddenly, he snorted and patted his back. Ghost, slightly nervous: "Karl. Don't forget to pass the message out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, my memory has always been good." Carl said with a fist. There is a toothbrush in the mouth, and the white foam is covered with a corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony's wash, pick up the notebook that he carried with him, and then slap his head in a big way: "Jones, let's go together." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You finally remembered me." Fat Jones’s expression was quite moving. "Sure enough, it still has to be recorded in the notebook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Carl stood in front of the full body mirror and finished his shirt. Not too satisfied with your teeth. No matter how strange his expression is, he can't get rid of the feeling of "beautiful and moving". "My father once said that it is below the high level. No matter how good the memory is, it can't match the 'record'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts on the magic robe. Go straight outside the bedroom. While opening the door, he shouted: "Remember to help me line up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Downey also put on his magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Karl leave, the bedroom suddenly fell into an unspeakable silence. Whether it is Downey, or Sami and Jones, they have a lingering fear of last night's nightmare. If the background of Carl's exhibition is amazing, they can't even get the most basic calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, you can't hear Mr. Felipe's speech later." In the end, Downey broke the strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Sami said with a swollen eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So many people so early?" Just entered the teaching tower On the first floor of the hall, Downey was shocked by the heat waves and noisy voices. There was still a full hour and a half from the beginning of the open class. There were actually two or three hundred people lined up here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the head of the crowd, Sami shook his head and was amazed: "The human bone wall clock just sounded, we got up, they Why are you earlier than us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they didn't brush their teeth, wash their faces, maybe they finished it all before the 'human bone wall clock' rings, listen To the bell, go straight to here." As a secret reporter, Jones is also very knowledgeable and experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blown Jones has been numb and shrugged: "I am yours..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t finish talking, he saw Sami carelessly Over the side, chatting with the ghosts behind, no matter who you are! Or, he thinks the issue is not important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, we are not bad." Don’t take note of Jones’s "grief" Downey, "The lecture hall can accommodate 500 people, our current position." I can definitely go in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Jones said with great gratification, this was exchanged for the nightmare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, there are queues outside the lecture hall, no more open space, late apprentices and magicians. They can only look at the crowd inside with annoyance and leave with reluctance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Carl came in from the outside, obviously shocked by the people in front of him, then he was agile, his pace was light, like a small fish The ground swam in the gap of the team and quickly approached Downey and others. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices behind Downey saw Carl’s intention to jump in the queue, and they were all angry, but they just wanted to open their mouths and reprimanded, and they saw Carl look up and smiled: Excuse me, my friend helped me to line up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile, with apologizing and shame, with a bit of pity and gentleness, suddenly, that group The apprentice’s eyes were wide and his mouth was unclear: “No, it’s okay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl turned and lowered his voice to Downey, Sami and Jones: I have already sent the news out, the fastest afternoon, at the latest tomorrow, we will be able to get analysis and advice from professionals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Carl Downey said sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four did not speak again, each immersed in their own thoughts until the door of the lecture hall opened, and the crowds in front began to follow the sequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it’s not too late, Carl and Downey’s position is in the middle of the hall, and they can see the front podium more clearly, but not outside the door. There are few magic apprentices and mages who have no place to stand there and try to listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the other side of the small door slammed open, a tall, thin man in a black trench coat with his hands in his pocket came in, he Gently coughed twice, the face of the sick, the expression was indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe is exactly the same as the newspaper," Downey whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe does not like to be exposed to the public, so he rarely accepts interviews with TV news and invitations to TV shows, and is more willing to choose newspapers or radio stations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl whispered: "I don't know if his level of arcane is the same as that described in the newspaper..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know?" Downey asked strangely, with his background. This reputation is loud, and the legendary sergeant should be the focus of attention. Hey, how did Mr. Felipe wear the badge of the Arcane Review Committee and the badge of the "Pale Hand", not like the normal magician? Wear Arcane and Magic Badge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr shook his head: "I don't have such a good arcane level to judge his papers and research results. My brothers don't like to discuss his affairs. However, he can get so many honors, he must be very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe looked around the apprentices and magicians on the podium, eyes Sweep the place. Quiet and silent immediately. Then, he said in a gloomy and special voice: "I am Felipe, you can call me Mr., or you can be my mentor. Today I am here. It is to show you the latest and most advanced theories and achievements in the field of genetic factors. You don't have to understand, but you can't help but know. Otherwise, you will only rot like a corpse in your life, and you can't make any valuable results..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Downey listened intently, not allergic and sharply aware that Mr. Felipe’s gaze seemed to pause on his own side. Of course, this pause was incomprehensible and made Downey think it was an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe is completely different from other instructors. Other instructors are talking about sharing the latest knowledge with us, and he..." Sami Let the ghost behind you massage your forehead and try to keep yourself awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deepening of Felipe's speech, everyone began to immerse themselves in the magical field of genetics, including chromosomes, genetic models based on the results of alchemical reaction analysis, and how to inherit, how to inherited the conjecture and various experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices and magicians present do not understand most of the content, but because of the secrets of life, they feel that this field is magical and high-end. Therefore, the heart is yearning for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My speech is here, what's the problem with you?" Unknowingly, the time was close to noon, and Felipe re-opened his right hand into his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices and mages have just returned to God, and in the future they will raise their hands and they will hear the magnetic male voice: "I have a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey looked at Carl sideways and saw his right hand lifted up high, and the notebook in front of him was full of text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe gently daggers, the tone is plain and plain: "What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Karl stood up in excitement and shouted: "Hello, Mr. Felipe, I am Blaise, I want to ask you, what do you think about the current genetic model? I personally don't... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie reluctantly pinches his forehead, his eyes turn to the front, and he does not know Carl's appearance. According to his experience, Carl will definitely be one. Big pile. At this time, Felipe did not wait for Carl to finish, and replied directly: "Obviously, we are so rich in features and the whole world is gorgeous and colorful." It's not that this simple model can describe and be able to inherit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people taking a breath, Mr. Felipe is directly indicating his attitude, right Dissatisfaction with existing genetic models? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol’s words didn’t say it, the whole person seemed very uncomfortable, so he asked again: “That, Mr. Felipe, you think about the manipulation of the genetic level. Can you change your looks? Can you do it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe interrupted him again: "There is no problem at all, in fact, the ancient magical empire Blood vein research belongs to this field, but they have no theoretical guidance. They can only rely on a large number of human experiments to accumulate materials and refine the laws."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carl expression is slightly distorted, It seems as if I have a sigh of relief: "I still have a question..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please give the opportunity to others, you have asked two questions." Lippe said unceremoniously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl had to sit down in a sullen manner, his mouth constantly flipping, seemingly silently talking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a scene, Downey couldn’t help but smile, but he couldn’t stop Carling’s pulling, but he’s hard to see him. What it looks like now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he also raised his hand and waited for a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the public class, Felipe sat alone in the church tower In the secret room, the "artificial intelligence" in front of it is playing all the pictures recorded in the past three days - after the development of "artificial intelligence" and alchemy storage materials, the locking function of the lock is greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dimly lit picture, the entire college is in order, and in the evening, there is no silence, Felipe carries a red wine glass. Looking at the back of the chair, watching these things intently, without letting go of any detail, but after half a day, he still did not find a place to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the door was lightly ringed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Felipe asked in a concise manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe, someone sent you a note." The waiter’s voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe "Well", the door opened, and the waiter came in and handed him a regular note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
