			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of illusory colors, the new Pope Anasta in the super-large transmission array, the king of angels, Mecan Tron, and the head of the Templars Mormos and others disappeared in Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the transmission array is gradually dimmed, Hathaway’s consistently indifferent voice has been mixed with a little complex emotions, clearing the earth: <br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elemental decomposition." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the ultra-large transmission matrix that was severely damaged under the eternal blaze was completely decomposed into many elements, or deposited or dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This southern church ruled that the fulcrum of the area opposite the Stormwind Strait finally disappeared, marking the official departure of the Southern Church forces from the Straits of the Strait and the North Coastal Corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, if it is not heavenly grace..." Oliver was a little sorry for not expanding the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante’s illusion and curse are almost useless under the purely violent “eternal blaze,” so it’s quite embarrassing, but he looks good. Self-satisfied, eyes closed again, hehe smiled: "Oliver, greedy but will be exploited psychological loopholes, one of our seventeen legendary magicians did not lose, they took control of this side of the stormy strait, won six The epic knight's rebellion, the strength is greatly increased, what is not satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this sentence is valid, because "Transformation Master" Ellie The card came back, "Herarch of the Monarch" Hercully returned, "The soul of the dead" Vicente returned, "The Hammer of the Void" Bedrenka on behalf of the sincerity of the Kingdom of Burriana, in the distance The "night walker" is also coming together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the legendary power that the parliament can mobilize reaches twenty-three, truly surpassing the nineteen legendary dark parliaments, and the legendary peak The strongest, the organization and the cohesiveness are far more than - even if there are only 18 legends, other forces regard the magic parliament as an organization that exceeds the dark parliament, because the dark parliament is a super loose alliance, blood family And the werewolves can't wait to beat each other's brains, and the Taikoo dragons are so proud that they look down on any race other than the blood race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Northern Church itself has only fifteen legends, of which the only Pope is the legendary peak, with a short-term power close to the level of the gods, weaker than The Magic Council, but the Shahran Empire and other northern kingdoms and the Principality have a total of twelve epic knights. The whole force adds up to twenty-seven legends. In general, it is more than the previous Magic Council, and now, because of the legend The peaks are scarce, they are not as good as the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the Magic Council and its controlled areas became the second real force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver had not had time to answer, and he saw the creator Davy, who was back in the group of the Golems. He was a thin and slightly sluggish "young man." "Only when he sees things like the magic images he made, he will have a feverish color." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davi slightly smiled and said: "Let Stone run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he Adding another sentence: "I was shocked by the fall of the Pope. I have not returned to God. He immediately ran away, and the Knights of the Holy Grail were controlled by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Knights of the Holy Grail handed Natasha, this is a prior commitment, she will let Richard transform them into the Wang Li Guardian Knights, if those knights can not be transformed, then ..." Douglas has little mercy to the enemy "Oliver, you and Davy are going to catch up with Shidong. Although he may have escaped far away and can't catch up, your main purpose is to give him pressure to prevent him from ruining along the way."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Oliver regrets that he did not personally kill a member of the Cardinal, and he was so excited that he pursued Davi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lentat over the sky, suddenly become quiet, as if before the gods drop, and the eternal blazing battle is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, Douglas slightly sighed with a sigh, breaking the silence: "This action was supposed to degrade one or two legends, but I don’t think of Thrall. Germany gave us a surprise. If he did not consume the first god of the second god, the silver moon and the abyss would probably wait for us to consume."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"I announced that the 'Mushroom Cloud' project was successfully completed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding Douglas’s final announcement, the post-war silence was completely eliminated, becoming lighthearted, to the magician For example, this means that they no longer have to worry about being assassinated by the night watchman at any time, and no longer have to worry about being an enemy next to the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sees the atmosphere active, hehe smiled: "Heather Wei, you let the magic division of Holm branch match the reasonable Chad to gather the priesthood in the kingdom Personnel, to be included in the new church, can not let them collapse on their own, and will be able to conduct joint research projects with the Holm State Organization in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea Servie nodded and told the magician of Holm's branch through ancient communication techniques. At this time, the electromagnetic environment was quite disordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Douglas looked at Vicente, Holt, Erica, Atlante, Helen, and Hercuri: "I and Fernando Others have always tolerated the existence of pale hands, elemental will, the singer of the silver moon, the house of the wizards, the house of Palmera, and so on. I hope that one day, you can contribute to the parliament, this time you The penetration of the respective countries is very successful for the epic knights. I hope that you will be able to guard their respective scopes and prevent the church and other enemies from succeeding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The only requirement is that the presidents and vice presidents of each division will be appointed by the highest panel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prestigious Douglas Sheng Zhiwei made a request, but he indirectly acknowledged the influence of several organizations on their respective spheres of influence. Therefore, legendary magicians such as Vicente have no objection to the convergence of some powers, and they themselves are members of the highest judging panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, I and Atlante will take turns to guard the Principality of Calais." Elika took the lead and stated that the other legendary magicians also promised, just like the church. Divided into different "parishes" to maintain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Night Walker" Winston received the following aristocratic message, understood their unanimous choice, and smiled on his face: "Huo Erm is the safest place, I have already foreseen my ease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the current level, the tradition that the previous magician could not enter Nexel Palace will definitely It was broken, so that Hathaway and Davy would also take care of the outer defense of the Necker Palace when they looked at the will of the element and the Royal Tower of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short meeting exchange ended, the legendary strongmen left, and Hathaway and Winston will descend to the hall of the Noble House because there are still some things Not resolved yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha retracts the "Sword of Truth" and looks at Winston Road: "His Lord Winston, Lord Ketonia?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He refused to cooperate with the parliament and fled Lentat." Winston tells the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the Duke of Ketonia suddenly became pale, but mixed with some luck, the ancestors at least did not die, their situation will be much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha licked her lips slightly and turned to look at the nobles: "Now, I am asking for a murder case against the former Crown Prince Patrick. Murder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the nobles looked at her with horror, not understanding what was going on, the Duke of James and others were worried, and finally got to this point. ? Ketononia has not been removed yet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha took the bleeding meat and different test reports: "This is the flesh and blood of my 舅舅 Patrick, according to the magical identification of the cell, you can find his death The age is at least two years older than his official age. The test comes from the pale hand and the elemental will, objective and fair, so I have reason to believe that the Patrick Crown Prince died of murder and died of time-accelerated murder!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing her words, the murderer did not say it, the Duke of Ketonia shook his head: "I don't know, I don't know anything, really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not look at him, but looked at the Duke of Rex: "And in the Nexus Palace, only three people witnessed everything, one is Sarde. One is Ketonia, and the other is Duke Rex. Therefore, I propose to the House to let the Duke of Rex cooperate with the investigation of the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"What? Is it a grandfather?" Natasha was emotionally unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles are almost the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Rex smiled more than he cried: "His Majesty has always wanted to return to the embrace of the Church of Truth, and the Prince's Highness has long been, long ago..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say it, but sighed: "As a nobleman, watching his lord murder but not stopping, but to make perjury, I have been It’s very tormented. It’s a lot easier to say it today. I made a big mistake and will clean up, and the Queen will kneel down. I hope that you can lead Holm to a strong road.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the two legends have not had time to stop, Duke of Rex's eyes lost color, softly fell to the seat. Natasha sighed slightly: "The crime of the Duke of Rex is not too heavy. He committed suicide, so the punishment for the Fronborg family is as follows, the Duke The title was reduced to the Earl, and the territory and property beyond this range were withdrawn. Can you have any objections?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Her Majesty returned the jurisdiction to the House, but Ray Kex has died, and punishment is not too heavy for relative crimes. Therefore, regardless of the enlightened faction or the conservatives, they all expressed their approval and let the proposal pass smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Natasha looked at the Duke of Ketonia: "Epic Knight Ketonia murders the Crown Prince case, the evidence of the person is there, what do you want to say? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ketonia swallowed a sip and said: "This is what he did, I really don't know, no one in the family knows." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles suddenly became nervous, worried that the Queen would be too aggressive to let Ketonia run away, so that she and the members of the Holm royal family would be very dangerous, even tired of her Friends and subjects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled slightly with sorrow: "According to the Code, sentenced to the hanged by Ketonia, deprived of all the titles of the Ketonian family, and recovered the land and property. The immediate members were sentenced to 10 years in prison. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not propose exile, it was simply to let them meet with Ketonia and re-establish roots in the North. germination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This treatment is the most fair, the nobility has no opinion, the only problem is that the death penalty, Ketonia, has not yet been brought to justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha once again pulled up the "Sword of Truth" and issued a charge order:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kotonia will be executed by me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her goal for herself, and she will never compromise on her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally she could be more harsh on the Ketonian family, but she knew she was not alone, had a father, had a lover, had an elder, had a family, could not The surname is awkward, and she does not think that it is the spirit of the knight to be involved. At this time, Richard came in and said to Natasha: "Majesty the Queen, the Cardinal and the Bishops have sent them to the cities of the Kingdom to gather others." Clergy. I have several religious bills that I want to pass by the House. After all, the new sects will be closely integrated with the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will print the documents Look at the nobles." Natasha nodded. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the documents, the nobles quickly turned around and found that they and others enjoyed a lot of church rights, so they voted without any hesitation, and were chosen by the nobility. The new House Speaker, the Duke of Sorenfen, reads: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Her Majesty, her descendants and successors, all future kings of this kingdom, should be held, The only supreme leader who recognizes and is known as the Holm State in the world should receive and enjoy all the rights and glory of this honour, including the supreme jurisdiction of the clergy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissipated, Natasha’s face was exhausted and sentimental, and her cockroaches were actually ordered to be killed by her grandfather. It’s a cruel and unacceptable thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
