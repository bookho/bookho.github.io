			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" The little girl named Hathaway squirmed and wanted to get up a little, but her hands were still holding the giant sword and not loose. It seems that this is the most important thing for her today, so she couldn't stand up on the elbow alone, and she finally got a little higher and fell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again and again, Hathaway never got up, her knight teacher just looked around, didn’t say a word, as if telling her, Others can't rely on it, only the one is the only way to rely on the Knights' Way. Gradually, Hathaway's indifferent but good-looking silver-gray eyes seem to have a faint mist, but she bites her red lips and wrinkles. With a delicate brow, there was no pain or sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene makes Old Green feel a bit unbearable, hoarse voice: "Sharp..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He just shouted a name, and Douglas, who had been quietly watching, suddenly spoke softly and slyly: "There is something that is temporarily put down to better pick it up, don't put pressure on yourself."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei looked up, the misty silver-gray eyes looked at Douglas without looking at it, and seemed to be trying hard to think about what he meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "Death holding the great sword, of course, can't stand up, haven't seen your stupid child!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, yes, mission!" Hathaway smashed out a word and a word, I don’t know if I was gnashing my teeth, or I didn’t know how to arrange the word order reasonably, so I could only follow the habit of thinking. break down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not angry: "You first throw the giant sword on the ground, stand up and pick it up, or you can coordinate with your limbs, you will always Don't think about standing up again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw where Heather's real problem was, but he said it mercilessly, and at the same time, his heart was silent. Make up one sentence, and your ability to express your language! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri’s face squinted again, and again, except for indifference and stubbornness, she did not see a little expression, and she did not listen to the implied temptation of Fernando. Proposal, but still continue his efforts, prop up again and again, fell again and again, finally, after experiencing many failures, she squatted and then erected a giant sword to Support, slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Old Green’s face reveals a hint of excitement: “In addition to the color of the eyes, she still has the perseverance in his blood!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, otherwise I won't take this task, even if the big man personally arranged it." The Knight teacher named Sharp smiled, a little gratified, and a little bit Feeling, the beautiful blue eyes are like the sea without wind, and the silence is like sapphire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's white face was stained with a few stains, and the neat bangs became messy. She picked up the giant sword and looked at Fernando sideways. I didn’t say anything, and I didn’t say coldness, but that cold eyes made Fernando’s face black and muttered: “This kind of small thing depends on constant trials, success opportunities, and other things. This stupid practice will only make you die a few times before, and there is no possibility of a newcomer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather’s expression is unchanged, and the eyes turn to Douglas. The legs are slightly curved: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is soft and tender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strength and never give up is a good quality." Douglas praised one sentence first, then continued, "but also know how to recognize your own mistakes, persist, not The representative should insist on the mistake, but should strictly consider and deal with the problem according to the objective facts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri seems to understand the nod, nodded, holding the giant Sword, stumbled and walked to the Knights of Sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp smiled and said to Old Green: "You have a philosophical guest here, I am only a cardinal level theologian." He has heard similar words, but his meaning is just the opposite. Persistence is to uphold the truth, and truth is the truth of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because not Less intelligent life has a long life, so that they have the freedom to think about some metaphysical problems. Therefore, with the term philosophy, many ordinary scholars have joined the ranks, and do not give up thinking because of the shortness of life and the weakness of life. Therefore, they are also called philosophers or thinkers. However, with the deepening of the Twilight War, as the Church of Truth gains a dominant position, all philosophers who do not conform to their tastes are dying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp glanced at him sideways, the smile on his face suddenly disappeared, the atmosphere in the lobby of the small hotel became solid, and the sound of sea water slammed out, and Hathaway's face softened and revealed a little. Looking forward to the expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough." Old Green coughed and interrupted the condensate. "Sharp, don't care about children, he always does, and Not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando, although unable to show his high-level magician's gas field, still rudely looked back at Sharp, not a little back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, hahaha." Sharp suddenly laughed. "Interesting, very similar to when I was young, looking down on others, likes to dig others, character." It’s stinky and hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and ignored him no longer, not thinking of what he had with Sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp sat on the high chair in front of the wooden bar, and Old Green gave him a deep yellow spirit with great tacit understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call! Only you still have this recipe! I haven’t tasted such a strong wine for a long time!” Sharp poured a sip and then laughed. "Since I have been beaten and killed by him several times, my mouth is no longer stinky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just seemed to have a lesson about Fernando. idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernan snorted again, but didn’t owe it, because he always understood very well, in Renttat, if you don’t have absolute control, don’t expose it. Magic power, so death is not only your own, but also companions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking a cup, Sharp turned to the little girl Hathaway: "You are sitting in a position, waiting for a piece of honey to roast fish, um, The great sword can be put down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei nodded his face and placed the giant sword on the table, then acted briskly like a deer The chair sat down and a dark blue cover book was taken from the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the book, she looked at it carefully, the indifference on her face faded away, her expression was softer, and occasionally she twitched her mouth slightly or frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes her whole person alive and lively, not as unique as it was just now, but like the kind of quieter child in this age group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anthony's acquaintance?" Fernando's eyes were very good, and he couldn't help but read the book title of the book that Hathaway saw. "So If you look at this kind of book, you will become more and more stupid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri looked up at him and then said nothing, re-headed again. Buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Douglas laughed and didn’t seem to understand Fernando’s behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and sat down next to Douglas, whispering: "Do you think this is not like Fernando? Actually, he has always been like this, his mouth is stinky. Love satirizes others. When discussing serious problems, it is very serious and violent. But it is usually not serious. I like to tease children and like to make more jokes with others. You will understand after you are familiar with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completely ignored Fernando’s glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This shows that he is young." Douglas laughed. "But for children, encourage them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland continues to suppress the voice: "Fernando used to have a younger sister. He was accidentally dead at the age of twelve, so he prefers children, but he does not want to admit it. He would rather tease. Lord..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Fernando took the table and interrupted Roland’s "selling." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Sharp listening to the constant drinking seems to be very good, and he laughed twice in a timely manner, saying that he had heard it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's turning the page slowed down a lot, as if she had heard Roland's words, so her tight face relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
