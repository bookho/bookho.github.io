			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light sigh, like lightning through the soul of Sophia, the thick fog is dispelled, a picture of memory emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know from the mouth of Ralph that the underground palace of the gorse family hides the powerful secret of the Sun King, in order to become the sole heir to the sacred Helz Empire, For the illusory throne, I chose to cooperate with the Duke of the Gorge, Ulrich, and the glory of the crown, and I have set up this amazing trap, even if I sell my good friends, even if I sell my allegiance. The Cavaliers are also doing their best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the object of cooperation has become an irrational monster. If it is not the friend Danny’s self-sacrifice, I am afraid that I have broken into the abyss of death. All ambitions, all greed, will become a void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this is that step by step to the current desperate danger is due to greed, no restraint of greed, no greed, no wonder this The mysterious magician will be greeted with "greedy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the previous ridicule of Frederick, Bayer, Alten and others Greedy sighs, and then contrasts the current scene, it is a wonderful irony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repent, annoyed, painful, pessimistic, desperate, self-abandon, all kinds of emotions entangled in Sophia's heart, but she is a person who cherishes her life very much, the desire to survive is great Beyond my own imagination, I have such a noble position, there are beautiful things chased by everyone, there is a luxurious and exquisite life, there are happy and fun things, there is a youthful age, there is my own strength, how can I die like this? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I haven’t enjoyed it yet, I want to raise the ranks, I have to get my own love, I have to live another five hundred years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts, all desires, all emotions, and this scream, Sophia pinned all hopes to Lucien on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is a horrible high-ranking magician, he is his own enemy, but at least he is sensible and able to communicate, as long as the conditions are sufficient and moving, willing Abandoning all persistence, you may not be able to exchange for the chance to survive. If you let, Sophia looked up at the "painful devil" Miranda, which was wrapped in black smoke at the entrance of the hall, watching him inhale the half-broken soul in the dark fog. With a painful and distorted face, shaking his head in fear, if you let it win, unless you break the magic array ahead of time, you will die in pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green and crystal-eyed eyes stare at the black figure, which is the only hope that I can rely on. As long as I can live, don’t lose myself, he drives Any conditions can be promised! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hope, Sophia focused on the use of spells and quickly calmed down the painful and disgusting feelings, but the new mood quickly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nervous, worried, extremely nervous, extremely worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this "painful devil" seems to be different from "greed", it is still in a state of chaos, not possessing the deceit, mystery and surprise of the seven devils, but It can be formed by the gold knight Miranda, and it can crush almost all high-level magicians and knights with nine levels of power and speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious magician has a way to defeat it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, I recalled that the previous battle, Sophia discovered that the high-level magic displayed by the mysterious magician in front of him relies on equipment, and he is inspired by his own soul. The spell is the highest, only five rings, although for a high-level magician, a magic has no effect, not to look at its level, but to see if it is suitable for the current occasion, the current battle, but also a six-ring magic Never used, it is too concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it, he is a six-ring wizard who has just been promoted for less than a year, in addition to the spell trigger, have not had time to learn a few six-ring magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Sophia’s heart is smashed again, and despair and pessimism are once again pervasive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord of mercy and mercy, please lower your strength and help him to kill this evil devil."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many thoughts and emotions have changed continuously in Sophia's heart. It seems that time has passed for a long time. In fact, from the greed of Lucien's feelings, the pocket watch in the pocket of the pocket only jumped three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midalen said in a nightmare:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, the deepest and deepest pain "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essence of the world is pain, the process of life is pain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Like a lot of pain, step by step, step by step, Lu Xen’s “star movement” in the right eye is getting more and more intense, and under the huge level gap, it can no longer be obtained in the same way as “greedy projection”. Detailed analysis can only be ambiguous: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that because of the strength of Midalun itself, the will reaches the peak of the legend, 'pain' Even if the devil produces a projection in his mind and draws strength and madness, he can't completely digest his consciousness for a while. He is still in the midst of intense engulfing. What is manifested outside is not as eccentric and flexible as greed and hatred, but heavy. It’s dull.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s also possible to crush everyone here with nine levels of power. Even if I am holding pale justice, if the speed is not enough, I am afraid that even the black fog around him has not been completely smashed, and he is killed by a blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slang of Midranden, his distorted faces in the darkness of his body, each suffering a painful opening:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The birth of life Bringing the pain of the mother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troubles of growing up can also cause unresolved pain..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ill be sick..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poverty can be painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Love will be painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aging will be painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Despair will be painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death is more painful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each The faces all tell a kind of pain, and the distortion that they show themselves is like a burst of psychedelic Bitter oppression to Lucien's mind, so he was somewhat impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't let him go this way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien forcibly concealed emotions, from I took out the same thing in the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sun-like phantom emerges in the mind of Midron, like the crown of glory, but makes the surrounding black air thin, let that one Zhang’s painful face is hard to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a conflict between the blood of Miladren and the power of the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Opportunity!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you miss this opportunity, there is no such thing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien When the machine is upright, throw the test tube in the hand, and recite the hard mantra in the mouth, and the complicated spelling gesture is also made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is getting brighter and brighter, it seems that the whole hall is enveloped, so that everything is turned into smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia’s eyes are slightly picked up, and the inner heart is sorrowful and desperate. Under the glory of the crown of glory, is there still hope for survival? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal test tube is tumbling in the air, and the inside is a solid, colorless thing, emitting a deep chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the spirit of the spell and the gesture-driven spirit, this colorless solid twisted and squirmed, taking the meaning of deep cold, and soon became A long, lustrous ray, like a whip, was drawn to Midranden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
