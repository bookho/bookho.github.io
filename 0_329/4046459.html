Lucien did not hide, always answered with a smile . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s mouth smacked: “It’s really a point of inspiration for the surname, I don’t think any arcane master is willing to accept such inspiration.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy sub-hypothesis is based on the fact that he and Lucien rule out the possibility of other explanations, so after the initial resistance and shake, he is the most accepting of this hypothesis, even if In this way, he only used it when analyzing blackbody radiation, and never thought about extending it to other fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he muttered and complained: "Do you want to build your own system with quantum hypothesis?" Since it is a continuation of the energy hypothesis, it is not so subversive. As long as Lucien is not experimentally confirmed by this hypothesis, it will not make a big impact. There is no need to be an enemy, fearing that he will destroy the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip turned over, Fernando’s expression became more serious and dignified: “Although in the study of blackbody radiation, I began to use quantum hypothesis to deal with energy absorption. And the instant process of launch, but still do not agree to extend it to the existence and spread of the entire light, Brooke's electromagnetic equations have well explained this aspect, if not necessary, do not add more assumptions." Brn/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not a firm wave of supporters, but any arcane master who is good at electromagnetic magic will feel heartfelt about the Brooke equations that are like goddess poetry. Shocked, deeply sympathetic to it, facing the light quantum hypothesis that seems to directly challenge the Brooke system, he still made a heartfelt resistance, even if this assumption succinctly and beautifully explained the photoelectric effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, even the open arcade masters like the teacher could hardly accept this point of view of the surname, and Lucien did not accidentally think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s closing the paper is still so serious: “But this is the best explanation I have seen so far on the photoelectric effect, if you spend time improving magic Array, accurately complete this experiment, use experimental images, data to confirm your hypothesis, may be more acceptable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't design now Such a precise experiment." Lucien did not say that if there were incidental experiments, at least some of the arcans would know that the world was broken or injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Fernando read the paper, he was very impressed with the requirements of the experiment. After hearing the words of Lucien, he did not think too much, quite harshly: " Even if I don't agree with your point of view, I can admit that I have a very inspiring surname in the whole process, and explain the photoelectric effect reasonably and succinctly, so that people who see it will inevitably have a sway, leaving this in my heart. The deep impression of the explanation, however, your last instantaneous surname is expressed as a particle, and the average is a description of the wave characteristics. It is too weak, too much, and people feel that even you can't firmly support the light quantum hypothesis, trying to fluctuate Said to coexist in a funny way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is actually my true point of view, otherwise it is impossible to explain the phenomenon of diffraction and other waves, nor can it explain the photoelectric effect. Lu Xi'an said boldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a look at Lucien: "Whether it is a wave or a particle, what state should it exist? For example, the quantum effect you assume divides light into one One copy, it seems to be a form of combination, but why don't you think about it, why can so many light quantums show the wave's special surname as a whole? Who stipulates that it should follow the wave form when it spreads?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Knights have charged you? If there is no command, no training, the assault will definitely be scattered, unable to present a certain formation, and after rigorous training, With a qualified command, they can rush into the enemy team like a sharp triangle, and a part of the quantum of light is strictly trained and commanded, in order to spread according to the characteristics of the wave? Is it the god of truth? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you ever thought about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are the most proud and satisfied The student, Fernando also picks the wrong one, and almost squirts Lucy. A look of saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need for strict training, no need for someone's command, it is a wave itself, naturally it must show the characteristics of the wave. Teacher you are from the perspective of particles Departure, to explain why the surname of the wave is presented, I think it can't be like this, it is a wave itself, and it doesn't need to start from other angles." Lucien seems to be sincere and honest, can hear Fernando's ear, but is almost entangled, exists form Can be beyond imagination, but also must be built on the ability to explain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is also a quantum of light itself, and it doesn't need to be from a wave point of view." Lucien still uses this kind of mouthpiece that can be called "mysterious and mysterious" by some people in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lu Xien did not think about confronting the teacher now. There are countless thresholds in this research: "Teacher, this is just my own." The point of view has not yet been written."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently daggers his face, he allows students to have all kinds of whimsy, and finally as a thesis or achievement There must be a rigorous inference or a mathematical description: "The paper looks more lovely than your true point of view. I don't want the study of arcanes to become a philosophical speculation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he knocked on the table: "There is no experimental proof of submitting this paper, you have to be prepared to be attacked by most arcans."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, if you can't come to a conclusion, they will forget this question in a while." Lucien answered with disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at him and shook his head: "You don't underestimate the obscurant's attachment, someone will keep chasing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the office of the Arcane Review Board, Lucien saw the table A paper suddenly frowned. Since I reviewed the papers of Levsky's new geometry system and indirectly contributed to his award of the Arcane Scepter Prize, there was some arcane. The teacher submitted his own "subversion surname" paper, trying to get affirmation from his own member who likes to subvert the surname and revolutionary surname papers, and became famous in one fell swoop and won the highest honor in their respective fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of these basic logics are contradictory, the process of deduction is terrible, but it claims to overthrow the Brooke system and overthrow the Douglas system papers, Lucian really wants Tear them off, throw them on the face of the submitter and scream at them "Folk Arcane Masters"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell yourself that you can't be biased, you can't have a preconceived attitude, and Lu Xien opened the paper and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s worse than before, even if the theory he wants to overthrow is not understood, he begins to say that there is contradiction here, there is contradiction, here and certain system Inconsistent, there is a violation of logic and common sense..." Lucien suddenly felt that the previous committers became cute, at least they were miscalculated based on the theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can be a joke..." Lucien picked up the feather pen and changed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magician Management Department, Eric’s rare eyes are sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a black-eyed, blue-eyed, good-looking man in his thirties who is talking about it: "I have discovered and deduced the Lord of the House of Governors after years of research and deduction. The fatal surname error of force field theory is enough to expose the seemingly sturdy armor of this theoretical system, pierce its weak inner, and free all the Arcane divisions of Parliament from the mistakes of hundreds of years."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a magician who specializes in electromagnetism. How long does it take to study force field theory? Eric doesn't want to say anything more, consider how to ask him to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the members of the Audit Committee are blindly obsessed with authority and have no idea of ​​their own ideas. They cannot see the value of my theory and cannot see those fatal surnames. Wrong, fortunately, there is a member of the Evans Committee who is young and daring to question everything. I think he can certainly read my thesis, face up to those mistakes, and return the honors and praises I deserve." The man said quite proudly and confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric touched his sparse hair: "Pivi, there are other magicians waiting, you have three days to get the results." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pivi shrugged his shoulders: "It’s a pity, I am going to tell you about my theoretical system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the white light on the iron cage lit up and a document appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Pivi, your paper?" Eric shouted Pivi, who was leaving the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pivi was pleasantly surprised: "Ivans members appreciate my paper so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
