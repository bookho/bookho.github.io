			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the filthy cold wind, a human form quickly became clear, and his appearance was exactly the same as that of Benedict III, wearing a similar pope gown, but The color of the clothes is dark, and the crown worn on the top of the head has no sensation of sacred transcendentality, but the end of the fallen, the ultimate pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dark scepter in his hand, with a hint of the "God of Truth", and a seven-layer of seemingly pure light. The "projection" of the paradise mountain, the "projection" standing upside down, is like a pyramid with a spire down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this strange "Paradise Mountain Projection", the creatures and angels do not play the piano again, praise and share happiness, but each layer presents a different Scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top and the widest layer, the Holy Spirit and the angel smile, but the hands and feet are deliberately extended, squatting at each other, even secretly attacking behind companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next layer, angels and the Holy Spirit seem to have desires, and the delicate faces are full of rich springs, wild and melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One layer after another, different negative emotions such as jealousy, arrogance, hatred, etc. The devil infects the angel and the Holy Spirit, until the lowest layer is no exception, boundless The infinite light is like the pain and despair without end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster" Viken deliberately contrasts his "face", "dressing" and "power" with the "Pope" Viken's current image In order to find a way to deal with the "Pope"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true body of Mardi Moss seems to be forever hidden in a layer of invisible fog, with only two sharp devil horns and those bright red The eyes are clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, his eyes with a touch of ridicule did not change a bit, as if he had anticipated the appearance of the "monster" Viken, and deliberately slowed down. Destroy the rhythm of the "Magic Sphere" and let the projection of the nine-layered Hell be surrounded by the "monster" Viken. The volcanic volcano and the plain that freezes the soul are more and more like the essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is not in the "world of the door", Mardi Moss has no fear of the "monster" Viken, and his ancient devil character still does not affect "The Lord of the Devil"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Maldives, how difficult it is to meet the "monster" Viken's chance to play normally, which can help him find the "Pope "Vicken's weakness or accumulation of ways to deal with him, it is okay to delay a little time for this! Because, as far as he knows, the path of the gods of Viken and Tanos will take ten minutes in the final step, as long as it can be in Lucien. Evans had no big problems before it was completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼, Wicken, who fought in the sky and the silver moon, noticed the “completeness” of Mardimos, and he was ready to betray his allies at any time. The devil has no good feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame on the "Silver Moon" sword seems to burn everything, and whenever it is in the "Sacred House", it will always be attached to it. Cracked out of a gap, causing the collapse of the "Sacred House". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light of Heaven!" Wicken lifted the Platinum Scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the projection of Heaven Mountain behind Viken, the blazing angel "The Son of Light" blew the horn of the kingdom of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solemn and melodious horns rang through the sky, and the layers of heaven and mountain projected a bright and shining light. An angel flew out of the illusion. Incarnation, they merged into a sacred wave of sacred light, rushing in all directions, turning the entire sky into a milky ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ocean of the Holy Light, the bright and bright moon shines, and the cold "light" breaks the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;趁This short-lived opportunity, Viken’s body became illusory, as if there was a pervasive sign, influenced by this, the “monster” Viken’s illusion The form also produces disintegration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, driven by the power of the two major types of gods but they are positive and negative, the "ball-shaped" magic array has become difficult to operate, no longer before the light flow, the changes that can be completed in just one minute, It takes two minutes now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pope" Viken looked at the "monster" below Viken, his expression was indifferent, his eyes were cold, I was Vicken, you were just attached to My "vines", I can't get rid of you, can't you suppress you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that Lucien is hiding in the realm of the dead to complete the ceremony, I guess you will definitely miss this opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it takes at least half an hour to complete the ceremony, and how long will your strength from the "world of the door" last? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Monster" Wicken's power is suppressed, the ground is more and more like a nine-layered hell, the power drawn from the world of the dead is getting weaker, In less than half an hour, the "spherical" magic array will collapse by itself due to lack of energy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Hell" Mardi Moss deliberately suppressed the speed of the formation of "Nine Layers of Hell" and continued to attack the "monster" Viken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster" Viken is going to split half of his energy to deal with the influence of "Pope" Viken. If there is no "storm dominated" Fernando assists him, he is very It’s hard to stick to it, and the high-altitude “Pope” Wicken, the magical powers and the magical spells are endless. While suppressing the “monster” Viken through strange relationships, facing the “silver moon” is only a slight disadvantage, and it is a kind of god. One of the most powerful, and He has not used the "God Drop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After relying on the power of faith to become a god, Viken has no cognitive world, but he can indirectly rely on his own "half plane" power Magic, anyway, the spell model inscribed in the soul has never disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, even if "Lord of the Lord" Maldi Moss did not do his best, "Monster" Viken gradually became overwhelmed by himself. The world is bound to dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his gloomy and thin face showed a sneer: "You are too big, I have been dragging on for so long!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound echoes in the vicinity, broken black and white gray solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mardi Moss raised a bad premonition, the "monster" Viken suddenly disintegrated and turned into a black ink. The ground descended, and at this time, "Storm dominates" Fernando throws out a strange alchemy item, which merges with these dark gases to form a chaotically inverted door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above this door, a bright red bloodthirsty eye screamed wildly, with a loud bang, the door open, a countless piece of meat, hands, feet and eyes The messy monsters flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abyss Will"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world of the dead, and the coming of "Lord of Hell" and "The Will of the Abyss" is not as restricted as the main material world, so the "monster" dimension Willing to use some of his strength as a sacrifice, relying on the arrangement prepared by the Magic Council in advance, summoned the "Abyss Will"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the "abyss will" is an uncontrollable factor, let his advent be led by himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the monster Viking was a procrastination time, a "trap" that deliberately made Mardi Moss heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneer of Mardi Moss at the "Lord of Hell" slightly solidified, although the madman was not healed, but he did not know how to live and die, in ten minutes. It is almost impossible to knock him back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to watch Lucien? Evans shocks the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Abyss Will" just came, and smelled the most disgusting and disgusting devil, so he directly directed to "The Lord of Hell" Mardi Moss. A messy ray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken at high altitude reveals anger, if Mardi Moss has too much selfishness, he will be able to solve the "monster" Vickens ten minutes ago. Off, even if he summons the "abyss will", plus this extra time is enough to repel the follow-up attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
