			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this familiar scene, Lucien recalls the identity of the sphinx in front of him, it is the lion that he encountered when completing the Rhine mission. The king of the body, Fenix! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, it was sealed in the shackles, and after a brief resurrection, it was killed by its own righteousness, and once again fell asleep, and when he fled, he was Leaving from the gap of the dead spirit, I witnessed the black and white ash projection of its mausoleum, witnessed the bloody rust-colored light ball, and witnessed the strange red-brown "spider silk". It is clear that the place where it was actually sealed is The world of the dead. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, it is directly killed by the sword of truth along the projection relationship, no longer have to worry about being sealed, because it is completely degraded There is no way to be sealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this projection? Sacrificing the ingenuity and gaining the original strength? No wonder my 'destination meteor' can't really destroy it." Douglas said with a guess. "Destiny Meteor" acts on the ontology and will destroy all life-saving preparations, but it is impossible to reproduce the ontology along the projections, **, etc., and only cause a certain degree of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien dungly said: "Maybe not only sacrificed the reason of the intellect, I suspect that it was sealed in the realm of the dead, there is a presence to extract Its god surname is the power of the light ball, yes, it is the king of the Sphinx."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finks, died nearly 10,000 years ago That legend?” Douglas is familiar with ancient civilizations, and the mausoleum of Finks is still located in the southern desert of the Gusta Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando grabbed the focus of Lucian's words: "God's name is the ball of light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucian nodded and described all the details that he saw in the Fenix ​​Mausoleum and the Necromancer reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a few years ago, you can’t touch the strange ball of light that you can’t really get close to, Douglas, Fernando, Vicente and others don’t know what it is, but now they But no doubt to determine, this is the god name light group! Silence for a moment, Douglas solemnly said: "So it seems that Fenques was not really dead thousands of years ago, but was the one who was killed in the dead world." Caught, sealed in a specific place, with its core as the core of the surname, and slowly extracted and converted, the projection of the guardian of the Temple of the Dead is only a side effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, no wonder, before the dawn of the Twilight War, there was basically no false god in the main material world! I rummaged through all the ancient records. Nothing except the mythological era, I found no resemblance to the existence of a false god! I have always been very surprised. Since the Twilight War period can produce so many false gods, it shows that the main material world also has the conditions to condense the light ball of the surname of God, but why the newly discovered heterogeneous space can have so many false gods, and the main material world But not? The people who were in the realm of the dead spirit spy on everything behind them." Fernando snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika wrinkled a thin eyebrow: "You mean, every legend or powerful creature that might condense the name of the light ball is killed." Is the spirit world eyeing? Let them die 'naturally' when they are almost successful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost like this, I see the report submitted by Evans. The mysterious existence of the dead spirits has been restored by swallowing the light ball of the same surname and surname. Perhaps the legends and vassals of the dead spirits were originally to awaken him to capture the king of the lions to seal and transform God. The power of the surname." The soul of the dead dominated Vicente's voice and said coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the legend of Finks, although it does not take the initiative to collect the surname of God, but after being worshipped by all the sphinx tribes, accumulate over time It must be natural that there is a condensed glory of the surname of God, and it was noticed by the dead spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since it does not really die, the power of spontaneous faith will gather in the place where it is sealed, so that the latecomers can no longer become "spirits". In the same way, Ambola, the "owner of the sea" worshipped by the fishermen, should be the same. Even if the power of the emperor later surpassed him, he could not feel the power of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, it is behind the black hand, on the other hand, the “sealed person” monopolizes the channel of belief, which causes the strangeness of the false gods after the mythological era. The situation, until before and after the Twilight War, only a large number of people came out to spread religion and collect faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few conversations, the six legendary magicians have probably reduced this plot of tens of thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exploration is more valuable than expected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the seal rituals of the Necromancers are very good, and they can make the King of the Sphinx sleep for thousands of years without completely 'corrupting'." Si shook his head and laughed, using humor to resolve the atmosphere of a short-lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "When you go to the end of your life, you can take the initiative to apply for a seal to the legendary undead in the dead, so tens of thousands of years. After the dream you are eager to achieve, you can wake up and enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, very good idea." Crow Hehe laughed. "But now I can't care about it. I still have a long life to enjoy. There are still many alchemists waiting for me to go back. I can't be sealed in the gloomy mausoleum, and then I can project a face." The way to guard the Temple of the Dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took a breath and pointed to the hidden entrance not far from the front: "Maybe there are more horror things, etc. We explored and found that everyone must be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rotten corpse of the King of the Sphinx, completely stopped the squirming due to the destruction of the body, the tide The black beetles are all in the air, losing the feeling of life and death. Then, In order to have speeded up the gray pus, into the black soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old-fashioned dark patterns dotted with pure black doors, sparkling with anomalies The icy color is daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This entrance seems to be specially designed for the Genting Giant, which is tens of meters high, and according to Ador’s description, it should be the smallest in the palace group. Daomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many high-order undeads similar to Ador, floating inside and outside, all wearing large black hooded robes with a weird white The pattern closely guards the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas frowned slightly: "The Temple of the Dead has isolated the mental power. As soon as I enter the magic eye, I will sever the connection. It seems that it can only be deformed. Directly sneaked in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the Temple of the Dead is part of the mysterious existence of the dead world." The soul of the dead, Vicente, suddenly began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely." Fernando rarely agreed with Vicente's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, under the protection of illusion, six legendary magicians went to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Finks is watching the legend of this entrance, so Lucien and others did not encounter other strong, in dozens of high-order dead spirits Under the gaze of the red mans, the generous entry naturally, as if returning to his home, there is no restraint, and these high-order undeads turn a blind eye to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the palaces are pure black, cold and dead, all the gardens have pale faces, strange and horrified, all the corridors are completely sealed, mental strength Can't spread to the outside, there are many dead spirits in all places, rancid and unpleasant... After careful walking for a long time, Douglas said: "The front hall is not the "lake of wraith" in the memory of Ador. Explain that the location has found a change, and then we have to rely on ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there are also the rules of coordinate transformation left by Maskin and Wicken. And the place where they disappeared is confirmed to be behind the soul fireplace, so as long as you go to the calculated coordinates, you will inevitably reach the soul fireplace inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calculating the coordinates according to the parameters of the surrounding environment, Lucien et al. continued to move forward and recalculated every once in a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that the time and space in the Temple of the Dead is not normal." In front of a large hall, Douglas suddenly stopped, "as if we came to another world." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out the silver-white "monthly timepiece" and looked at it: "Yes, time and space are not normal, the second hand, the minute hand, the hour hand are jumping, it seems Every time you take a step, time and space will change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the deeper the time, the faster the time flow, now it is about one day equal to five days outside." Douglas recorded changes in the magic notebook, which is the responsibility of the “opener”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
