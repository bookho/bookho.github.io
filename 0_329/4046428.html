			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand holds down the monocle with the silver metal chain, and Lucien just wants to inspire "Fernando's electromagnetic communication" and suddenly accepts calling himself. The signal, so I chose the call in doubt, who is so looking for myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the short-lived current of Zizz, Natasha’s voice of tension and relaxation came: "Lu Xien?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I am looking for you." Lucien’s mouth unknowingly evoked a slight smile and was able to contact him when he arrived at Aalto. Natasha should be Repeated calls for dozens of minutes in a row? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, I have astrology, can confirm her safety, Natasha obviously does not have the ability to know whether she is alive or not in a short time, and at that time Pulling the possible early return, as well as the vision of the moon, makes her even more free and easy, and has confidence in her friends. I believe that I have to be full of worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Natasha vomited clearly and frankly: "I am relieved now, before Prince Dracula has not yet approached the pretender The mountain range where I chose to return, I am a little worried that you have not enough time, but it seems that you succeeded? The vision of the red moon is what you made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Involved in this matter personally, and at the time of the blushing month, Natasha, unless it is a fool, can also think of Lucien with his toes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, Lucien also vomited slightly, it seems that Prince Dracula is a mysterious connection between the first generation of vampires, only in the distance In the far-away situation, I judged the true and false, and immediately returned with a chance, and did not have contact with the pretender and Natasha, so there is no need to worry about her being cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of silver moon is my call, but why is it that I will not know the moon, and it will not be successful, I have to wait for a while. You can only know when you receive the feedback." Lu Xien can't say that he "sees the color and forgets the friend". He didn't contact Rhine at the first time. He still didn't know the realm of the dead and his condition. Of course, Natasha is trying to help herself. It is also important to confirm her safety first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a pause, Lucien smiled with an unconscious smile: "No matter what, thank you for your help this time, or else Prince Dracula is casual." Spit will kill me, but fortunately you didn't fall into it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I am a brave knight who is worthy of trust." Nata Shake interrupted Lucien’s words and was quite proud. “Don’t be jealous, where are you? I will return the deformed mask to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tasha's straightforward and acting style, Lucian is very accustomed and familiar, and quickly reported his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than ten minutes, Lucien saw Natasha, who was replaced by the white-haired knight’s armor, flew over with Camille, still in a good position. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, unfortunately this deformed mask can only change the same name..." Natasha reluctantly looked at the deformed mask when she gave it to Lucien. He seems to be imagining how he looks when he becomes a female surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked helplessly at the sky where the silver moon was still hanging, and took the deformed mask silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha just joked and joked. At this time, Lu Xi’an was reluctant to discuss the “gentleman” topic in this area, and he was not entangled. He laughed. Two voices, his face slightly solemnly said: "I heard that Prince Dracula is good at curses and nightmares. You should go back to your teacher or Hathaway as soon as possible to check it carefully. Well, it is best to find the cursed eye. He is this. Authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I was hiding in the defensive lock, and before the Dracula prince broke the squad, he successfully summoned the god of silver moon. Scared him away, without any harm." Lu Xien couldn't help but smile again, and his heart was filled with faint warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good." Natasha nodded gently, then looked at the sky. "When you summon Aitna, the silver moon solidifies and illusory. The black-and-white grey is the strange space that appeared on the shores of Lake Elsinore. Is the eccentricity of Mr. Rhein and Cardinal Salde related to it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She did not ask Lu Xi's secret plan, but asked questions and did not want to answer, but also reminded Lu Xien that she could see that other strong people who experienced the collapse of the big cross star lock should also be able to Looked out, after all, the silent world of black and white was floating out of the water. Even if "no one" finds the entrance, it does not prevent them from linking the two things together, so they need to be more careful and more confidential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Rhein and Cardinal Serge have joined forces to find the entrance to this strangely different space. As a result, Mr. Rhein was trapped in the secret of Sald's 'selling'. I am here to save him. Get out of trouble, only to help summon the god of silver moon, but the secret of the strange space is deeper than I thought. I don’t know whether it is successful or not.” Since Natasha saw many problems, Lucien did not hide it. Raised, but does not involve deeper secrets. Besides, Natasha’s unconditional help makes Lucien more trusting for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded solemnly: "After the destruction of the magical empire, although there was a war between the North and the South, there was no storm that swept across the continent. This strange and strange space that allows Cardinal and the Mr. Rhein to be seen, hides the mysterious existence that is comparable to the love of the moon, the love of the moon, perhaps the key to the beginning of another big era."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she showed a strong, confident and longing smile: "And in every big time, there will be many strong people falling, and more latecomers will emerge. At the new peak, I seem to be able to hear the sound of fighting in my blood, Lucien, let's work together to improve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I already Catch up with you, maybe when you can exceed you." Lucien deliberately "provocative." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha readily accepted the "challenge", both excited and happy: "Look at who will become the ninth level first, who will step into the legend first, if You lost, oh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She showed a bad smile and seemed to hide a little secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are leaving, there is such a big move tonight, Cardinal Sald is in the most alert state, although we are below the legendary Not necessarily their attention, you have a big arcane teacher, but it is still a little dangerous." Natasha did not know that Lucien was jumping over the space. After talking about the serious things, he urged him to leave. "And, Remember to write a letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked, he was negligent, and even jumped directly to the vicinity of Aalto, wanting not to be noticed by Sarde. Difficult, fortunately there are teachers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at high altitude, Fernando of the red magic robe looked at the deeper Sarder in front of him and smiled: "Peeping young people's dating" is immoral. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too many things happen tonight, as the cardinal of the Vaorrit Parish, I have a responsibility to protect the safety of the princess." Thrad calms No wave said. He is one of the most visible people in the event of the Red Moon, so at this time, every note of Alto's attention, every change was noticed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s old rogue is blocking it, gently sighing: “Salde, you are going to be a saint, I really want to destroy you now. Off." The threat is overwhelming, reminding him that he is not a saint! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beria they should also be paying attention to here." Thrad reminded Fernando that the Vaolirit diocese could not only have one legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he hasn’t made any difference, and the grumpy storm dominates it is really possible to do it directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stood still, looking at Sald with a smile, but his heart was dark, and Lucien was anxious to "dating". Confirming peace, there is no usual cautiousness. After forgetting such a big change, the legendary strongman of Aalto and the North Fortress must be paying close attention to everything around him. He will jump in another space, not the lights in the night, abnormal. Eye-catching? He is not afraid to be caught by Sarder and Beria? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down at the two, Fernando groaned, and usually a little smart girl, this time actually ran out, Kamir, this girl too, I was forced to let her go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, the students are not worried, can not think of these, only the teacher has worked hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he came over is not simply because of the "transfer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being snarled by Fernando for ten minutes, Lucien did After a deep review, I used the deformed mask and took the magic steam train to Rantat. I just found a hotel to fall asleep and summoned the arrival of the Rhine projection. The Aringe was powerful and the defense was numerous. The Rhine could not be projected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
