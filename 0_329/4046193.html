			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15th floor of the Magic Tower of Parliament, in another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp bells are pleasing to the ear, and a puppet jumps over after hearing the sound, then picks up the paper and flips it over: "Sonic paper? Apprentice The master has been accounted for, and it is related to high-level magic or the latest arcane field. He is also reviewing several students. Today, they can only be handed over to several auditors of the Ordinary Arcane Monthly. The master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recognizing the magic level, he waited for another five minutes, and the "bat scream" was identified and transmitted, and the puppet greeted the window. A beautiful little bird with red-billed green hair fell and tied up several papers that had been accumulated today, letting it fly down to another magic tower in Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the same magic tower, it is difficult to transfer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird flies at a very fast rate, and the feathers also produce a layer of pale green barrier that blocks the wind and quickly disappears into the puppet's line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The third floor of a sky-like blue magic tower, a pile of books, looks very crowded and messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A middle-aged man with a golden character is looking at the journal in front of him, frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning the latest research in their field is one of the main ways that their level of magicians want to go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he heard something whispering the sound of the outer energy barrier of the magic tower, so he smiled and put down the journal in his hand and pressed it on the table in front of him. A magic button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy barrier is withdrawn, the window is open, the red-green-haired bird flies in, and a few steps on the table proudly The paper puts down: "Mr. Woods, this is today's paper, please review it as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is as sweet as its tweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods pulled out a strange white grain and threw it to the bird: "Selina, is there a magic rating? If not, then take it tomorrow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selina sat on the granules with satisfaction, and said: "There is one, Mr. Woods, you can quickly check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods heard the words, untied the rope and found the parchment with the new magic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scream of the bat, the apprenticeship magic... oh, a little meaning." After the careless Woods browsed to the principles and construction process behind, the face was a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished reading, he couldn’t help but lick his fingers and knocked on the wooden table, his mouth groaning: "This, this, this... there should be corresponding The paper?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he flipped other parchment:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bat flight experiment explores the use of sound waves in the field of magical exploration? Lucien Evans? This is the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking out the paper, he read it from scratch :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...a magician with a detective spirit who has the basic Arcane potential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The past magical empire and the current magical parliament's research on biology are basically limited to magical creatures and humans. Few people study ordinary creatures. Even if it is, it is similar to the power of bears, the agility of cats, etc. No wonder no one has ever found that small bats rely on hearing rather than visual flight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Control experiment The design and elimination process is quite exciting and very rigorous. Although there is not much arcane knowledge involved, this mode of thinking and thinking mode is worthy of advocating and learning. It is very embarrassing and the spirit of exploration of the Arcane... Hey, only a lonely one. Magician? This young magician doesn't even have an arcane level? It's amazing!" He read and read, he couldn't help but turn to the front and look at the author's signature and rating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully reading the paper, Woods stood up and told his apprentice to catch two small bats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why Mr. Woods wants a bat, the requirements of the four-level Arcanist and the four-ring magician cannot be violated. Fortunately, the bat can still act as a bat. With the formula of several magic potions, he can find two in ten minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods repeated the experiment of Lucien in a short time, and the expression became more and more excited: "Really can be positioned by high-frequency echo, which makes the sound wave Magic breaks through the limitations of the past, and is no longer used only when it is shocking, destroying, and killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic magic is generally scattered into major factions, such as Homanz's cough series is the force field, and the banshee is the dead body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressed himself wants to write a paper to discuss the mood of the application, Woods sits back to the position, and lifts the feather pen to write the assessment results on the road to Lucien's paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creating a surname..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same scene also appeared in another magic tower. It has only become the headquarters of the journal "Sonic". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Sorcerer Management Department" lobby, Lucien sat on the sofa and drank a non-alcoholic drink that Lazar strongly recommended. Sky Blue, which is sweet and moist, has been liked by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transparent glass, the blue pure liquid slowly swayed with the sway of Lucien, and he lobbied and talked freely with Lazar. The common sense of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that it was approaching 5:40, when the Magic Tower near the Parliamentary Headquarters was closed, the two magicians sat in the hall without a hurry. Drinks, Cindy and Donna are very curious, so the more lively Cindy, quietly stretched his neck and whispered: "Mr. Lazar, Mr. Evans, what else do you have in the management department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar pointed to Lucien and smiled: "I accompanied Evans and other new magic assessment results, huh, and the results of the paper review. But the paper review It will take three days to come out. Cindy, you know, the gentlemen of the audit committee are big men, and they have always been 'rigorous', so they are very slow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, the gentlemen of the audit committee have their own intensive research, exploration and family entertainment.” Cindy first answered along Lazar’s words, and then looked at Lucian with surprise, “Mr. Evans’s paper?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar is definitely nodding<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy and Donna are half-mouthed, and hehee twice: "Mr. Evans, have you ever studied arcane?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Study for more than a month, although I feel that my progress is very good, but that paper is just some of the previous experience of improving magic." Lucien sipped a "sky blue." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls snorted, Cindy smiled and said: "Although the passage of such a paper may not be high, I think that the new magic will definitely be Evans. Mr. You bring the activation of the Arcane Badge, and Mr. Evans is the first person I have ever seen to join the Parliament on the day of joining the Parliament. Congratulations, you are loading the 'Cindy's History'!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting along with this lively girl will leave you with no pressure and restraint. Lucien laughs and laughs: "It’s an honor."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four young people talked and laughed for a while, Lazar took out his pocket watch and looked at it: "5:40, Evans, we went to Mr. Eric. Look at the audit results in the office and hope that you can successfully activate the Arcane Badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you can get the Arcane points for Mr. Evans." The two girls followed. blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Eric’s office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The results of the review have not yet returned. Is it true that the judges in this field of the audit committee have important things today." Even Eric’s attention to instrumentation and majesty People can't help but ask questions. Normally, the apprentice-level magic review will produce results in twenty minutes. After all, everyone knows that the committee's gentlemen will certainly not rate this level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There should be nothing, you are free to sit." After Eric doubted, he did not disturb his rhythm to take out a magic book, began to parse the magic with the help of the auxiliary magic array, and did not waste time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very calm, because it means "bat scream" passed the "magic exchange hall" review, a new magic in the standard sense Otherwise, it may take only five minutes to get back. I have at least one Arcane score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Eric’s concentrated study, Lazar’s slight concern, the office was a bit quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this atmosphere, time passes by, and seeing Lazar’s pocket watch minute hand is going to cross the third-digit limit and enter the last ten minutes. The jingle bell rang and the iron cage lit up with a white glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric turned off the auxiliary magic array, put down the feather pen, and as he got up, he shook his head and said, "It’s finally coming."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light disappeared, Eric wondered: "How do you have three documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out one and looked at it: "The bat's scream, apprenticeship magic, Mr. Garfield and Mr. Jeffrey's assessment results are: 'The application direction creates the magic of the surname, but the magic structure has serious flaws, there are many places to improve, the comprehensive level, principle Five aspects of effect, structure, and meaning, rewarding three arcane points, four arcane points '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric forgot two other moments The document, looking back at Lucian in astonishment, said in his mouth: "Create a surname? Three Arcane points? This is an apprenticeship..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the new magic of the ring rewards two arcane points, and the meaning of the name of the surname is the value of the evaluation, Eric Clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are all magicians present, and their mental strength is not low. Lazar and Lucien have heard Eric’s whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Eric, do you mean that the new magic submitted by Evans has received three Arcane points and a rating for the surname?" Lazar slightly Looking at Eric with his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is calmer, does not understand the meaning of the three arcane points and the creation of the surname, just thinking that since the magic has received this evaluation, then the paper It should not be worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric has recovered his emotions at this time, after all, it’s just apprentice-level magic, and he doesn’t know the specifics. He took a deep look at Lucien: "Yes, Evans' apprenticeship magic 'bat scream' got the reward of three Arcane points and the evaluation of the surname, it is hard to believe." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he flew the document to Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar was able to believe it after watching it over and over again, looking at Lucien: "Is this magic imitating a bat?" This seems to be the direction of ancient magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lucien answered affirmatively, "Imagining the magic of bats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lazare sighed on his forehead and said, "Is it really embarrassing? Right, Mr. Eric, is there two documents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Eric was reminded to remember that there were still two documents, so he picked up another one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression suddenly solidified until Lazar whispered and whispered: "The results of the Evans essay review came out."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?!" Lazar could not believe that the gentlemen of the committee would be so diligently reviewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s expression is a bit bitter, and it seems to remind me of the situation when my first arcane paper was submitted:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the result of the review. Mr. Garfield's evaluation is: 'Create a surname to apply sound waves, rigorous experimental design, amazing sharp observation and thinking, is a weight, Papers with research and discussion value recommend four levels of Arcane points and six Arcane points, and suggest that the authors add letters to the name to distinguish them from others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
