Lucien asked in a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum again turned over the report on hand to make a final confirmation, the sound of paper rustling was introduced to Lucien’s ear: "Monitoring them is a high The War Master and the two mid-level wizards, who did not come out after a small church in the west of Rentart City yesterday, the high-ranking Master originally thought that it was the time of Sarder and the radical clerics and The normal continuation of the vigilance of the night watchman did not care. Until today, I did not see any of Juliana and Minsk. He had doubts and became a mouse. Who knows that there is no trace in it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the Kingdom of Holm, the number of magicians does not know how many times the church staff, so the soup can be supervised with high-level masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it discovered by them, deliberately to get rid of it?" Lucien thought of another possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup beats the table: "I don't rule out this possibility, but the chances are not great, because the past few months have been monitored like this, they have no abnormalities. The move, and yesterday was as calm as usual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The other clergyman and night watchman who was marginalized by Thrad?" Lucien will range expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum laughs, the voice is a bit serious: "If they are also missing, I will report directly to the highest review group, which shows that De sure there is a problem, the plan must be adjusted, and only two of them are confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stunned: "From the beginning of the action Twelve days, try to find them, but don't get Sald's attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no objection to Lucien's suggestions and reminders. The entire Magic Council is guessing when he will become a Great Arcane Division and enter the Supreme Council, and his current authority is on the Panel, the same as Lavin's first nine-ring Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The radicals, except for some resentment, are still stable, and the great prophet of Thrad is really good at confusing people." As a member of the Panel, the storm-mastered student, a high-level magician who has passed the test of faith, knows the cooperation, but does not know the specific action arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds the quill in his hand, I don’t know what the odds are hidden in this matter, what a secret, no matter what, Münster and Zhu Lianna is the most hated night watchman. Besides "righteousness", she is mixed with private enemies. It is very likely that any means can be used. Therefore, she asks the soup to increase the guarding of the Joel family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the newsletter, Lucien looked at the "Arcane" in front of him, but for a long time he couldn’t concentrate his attention, he was full of enthusiasm, and he was about to start. The action is really too much pressure for any knower. Even if you are good at keeping calm, in the face of unknown dangers and unknown changes, there is still a feeling of pre-storming and unbearable feelings. Of course, more importantly, I am not alone. I don’t need to think about other things. I have a lover, a teacher, a student, a friend, and a loved one. Once things fail, the result will be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or to remind the teacher and give him the explanation." Lucien knew that the soup would be reported to Fernando, but decided to go. Thunder Hell". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just leaving the office, Lucien saw Chelly knocking in the door, his face a little embarrassed and melancholy: "Teacher, are you free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" Lucien asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celly sat on the chair in front of Lucian’s desk, and her hands were stirred into a ball: “Teacher, I have a couple named Jacques, you should You know? You and the signed magic contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember, he wants to get the medicine to stimulate the blood?" Lucian nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chely smiled embarrassedly: "He was very talented and hoped to become a knight by himself, but after signing the magic contract, the will It can't be greatly enhanced. After several years of hard work, it still doesn't work, so I plan to use the contract and leave no way for myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherie's face turned red: "So, so I want to ask the teacher for your help. I have a lot of arcane points in the past few years. My father gave me a lot of Jintal and materials, and Jacques worked hard to complete the mercenary mission. The accumulated wealth should be able to be exchanged for the high blood vampire's 'source of blood', but I do not have this authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a small matter, and it is signed by itself. The magic contract, I will help you redeem it when you come back." Lu Xien said with awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cary has a long sigh of relief, her name is warm, her face is very thin, this thing has been in her heart for a long time, dare not speak, now drum It’s hard to avoid the courage to ask for a satisfactory answer. “I’m so thankful to the teacher.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhehe smiled: “Exchanged blood Source, prepare yourself to complete the ceremony? Speaking, Jacques is not bad, knowing to complete the mercenary mission to make money, rather than relying on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ceremony Not too complicated, I am sorry to trouble the teacher, I will go to the mission area to release the task, please invite the wizard of the Necromancer or the Deformation faction to come to the host." Cherie mentioned Jacques, his face showed a warm and warm smile, "He used to be A more exaggerated knight, now a lot more practical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Lucine, come and see are all outstanding men, Cherie vs. Jacques had a new understanding, but fortunately he changed a lot and his feelings continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien hasn’t spoken yet, and Che Li is self-proclaimed and blaming Jacques: “His last mercenary mission was dangerous, it’s actually an investigation. A cult thing, he did not stimulate the blood, almost died inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cult?" Lucien is very sensitive to this word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celi nodded. "It is a cult. In fact, it has a close relationship with the Church of Truth. It is an organization established privately by the bottom clerics of some of the radicals of Stewart. It seems to be the king of worshipping angels, and he deviates from the teachings that can only believe in the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After years of magical life, her faith has almost disappeared, but she is still used to it. The land is called "the Lord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien brows again: "The King of Angels..." What is Thrall thinking? Still thinking about crossing the stormy strait and unifying the church beliefs? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Che Li’s original story, Lucien thought: “As the church and the parliament control each area in the new different space. Steady, Holm’s situation will definitely become more and more dangerous. You remind your father to be prepared as soon as possible, and the split will be split to prevent a full-scale war.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my father has always been prepared in this regard, starting with the agreement between the family and the parliament." Cherie did not think more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent away Che Li, Lucien went directly to the 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, ready to go to Thunder Hell through a fixed transmission array, the result The teacher is in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are here." Fernando seems to have known that Lucien will come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded. "I know some abnormalities from the soup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He told me, but there is no other discovery for the time being." Fernando had a map of Rantat's city in front of him. "This is where the radicals are marginalized, the regions where different nobles are located, and Several parts of the Tate Divine Array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a confidential map taken from Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went to the teacher and followed the map, and found that Sard really marginalized the radicals, starting from the west and going southeast of the city. The Glorious Cathedral in the northeast of the city and the Nexus Palace, the rarer the number of radical clerics and night watchers, the more the nobility and the area where the Glorious Cathedral is located, even one, even the history of Shidong The Grail Knights' Residents were also transferred to the vicinity of the Rantart Monastery in the northwest of the city, completely waiting for the Magic Council to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels a little weird." Lucien looked at the map, but there was nothing weird about it, even if it was astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
