			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, because the sheet music of the piano pieces was taken to Joseph to register, Lucien got up and exercised, and after using the breakfast prepared by the cook, Take a stroll to the musicians association in the administrative district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is close to nine o'clock, and the wide street is filled with melodious music, which makes the reputation of Alto's music capital come out, and makes Lucien laugh. And the strange thing is that I can already hear the first movement of the G major string serenade that I played last night. The lively melody that comes to the forefront sounds from time to time: "Which musician will sell the music?" To the bards and street performers, so that they can have more than one performance track?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having to say, in the entertainment surname, popular surname and surname This piece of music really has to beat the symphony of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atmosphere of music, Lucien walked into the hall of the association, and Elena, who was in charge of reception today, immediately gave me something when she saw him. Eyes, signaling Lucien to come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elena?" Lucien stood in front of the wooden cabinet and whispered strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena smirked a few times before she said, "Lu Xien, there are already a few noble ladies who have come to you and want to follow you." Learning piano and music, huh, huh, among them are Miss Philippe's good friend Yvette. Right, here are the letters sent to you by the nearby national musicians, all want to discuss symphony creation with you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent coincidence is the period in which the "Music Review" "Symphony Guide" was fully released in the central and western countries of the mainland and received feedback from the "readers". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took over a large number of letters and looked upstairs. They were a little scared to Yvette, thinking about it, directly to Elena. Said: "Elena, there are similar things in the future, you tell them, because I am focusing on creating a piece of music, so in the past year, in addition to being the music consultant of His Royal Highness, no longer accept any invitation, no receipt Any music student. Oh, the foundation of my own music is still very weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, are you inspired by the creation of music?" Kathy, who was next to him, heard the conversation between the two, widened his eyes, and stared at Lucien very curiously. Isn’t it said that he adapted a Canon to create a piano piece? Is his inspiration so continuous? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and jokingly replied: "Oh, because I want to have a concert of my own as soon as possible." This is for the future. Things are a stepping stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really admirable and envious.” Casey and Elena also lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Elena asked Ai Ai: "Lu Xien, have you really not accepted music students recently? I have said that waiting for you to become music The family follows you to learn music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "We are friends, Elena, if you have music problems, come Ask me, but I really don’t have time to teach students in the last year.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien is protecting Nerena in a hidden way, if she is there The people who were taught by the Magic Council headquarters got news. The average friend is fine. If John becomes a knight, their family is not a big problem, but their music students are probably very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Lucien." Elena was able to get such a promise and was very satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien handed the score to Elena, let her go to Joseph to register, and she was going to practice on the fourth floor piano room, avoiding waiting. Those noble ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Elena just went upstairs, and a dark purple low-key carriage came outside the Musicians’ Association. It’s the usual Natasha sent to pick up the Sean. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness invites Mr. Evans to you. Some books do not need to be translated. You can watch them directly." The coachman politely transferred to Luna to Luna. Shake’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head, Natasha was really anxious, as long as he decided what to do, he went all out and bravely forwarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the study of the "War Gallery", Natasha, wearing a black court dress, took Lucien to walk in a row of bookshelves and gave him an introduction: "There is a knight novel, there is classical Opera, there are historical documents of various countries, there are travel notes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction to the location of the book storage, Natasha pointed to a middle-aged desk next to the window Man: "He is a famous historian, an ancient linguist, Mr. Baker, a member of the Hill family. I specially invited him to translate some of the books written in ancient magical empire for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker is bald when he is less than 50 years old, the remaining hair is white and thin, and the laterally developed face is covered with thick glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Baker, thank you for your help." Lucien politely greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bakers had stood up when Natasha came in, and also responded to Lucien with a skillful etiquette: "Can serve the Royal Highness of the Princess, can It is my pleasure to help you Mr. Evans. I am translating for you the "Heroes of the Dark Ages", which is the emergence of many heroes. Under the guidance of the God of Truth, overthrow the excellent poems left by the era of evil wizards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw a black book cover on the table, decorated in a different style from the current book, pretending to pick it up and flip it quickly. Once again: "It's really complicated and evil words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "The Dark Age Heroes Poetry Collection" appears completely in the Lucian Soul Library. The classified bookshelf is "ancient literature." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien just flipped it, didn’t look at it at all, no matter Natasha or Baker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baker smiled: "The information in many of the ruins and the ancient literature are written in this kind of text, so we have to learn them, as long as we guard against this evil. The words are circulated to the civilians. Mr. Evans, I am a devout believer, I hope that these works I can translate will help you to get inspiration and create a solemn movement that praises the true God and praises the hero."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also hope to have such inspiration." Lucien laughed perfunctorily, and could not write "Get up, hungry and ruthless slaves... fight for the truth"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating a few words, Baker continued to work in translation work, Lucien "followed" another ancient magical empire book: "His Royal Highness, why they Haven't translated yet? Don't you usually watch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nobles who have studied at the monastery understand the words of the ancient Ilvanas magic empire, I I don't need to translate.” Natasha saw that Lucien was like a quick check of the book, and he didn't care to explain his doubts. “Well, Lucien, you can't read the book, I have already told you. The knight takes it away, and you can read it freely in the rest of the study. I went to the piano room to create a piece of music. If there is a problem, I will come over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Natasha left, Lucien immediately looked at the linguistic books in the study room with hunger and thirst. In order not to be suspicious, she did not flip it quickly, but read it very carefully. After a lot of reading in more than a month, Lucien finally got rid of the ignorance and confusion of the world since the crossing, and had a new understanding of the situation on the mainland. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because ancient magicians have acquired powerful magic by analyzing and simulating the power of various magical creatures, they have been conducting bloody human experiments all the year round, trying to integrate into each After the blood is passed into the human body, after the death of countless human beings, and after every human being living has almost the same kind of blood, the research in this area has reached its peak, but the rule of the magicians has reached a precarious level. And the experimental products with strong blood power have rioted and rebelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was no way to beat those powerful magicians, but they always secreted The truth of the development of the gods on the stage, in no way inferior to the power of the magic empire, led the bloody aristocrats to smash the climax of the smashing magic empire, this year is the beginning of the sacred calendar, followed by the 'dawning for more than four hundred years War '.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the screening, Lucian sees the literature depicting the magicians as evil and horror, shaping the heroes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Violet family was originally the Earl of the Western Heilz Empire, mastered the mighty Knights, and cooperated with the church at the Western End of the Twilight War. Otto, who occupied the last important city of the magic empire, was sealed as a Grand Duke and came out of the Divine Heilz Empire (Read-Li)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
