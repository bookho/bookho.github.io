			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray is faded, the sky is still dark, and all the demons that are seen by the "Devil Prince" changing colors are in complete madness, shouting The sound is like a beast without reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red earth continues to collapse, the gushing blood is bent and turned into a flowing dark river, the root in the darkness The withered and decaying tentacles restored vitality and vitality, extending from all directions to Lucien, Malfurion and the natural altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one giant hand with dark scales and disgusting fluff, with sharp nails and prominent bones, scratching under the splattered black liquid The magical statue of Ferragad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is restored from the solid state of "Advanced Time Stop". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and Space Scepter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant hand of "Devil Prince" is about to touch In the negative sentimental statue, Lucien’s voice was utterly lingering in the curse, and a little bit of light condensed into a dreamy scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this scepter, the "Devil Prince" giant hand and the dark statue swayed a faint ripple, as if from a moment The end of the world, separated by countless time and space! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien’s promotion to the third-order legend, the power of the “time and space scepter” was truly realized. The vagaries of time and space are not only reflected in the acceleration of time and the solidification of space, but also in various clever uses, such as the effect of imitating the "guardian of God", of course, due to certain roads unknown. The reason for this is not in the same world, the effect of countless time and space, compared with the "guardian of God" and the shield of truth, there is still less detachment and untouchable feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the giant hand of the "Devil Prince" and the dark statue is only one meter away, but it can no longer advance a little, the illusory ripples are created. The overlapping time and space makes it necessary to travel through different worlds to reach the destination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha sees it, the silver-gray sword is the same, still so steadfastly slamming into the dark statue, the illusory gap that condenses seems to be cutting everything, let The black gas that is constantly emerging in the void is broken and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sly head in the dark sky reveals a violent mood, his mouth is open, and the four snake-like fangs are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Devil Prince" suddenly made a beast-like roar. This word does not seem to have any meaning, but it seems to contain the most evil and chaotic meaning, let the surrounding The darkness of the boiling makes the void show different scenes, boiling ocean, boneless wasteland, hypocritical castle, soul swamp, abyss stomach bag, dark jungle and other evil abyss planes are hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Word? Lucien still has to think in the future. With a bang, the soul and the brain seem to have been smashed by a giant hammer. Various negative emotions and desires for killing bloodthirsty are spewing out, and the "mind barrier" of the body is blessed. The magic effects are broken one by one, and the wall of the space where the "time and space scepter" solidifies is also contaminated with a layer of black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steep turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic effect on the body temporarily offsets the "Devil Prince" howl In the moment, Lucien seized the opportunity to read the mantra, and the crystal clear mirror condensed out. The pattern was simple and mysterious. It was not as foggy as the "mirror of fate". After the mirror, it seemed to connect with another. world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the mirror of the rebound caused by the “sudden turn” has a deep crack, because the “Dark Word” is not a single spell, so Can bounce back, just weaken the damage, so that Lu Xien did not faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Word" is not an abyss and hell language, it is some kind of legendary magic, a manifestation of the nature of the abyss and hell, only the abyss will closest to both The Lord of Hell, the Demon Prince, and the first lord of Hell, the Lord of the Hell, Mardi Moss, is a variant of the Dark Proverb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the numerous time and space between the giant hand and the statue of Ferragad is solidified one layer at a time, no longer illusory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario is preparing to cast a druid transformation, turning into a horrible rock giant to destroy the natural altar, but just met the "Dark Saint The shock of the words, so the natural magic is destroyed, dizzy, and can only recover the wooden rod defense that trapped the "blood king." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green leaves and leaves that grow in the flesh and blood disappear, and the heads of the evil dogs and the heads of the human face are screaming and killing, and the devil princes are matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil prince’s giant hand erects, the black corrosive liquid exudes a strong evil chaos, catching the front solidified like a translucent amber Above the illusory time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, a crack in the road is produced above these illusory time and space, spreading rapidly, breaking and breaking, giant hands passing through them, near Veragan De statue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abyss, the demon prince's strength will be supernormal, if it is in its "demon stomach bag" plane, it is closer to the power of the gods. It is like the Pope of the Northern Church who performed the "God Drop". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Lucien was not nervous and afraid, because the purpose of the demon prince seemed to be clear, that is, to get the dark statue and start the natural altar. I didn’t block time and space at all, and I didn’t concentrate my attention on myself and Natasha and Malfurion. I waited for someone to go and I was able to leave immediately, and even if the demon prince was fully committed to himself, in the “blood plain”. On the other hand, I have enough confidence to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, a long tail suddenly popped out, stabbing toward Lucien, the tip was filled with black air, with a strong negative atmosphere, as if When it is hit by it, it will immediately become like a decaying ray and a sword of darkness, and its strength will drop rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the main offensive methods of the "Devil Prince"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the crisp sounds, the tail covered in black scales stabbed on the steep mirror in front of Lucien, let it break Cracked, and it itself rolled back and stabbed to the head of the skull that stood out in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wrath of Nature!" Malfurion faced the bloody king who had rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the demon prince’s giant hand has touched the negative emotion statue of Ferragad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First create a vacuum with storm enchantment, then use a male electronic gun to annihilate the dark statue together with the demon prince's descending body..." Lucian calmly thought It is intended to give it a sigh of demon prince before moving the target to himself and Natasha, even if it is not completely dead, can not completely kill it, but also its purpose is difficult to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the "natural heart" on the "natural altar" became brighter and more green, and the surrounding space was completely blurred, showing a natural A harmonious world, from the birth, growth, prosperity, decline, death and re-growth of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the world blends into the atmosphere, letting it turn into a light green stream, and shoot it out from the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar has collapsed and seems to have lost all vitality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Spirit of Nature" streamed short arrows and came first, and immediately shot on the dark statue, hitting the "Devil Prince" hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark statue is torn apart, and an illusory elf face is blended into the light green stream with a strong negative emotion, and it is shot into the giant hand with it. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon prince made a scream, and the black rainstorm poured down. Corrodes everything and destroys everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palm of his hand grows a light green and green branch, above his arm, on his head, in various eyes with varying colors There is also a root bud that grows vigorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it can no longer maintain the attitude of falling in the air, the huge body is completely highlighted from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
