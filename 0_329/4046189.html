			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many magical theories of the ancient magical empire have long been overthrown by the rapid development of arcane research, and many meditation ideas have been unable to keep up with the times. Magic is still widely welcomed by the current magicians. Every time you explore the remains, in addition to magic items and materials, the most wanted is the unique magic, magic array and magic ritual, because the only criterion for measuring magic is that it works well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the ancient magic of the magical creature structure and improved, no matter how magical and unpredictable, or powerful, most of them are inferior to the current similar magic The difference may be that the past is the seven or eight ring magic, and now through the arcane research to find its essence and law, improved the structure, reduced the learning requirements, became the four-five ring magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the unique magic can also inspire the Arcans. Many of the magical parliament results of the magic parliament were discovered by studying the unique magic, so for the submission of the unique magic, the parliament never rewards the arcane points and the arcane points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique magic above "Stars and Elements" has only started from the Third Ring. Lucien has not learned and analyzed yet, it is difficult in a short time. Picking out a few submissions that are less important, the ones that are currently able to make an idea are the magic that they create or improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the magical charms of the human (Mage Edition) and Charismatic Human (The Knight Edition) is one of Lucien’s current cards, and he proposes brainwaves in the Magic Council. Before the concept of human hormones, Lucien was not planning to hand over. Maybe in the future, he would use the two magics to create explorations in this field, and gradually become the authority of similar research in the illusion system and the dead spirit system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the professor’s resonating hand is handed over, and then combines Aalto’s affairs, he basically assumes his “professor’s identity”. Lucien intends to wait until there is The five-ring magic level then submits a paper to discuss the problem of resonance, and if the artificial cooperation of "urea" is not preemptive, it is estimated that it will wait until then to avoid the double strike of the Necromancer magician and the church without corresponding Self-protection ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no more than the Earth, the scientists have no fighting power, and the Magic Council solves the academic dispute through violent means. Lucien knows from the mouth of Astar. More than a dozen cases. In some cases, not the arcane teachers are narrow-minded, but can reach their similar level. It is impossible to change the concept until the powerful facts prove, and they are not gods, they have their own emotions, so the debate is fierce. Among them, one who did not hold back may have become a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Astal, the Magic Council has now placed a number of discussion occasions on a small anti-magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless forced, how much strength does it do, which is the conclusion that Lucien experienced after so many dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to submit 'bat screaming'." Lucien's right index finger gently tapped the table in front of him, weighing the pros and cons, like falling into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar did not continue this topic, just smiled and looked at Lucien with a deep glance, can change the concept into the magic parliament is everyone's own thing, Others can't interfere...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp whistle screams again, the speed of the magic steam train slows down slowly, and finally docks on a gloomy platform There are more than a dozen people wearing classical black magic robes or empty hands or carrying a suitcase to the door between the two cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the damn corpse, the most unbearable thing about this route is to go through the 'Heidler' city.” Lazar Low The voice complained, both annoying and a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Heidler’ city?” Lucien looked out of the window with a puzzled look, and was surprised to find a crack in the outside of the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because of the constant ability of the "曰之冕" to see the entrance to the dead world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a crack, when traveling on the mainland, Lucien only found five or six, and I realized that I just found one after just resisting the Holm Kingdom. For the Necromancers to appear here, I immediately understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar continues to suppress the voice: "It didn't take long for the Arcane Parliament to be established. This damn love corpse found the 'Heidler' city filled with a strong death. Power, so the headquarters of the 'Pale Hand' has been moved here. If you travel to 'Heidler', you will find more undead than living people, and even a small number of new varieties with IQ can help farmers grow oatmeal, help Blacksmith forging steel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the other side approached, the Necromancer led the sick man in a black trench coat to make both of them horrified at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferry wears a black top hat, accustomed to inserting his hands in a black trench coat pocket, and looking at the entrance of the two compartments with a gaze Come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar quickly got up and saluted: "Mr. Felipe, good afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic The parliament abandoned many bad habits of the ancient magical empire, such as the apprentice's personal attachment, but the respect for the scholars and the strong is the same. Therefore, although Lazar is a magician of the will of the element, he can face his filippo regardless of his arcane or magical level, and he has to show his respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe just looked at it casually, even Lazar was the organization's magician who didn't care, nodded slightly, turned to the front of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Lazar, who is this gentleman? It looks like a strong man." Sitting in the soft sea behind Lucian Titus squatted on the chair, admiringly looking at the door of another compartment where Felipe's back disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien sees that Felipe has not produced any sensational feelings for himself, quietly vomiting and watching with the same curiosity as other apprentices. Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar’s bright smile has disappeared, slightly bitter and authentic: “This is a magician of the Necromancer’s 'Pale Hand’, Felipe Sir, it is a genius similar to the one that I mentioned to Evans before, such as Ulysses, Larry, and Timothy. It is a four-level arcane master and a five-ring necromancer." Felipe is next door. In the carriage, he subconsciously used honorific words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe? I heard of him, forcing the person who broke through the church blockade?" Sprint seems to see the object of his worship. Excitedly, "and it’s not a high-level magician who went to the church’s purification sequence. It’s so cool!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices in the car are excited The look of the car looked at the end of the carriage, although they could not see anything, but this is a living person with a "legendary experience." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We also have a similar gentleman in the will of the element, he is called 'Professor', and the ranking of the purification sequence is only one less than that of Mr. Felipe." Efforts to maintain the image of the will of the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard Lazar’s answer and pondered: “Knowing that 'Professor’ is very simple on the list of purification sequences, but how to determine I am the person of the elemental will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien asks: "I listened to Mr. Astar's "Professor" on the purification sequence. "But is he the elemental will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Mr. Felipe seems to have had contact and conflict with Mr. Professor, this time after returning several times The magician who secretly investigated the will of our elements, the result was discovered by the Governor of Gaston and clicked and killed. The matter was very loud and it was the latest news of the parliament.” Lazar turned back and peeked at the other carriage, whispering: “A lot of the arcane masters who know Mr. Felipe think that after he returned this time, he has become calm, not as arrogant and proud as before, and what mystery seems to be doing experiments.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Felipe is accusing me of being the will of the element, but There is a synthetic synthesis that leaks urea, otherwise the recent news will not be able to kill him almost by the high-level magician. All the gentlemen who study the magical and elemental magic will boil." Lucien quietly thought. "Is Felipe trying to synthesize other living things? But his strength is terrible than I thought, and he can escape from a high-ranking magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina seems to be interested in the mysterious "professor" and asks what Lucien wants to ask: "Mr. Lazar, is the professor who is the element of the will?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Professor's existence is affirmed by Lord Hathaway's Arcane Master, but she did not mention which one." Lazar himself is not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was suddenly embarrassed, this is the rhythm that was exposed? After discussing the members of the elemental will, they will find that their organization has not taught this person. Although it is not excluded that good things don't leave a name, most people do not need to hide this kind of thing. After all, there is strength and backstage. It is normal to stand up and get the glory that belongs to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
