			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown who thought that Lucien Evans had a close relationship with the professor from the beginning, before rushing to No. 116 in Jisu District, considered the two to unite The possibility of framing yourself, such as letting Lucien Evans pretend to be seriously injured by himself, then Natasha, Camille or the Principal Intelligence of the Principality witnessed and prevented it and killed or captured himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown carefully scrutinized and found that if you frame yourself, the vulnerability would be larger. If you kill yourself on the spot, the person who sympathizes with himself in the referee will certainly not accept the conclusion casually. At least a strict inquiry and verification of Lucien is required. This is definitely not a question for Lucien, who has many doubts and close relationship with the professor. Good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha can’t be strong against the church’s reasonable demands, and other nobles will not support it – in the relationship between the church and the nobility, both sides have With a certain bottom line, no one will pass it arbitrarily, and the church will occupy a strong position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just design traps to catch themselves, as long as they are not dead on the spot, the chances of turning over themselves are great. How was Lucien injured? What about the signs of the injury? Does it match the characteristics of your own blood? I am a chasing professor who came here. This matter can be confirmed by the "Sage" Viscount Klein. Why did Lucien go to the No. 116 Jishou District in the middle of the night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that this conscience can directly ask the church to interrogate and lie with the magical means, and they can prove their innocence through them. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien Evans is so surprised to the extreme death, which is beyond the imagination of the clown. In his mind, the picture of the winged angel-like fall was solidified, and the scene of the fireworks-like "bloom" looked like a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he believes that Lucien Evans is really dead, because if he uses a short-distorted body to disguise himself, then unless he It does not appear, no longer appears as the great musician Lucien Evans, otherwise it is useless. If you kill yourself, it will make the church suspect that there is a problem, and you must make a strict inquiry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short period of loss, the eyes of the clown's funny mask slammed into two points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw Natasha who was there in midair, wearing a gorgeous purple court dress with a slender fit and long legs. The eyes are full of brilliance, the lips are red and tender, but the heroic but beautiful and beautiful, like the aristocratic lady who meets the lover in the middle of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Natasha’s gaze has completely solidified at this time, and it seems to have lost the soul and looked at the flesh and blood "fireworks". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape! escape! escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the thoughts that have flashed in the mind of the clown. Never wait for a second in front of a woman who has witnessed the most intimate lover being separated. This woman also has extremely powerful destructive power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, she will not reason at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the danger, the clown broke out all the potential, and there seemed to be an invisible black thin line rising around the air. And he stepped on and grabbed these thin lines, and fled to the edge of the woods behind the villa between two or three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, he heard a roar of anger and sorrow, or closer to the whine, and the nearby earth and the air seemed to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" The clown flew into the woods, but a silver-gray sword light shattered everything and slammed into his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianguang quickly turned into an invisible, distorted and strange gap, not a short distance disappearing, the layer of magical light and magical items shining on the clown The light is cut like ordinary paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown body suddenly twisted, and the whole person became a toy figure that was wrapped in black lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin lines are broken, and the black doll appears on the gap that almost divides it into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the clown returned to its original state, but the right half of the body was separated from the torso and landed on the ground, and the internal organs, blood, and the like splashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Natasha’s first sword failed to kill himself, there is still hope for himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong will allows the clown to endure severe pain and the injury that can make most of the bishops soft, and the speed does not slow down, in the dark woods Concealed and escaped, while he calmly squirmed the body, let the blood be wrapped in an invisible film, no longer spilling, leaving no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows that if Natasha has another sword, she will never be able to hide, and Natasha suddenly forgets that she can no longer attack. Zero, but hope to be small, but also to fight, can not give up because of their despair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you hate Lucien Evans, the spirit of never giving up in his music is what every knight should have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miracle seemed to happen until the clown disappeared into the darkness, and Natasha’s second sword did not come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Waldo, you want to stop me?" Natasha held a silver-white, long sword, her eyes cold and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waolirit referee "Visitor" Valdo is frantically flying under the invisible momentum, but he is still standing still in Na In front of Tasha, calmly said: "His Royal Highness, I have sent a night watchman to catch the clown. And before things are clear, I think it is best to keep his life. Just now, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the clown was a cautious inspection of a house, when Natasha slammed into him, the "surveyor" Valdo arrived at the scene. He is more sympathetic to the clown, and he naturally prevented Natasha's second attack, so as not to be "killed" by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Camille, who seemed to be afraid of disturbing before, flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The clown killed Lucian." Natasha replied as if she was suppressing infinite anger, and the silver-purple eyes became indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" All of the night watchers, including Valdo, exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just arrived at the back of the villa, and Juliana, who was preparing to "hunt" the clown, almost fell and her face became extremely white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great musician Lucien Evans is dead? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, like the clowns, did not anticipate this possibility! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to have given up the chasing clown and returned the matter to the night watchman, closing his eyes and saying: "I saw Lucien in front of me. Death, and the clown is right next to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is desolate, with a deep sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is no complete flesh and blood on the lawn in front of the villa, Valdo quietly took a breath and took the relationship with the intimate lover of the Violet and her intimate lover. Since I said that I saw Lucien Evans dead, it would not be possible to have a living big musician in a few days. Looking at this technique and distinguishing motives, it is really a clown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I can understand your mood, please don't be too sad, I think Mr. Evans does not want you to forget happiness." Valdo is The cross is painted with a cross. "He is so outstanding, so good that the Lord called him early and let him continue the creation of music in Paradise Hill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After comforting a few words, Valdo’s expression was solemn: “However, my Royal Highness, now I need to ask you some questions and check if the blood belongs to Mr. Evans. This is not to doubt you, but the normal referee’s process, I hope you Can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Natasha nodded, Valdo was careful and alert, afraid that she suddenly lost her mind. Although she is the sixth-order, she is the top bloodline, and she is in extreme grief and indignation. She may not be able to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes of silence, Natasha opened her eyes, and the silver-purple scorpion was cold and deep: "Mr. Waldo, you ask."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a princess who is more men than many men. Valdo really appreciates Natasha at this time, and told the night watchman who didn’t chase the clown to check the blood and discretion. Asked: "His Royal Highness, why are you coming here in the middle of the night? Is Mr. Evans still in retreat? Even if you have a cough in the middle of the night, you can choose Mr. Evans’s current villa retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the back, I seem to be afraid of crying, Natasha stunned her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waldo, who has emerged from countless fragrant scenes, secretly swears by himself, how can you think about it without sympathy and kindness at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I understand." Valdo nodded gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he asked a few questions, a bishop-level vigil flew up and whispered in his ear: "The moonlight is indeed the way The blood of Sean Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Waldo, the clown was smashed by me, I should live for an hour, I hope you can find it earlier. He." Natasha said that she did not have the real reason to catch up with the clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she looked around and saw an iron ring-like thing on the lawn, so she flew down and picked it up, her expression was sweet and sweet. Sad and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is exactly the same as the first movement of "Moonlight". I can't think of the feminine side of the Princess's Highness. It is worthy of the Violet's Violet. "Waldo and many night watchers who like music come to the fore." A pretty woman who is usually hard-boiled and heroic, suddenly shows this expression. Under strong contrast, it makes people feel sad but dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is the iron ring, Valdo is very clear, it is the ruined Holm crown ring, is the relic of Natasha mother, now look It seems to be a token of love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please don't be too sad. This is our fault, we did not catch the clown in time." Valdo once again comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha shook her head: "It has nothing to do with you. You have decided to kill the clown before. It is his own ran away. Well, it has nothing to do with the church." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Natasha understand the words, Valdo was satisfied and relaxed and nodded. What he feared most was this thing for the church and Natasha. There is an irreparable gap between the future rulers of Wauriot: "You are a devout believer and a wise lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valdo and others began to inspect the villa and the surrounding area. Natasha took a light breath. The previous "love" said that she felt weird, a bit rich and vomiting, and a bit unspeakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the main reason for her sigh of relief is that Valdo has no doubt that things are moving in the direction of their hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a devout believer, occasionally hitting the church to protect his good friends and maintain the status of the nobility, Natasha has no psychological barriers, but It is self-willing to do what I want to do with the things that I have planned and the things that Lucian has planned to destroy the prestige of the church, destroy the relationship between it and the nobility, and destroy its image in people's minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Lucien can understand that everyone has their own persistence and bottom line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............In a villa, a middle-aged man in a black hooded robes lost his eyes and sat on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that the morning star that has been silent is turned into a traitor." The sage's face was pale and weak, and seemed to have lost a lot of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I observed the reaction of each apprentice to hear the news of the Magic Council headquarters, he actually saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professor in front of him is still covered in a black robe, then reaches out and writes a few words on the morning star with blood:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outcome of the traitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the sages can't understand the professor's actions: "Mr. Professor, why should you leave the body and the aphorisms, codenames? Let the morning star disappear, push everything to the clown, push it to the church, isn't it better?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now this will allow hatred and attention to be concentrated on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
