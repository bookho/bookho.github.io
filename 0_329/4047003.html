			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Brunsell’s manor has become more and more dilapidated after the change of ownership. The hills behind the manor are covered with weeds and shine in the morning sun. Next, rolling the dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, dew drops on a pile of white bones, leaving a faint wet mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of this giant serpent gently shook a bit, but soon regained peace, and around it, a giant tiger fur with a double wing fell The flesh and blood rot, the yellow pus is flowing; a ghoul is flaunting his own stench; the countless ghosts are floating in the air, and there is no fear of the falling sun... The hills seem to have become The legendary underworld is full of undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among these undead creatures, a skinny man sits on a boulder, and his pale, faint left hand gently strokes the stone. The dark, deep eyes looked quietly at the direction of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the gate of the city, a middle-aged man dressed in a bishop’s robe was looking serious toward the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Bishop." People who passed him all said hello, he is the bishop of the city's cathedral, Arroyo, second only to the red. The great figure of the bishop, a very strict clergyman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arroyo painted a cross on his chest and habitually blessed: "The Lord will bless everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he slowly came to the door of the church, stepped on the ladder under the tribute of several Paladins, and stepped into the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the gate, the faint light of the light lingers, making everything appear solemn and solemn, making the soul clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arroyo stopped in the middle of the hall and prayed devoutly: "On the truth forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then he left from the side door. Report to the cardinal about the beliefs of nearby towns, manors, and villages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing the report, he began a patrol of the entire church to check for omissions and disrespect, and after the tour, it will be prayer and repentance. And the time of study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his monotonous life day after day for more than 30 years, but with this life he is following behind the bishop The pastor of the trainee slowly became the most prominent bishop of the church in the city, witnessing the prosperity and decline of many families in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for the gift of the Lord." He really prayed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praying is over. He found himself patrolling the room with a transmission array. So I increased my vigilance and began to confirm that it was intact. No one else was allowed except the ones allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Nothing unusual." His serious face showed a smile. The eyes are watching the transmission array of weak light flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly. He frowned and felt that the transmission was unusually odious and full of evil. Like the door to hell or the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has automatically come up with an idea in his mind: a cleric betrayed, "Hell Lord" invaded here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you must ruin it!" He just made up his mind, suddenly had a clear understanding, relying on his own magical power, simply can not be in a short time The only way to destroy this transmission array is to concentrate all the power and directly blew it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly rises to the sacred sense of the martyrdom, stepping forward, high-pitched:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only the truth will last forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the trainee pastors who followed him stunned and watched the body of Arroyo’s body glow, and then banged The loud noise, the world is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission array was blown apart and the room collapsed directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in his mind, two nine-ring magic emerged: invading the mind, weaving memories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although even the legendary magician may not be able to play these two spells so much, without any flaws, the subject has no resistance, voluntarily and automatically Achieve the purpose for the caster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a magician is the most difficult to guard against, the most terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another part of the city, the core of the control defensive array was overwhelmed by the blew light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the two consecutive explosions, the thin man in the middle of the hill outside the city stood up, half of his gaze was tender and half cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures on the hills are screaming out of death, climbing from the ground, and the mountains are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin man floated into the air and flew toward the city, behind his feet were all undead from the "Avenge of the Abyss"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers at the gate of the city were originally checking the team entering the city. Suddenly, the sky was darkened, and the subconscious looked up and suddenly frightened and fought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-air, a monster with only white bones or carrion covers the sun, bringing the call of death, and among them, It is an evil necromancer who has not pulled up the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were soft on their legs and sat directly on the ground. The crowds lined up and fled, and they were quickly scared by the undead army. Fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead creatures are not jealous, there is no rush, and they are ignorant of these people, directly rushing to the gate of the city, or entering the door or over the wall or flying into the field. city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cleric and knight from different parts of the city Come out and meet the Necromancer in midair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Necromancer seems a bit embarrassed and said to himself: "I am Vicente, I am back..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill him!" A holy light, a long gun, all attacked Vicente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicent's skinny face reveals a bitter hatred, raises his head, and makes a screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A circle of sound waves spread out, a fuzzy banshee flying, all flying clergy and knights raining like landing, but not flying, watching In the middle of the sky, I was so scared that I was shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente's expression became cold, watching the cardinal who was trying to resist the "Buddhist's Donkey", raised his left hand and gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal suddenly made a lot of black air, and the whole person became dry and thin, like a corpse. Then, he was unable to fall from the air and fell into several pieces, but there was no blood spilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente overlooked the city and landed in front of a middle-aged knight holding a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, don't kill me..." The middle-aged knight groaned with trepidation and kept going back, the knights around him had been scared Run boldly. No one dares to help him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente is hoarse and shy: "Andrew."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You. You know me, You, you are Vicente!” Middle-aged Knight Andrew’s eyes wide open in horror, recognizing the identity of the horrible necromancer. His face is not flesh and blood. Skinny abnormality. There is no difference from more than twenty years ago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente walked slowly toward Andrew: "It's you, you reported me, killing Shirley."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mad dog? Where is he?" Vicente asked coldly, and directly invaded the mind without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrew is willing to be honest in order to save his life: "The 'mad dog' has been praised by the cardinal of the Principality for killing many magicians without telling the evidence. Transferred to Cux."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cooks? I will definitely look for you..." Vicente looked into the distance, his eyes were very cold, There is hatred that cannot be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he continues to look at Andrew: "Who else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, still There are Lothar, and also, Gao En, 'Tamemaster', the interrogator 'The digger', they are here at the referee." Andrew recruited all the people involved in the year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, in order to thank you for your frankness, I will not kill you by myself." Vicente reveals a cruel smile, behind the undead army I swarmed and drowned Andrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful screams are ringing, constantly ringing, undead creatures The bite devours Andrew's flesh and blood, one by one, until the bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente’s eyes looked at the nobility gathered here, watching them push out Lothar and Gao En, then waved their hands Let the two nobles rot and become zombies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicente, the original thing has nothing to do with us, we are very sorry about the death of Shirley and Brunzer, you have to take revenge, we don't Will stop, but please don't involve innocent." The leading aristocratic knight tried to calm his emotions and sincerely asked for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente’s eyes are cold and succinct: “You have a chance to save her, you have done nothing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice just fell, the undead army swarmed and drowned the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Vicente walked over to the referee’s door with his tired bones, and most of the night watchmen, including the “tamer”, Already killed in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord will not let you go!" The interrogators of the referee looked at Vicente in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente did not say anything, let the undead army directly engulf them, leaving only a scream and a white hair Bone man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only regret that I couldn't torture your whereabouts!" "The bone-cutting man" is a fanatical and sincere look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will have a lot of time to regret it." Vicente whispered, whispering, without a little bit of argument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pale flame has emerged from the soul of the "digger" and burned him screaming again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main meeting, ah! will punish you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Damn, spare, spare me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise me!"< < br br br br br br br People, the whole city is dead and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this silence, Vicente walked to the cemetery and walked to the grave where the dream was dreaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave is silently split and the coffin rises directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente walked over to the coffin, kneeling down on one knee, and the gentleman gently pushed the coffin cover away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shirley, I am coming, I am coming to pick you up." As the gap grew, his cold eyes became softer and fuller. Love, love, and blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
