			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dwarf, like most adult dwarves, has a thick beard and looks bold and bold, but at this time it is not a bit reckless, but rather like a scholar The anthropologists who heard the singularly laughed and said: "I wanted to see you very long ago, but I have never been able to determine your whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Indirectly admitted that he is Viking, at least the current body that dominates this dwarf is Viking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that he said this in a casual tone, Lucien’s heart suddenly felt like a cloud, and could not help but chill. When did Viking actually have the idea of ​​killing himself? Is the general theory of relativity raised after becoming a legend? Still after the "world of the door" colluded with the monster Viken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the improvement of their own strength in these years is also fast, from the first entry to the legendary third-order is almost a glimpse, and the place to go is either the legendary allies Wang Ting, either an abyss with a viking enemy, or a short stay, no more than half a day, and with the special cover of the "destiny secret", this is not the most recognized god "meet". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Understanding the specific limitations of God's Fall, the Magic Council has a new judgment on the true strength of Viken, if there is no hidden danger in the way of thinking The monster Viken, that may be close to the true god level, even stronger than the original Tanos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, after the strength reached the legendary third-order, Lucien was not so worried about Viken, at least he still had a certain degree of confidence to escape, the only problem It is because Viking regards himself as a stab in the eyes, even if he is threatened by the monster Viken anti-customer, he must use the "God Drop" to kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts of Lucien’s heart flashed past and quickly restored to calmness. Here is Rentent, if anything happens, Hathaway and other legendary peaks are immediately I can get there, and Viken is just a projection. Can you beat yourself and say two things: "I don't know what the purpose of the disaster king appeared in front of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Disaster King········································································································ As for what I am doing, you still don't understand the god of steam, Yuri?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are really the old man who misses and feels for the past, Then I am a good person who is pure and kind and does not know any intrigues. Lu Xien secretly swears a sigh of relief, can ruthlessly erase some of his friends and live them into memories, and become a blazing angel, and there is also a "disaster king". The legendary title is the reputation of the nickname, what character is Viking? What thinking person's self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the god of steam, what is Yuri? I don't quite understand what I mean, I don't understand what you are talking about." Lucien looked like an innocent look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken smiled twice: "You can't get through other people, but you can't help me. I feel the heart of the dwarf's beliefs. I feel that I get him." The power of faith finally has the core of convergence. You don't think that I will just pick a body and come down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s gaze After Wicken became a god, he still maintained the ancient devil-like projection ability, not the ordinary projection method like magic or other gods. This way, even if it is not the god of undead mystery, it is difficult. It is difficult to be completely eliminated. It is worthy of being the one who resists and suppresses the strongest of Silvermoon, Hell, Abyss and Viking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, a large part of the reason is that the Lord of Hell and the abyss will be inconvenient, and the strength of the main material world will be suppressed, so it is difficult to act together - - There is no question of cooperation in the case of a deep will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solidification of Lucien’s gaze is not the kind of god that controls the power of emotions. He smiles calmly: “I feel that you are smart, After seeing this dwarf that you personally gave to the gods,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldn’t let me say more, the truth is more powerful than words.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he can't directly project to a high-ranking or higher-powered person who doesn't have too many negative emotional accumulations, the changes in mood are also carefully observed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a secret research project. The mystery of the gods, the essence of the power of faith, has always been the focus of the study of the legendary magicians of the parliament, such as Oliver is studying 'Dark Dragon God,.' Lucine wants to hear what Wicken is going to do, so he doesn't confess innocently, no confession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wicken does not seem to believe in the truth of Lucien. "Yes, the founder of the new alchemy and general relativity, the most authoritative arcane master in the microscopic and macroscopic fields, the main creator of the current arcane and magic system, the most The magician who is close to the world and the essence of magic actually abandoned his own research attitude, no longer focused on the real exploration of the world, no longer trusting the future of arcane and magic, and placing the focus on spreading beliefs. If you pass it out, the confidence of every arcian in the Magic Council is definitely a major blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a study, but it proves My research on the attitude of arcane has no meaning for me to spread my faith. There is no meaning in gathering the power of faith. My focus is different from yours. What I care about is the nature of the power of faith and its current arcane system. Where should I be?" Lucien is still telling the truth, whether it is the convergence of special electromagnetic waves or the gradual progress of weak observers to strong observers, it is only a hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken snorted: "Okay, don't talk about the noble excuse, I don't need to use your words to attack the Magic Council, I just want to ask you." Do you want to completely steal and use the power of faith? The monster can't directly tell you the mystery of the gods against the rules I set. It only allows you to observe and figure out, so I believe that you only know how to use it. The power of emotions has been transformed into a state of ancient devils, and it is not the best way I have improved a lot in the past decade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be very clear, Your path to the gods is missing the most important part. One leg is always out of reach. I can help you solve this. It only takes a small price for you, and will not let anyone doubt the price. After all, although there are not many high-level magicians who know the complete structure of the artificial planet, there are at least nearly 20 people. Who knows who is leaking? You are not temporary to redeem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absurd! I want to steal and use faith What methods are used? Help me uncover the nature of the force of faith do? Help me understand what it really corresponds to the principle of it? My current research can! "Lucien righteous rhetoric refused Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of righteous rhetoric. It seems to have a great shake in Wicken’s hearing. Lucien actually did not directly laugh at himself and tempted a big arcane. The teacher, but quite guilty and sorrowful, blamed for the use of this, what is the innermost thought of it. It is not difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken is not ignorant: "Useless? Why are you stealing the power of the craftsman's god Hite? Why are you stealing and using it? Concealed, but only this is excellent, and other aspects are too bad. If Hite does not change to the god of steam, you can't succeed at all. Tanos and us add up to nearly three thousand years of research, you are Can you find out in just one or two years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You······" Lu Xien slightly stunned. The person staring at himself and Wicken really had some degree of connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken judged his horror from Lucien’s expression and mood swings, thinking that he did not expect this successful and abnormally hidden thing. Actually, I will be known by myself, and I smiled and said: "Don't worry. With my method, you can directly steal the power of Hite's faith in the altar of the steam god Yuri. How about this transaction? Is it cost-effective?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not care about the substantial contribution and reward of this matter, and the sign of division within the Magic Council is the greatest success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have said it many times, I have no interest in stealing and using the power of faith, waiting for me to understand its essence and true arcane meaning, I am afraid that I can't create a method without any hidden dangers? Why do you make people like you, monsters are not like monsters." Lucien showed a smile and unknowingly despised Wicken's method, and made his own "Faith" and "high vision" are fully exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken was silent, and didn’t seem to think that Lucien really refused. Did his research really break through? Is the observer effect really the essence of the power of faith? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This road has already produced two kinds of gods, except for the natural gods, only two of them, so whether you can study it or not The essence of the power of faith will eventually return to this path, but there are fewer hidden dangers. In this sense, these materials are of great use to you. If you miss today, you will have a hard time getting it again. "Vicken sighed softly. It seems to be sorry for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
