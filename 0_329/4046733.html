			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elves have a glorious history of glory, once ruled the entire continent and many different spaces until the endless abyss and the main material world have several interconnected gaps. The demon kings led their own catastrophe, bringing killing and destruction. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this war, Elf Wang Ting finally repelled the demon army and sealed the passage, but the elves also suffered heavy casualties, and the number decreased drastically. Their fertility has been difficult, so they have never recovered. They have gradually been replaced by other races. They have retired from the "natural residences" where several ancient elves are located. One of them is a one-third of the size of the Holm Kingdom. General forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long time, the forests with the other "elves" were destroyed, occupied, and slowly integrated into human society, only Wang Ting Streep Forest relies on the deep foundation and the existence of the "Elves King Tree", and still maintains a relatively transcendental position. It is a holy place in the minds of different types of elves such as the elves, the moon elves, the wood elves, and the sea elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information of the Magic Council, there are currently more than a hundred thousand elves in the Stroop Forest, and the forces have spread to the endless ocean, with the Sea Elf tribe It rules a large part of the sea area, and it lacks expansion and self-protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Elf King Court has a total of six legends. The most powerful is the empress Agraia, which is semi-integrated with the Elf King Tree. The strength reaches the legendary peak and is good at All kinds of natural spells and broken arrows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Lucien took the initiative to apply, Douglas probably introduced him to the legend of Elf Wang Ting. "In the other five legends, there are three professions that are druids. Among them are the big Druid Malfurion who has been to the parliament before, the legendary third-order, the three of them and the other two non-elf legends. Ruy co-founded the 'Druid Presbyterian Church' to coordinate the relationship between the non-elf druid and the elf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, There are eight legends in the Stroop Forest?” Lucien had only a clear understanding of the elves and the druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s hands against his chin add to Douglas: “Yes, the two remaining elves are epic knights who can rely on the magic lines of their bodies to cast natural spells. In the forest, the combat power will increase by half a step. In specific circumstances, I will give you the information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the last time I fought the Southern Church, We are going to invite the Elf Wang Ting and the Druid Presbyterian Church as reinforcements, although they will fight against the seas of the endless Wang Yangli, such as the squid and the sea, and guard the gap between the abyss in the Stroop Forest, but draw two or three legends. Still can do, who knows that the all-out war is so fast..." Oliver said with a little regret that he is full of interest in the legend of the elves who are good at art and history - if it is a female surname, then it is even more Ok, "unfortunately I have to go to the Necromancers to explore..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the monster Viken and Pope Viken are deadly enemies, several legendary magicians in the parliament Are planning to go to the spiritual world to study the soul wall , Close look on "immortal corridor" insight into the mysteries of quantum superposition state - for them, they do not run into the North Church Pope et al., The danger is not large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that the legendary undead in the dead world was seriously damaged in the previous adventures of the parliament, even the ancient mummies of one of the four legendary third-order They were all killed by Lucien, and the spiritual legendary necromancer was nearly half fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "door world", the monster Viken will not make full effort, but it is easy to encounter the "king of angels" and six blazing angels, except for the legend At the peak of Douglas, Brooke, Fernando, Hathaway dare to go deep, and other legendary powers dare not take this danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas indulged: "This is a preliminary investigation, mainly to find out why the abyss gap that has stabilized for tens of thousands of years suddenly lost control, causing the influx of demons. And the smell of destruction and chaos spread strangely into the forest, polluting the Elf King tree, making a few elves appear to be demonized... Erica, Atlante, you are experts in the devil, who and Lucien Going together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going, I just need some demons as research materials." "The Cursed Eye" Atlante nodded with his eyes closed, his voice The hoarseness is low but it seems to be in everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the decision was made, the emergency meeting soon came to an end, and most of the top panelists, such as Fernando and Brooke, left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the field of mathematics shows signs of flourishing after the publication of the journal Nature, it is not comparable to the big leap in the micro-domain, so they have to temporarily stop and transfer to the mathematical research to make up the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the state of the microscopic field in recent times, limited by the mathematical foundation, the raging wave has slowed down, waiting for the next embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took Lucien and Atlante into a room on the 35th floor, and the two blond elves stood up and screamed. With anxiously: "Dr. Douglas, have you decided on a good candidate? Are these two lords? Hey, Lucy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are acquaintances of Lucien - Prince Exxon and Princess Ellestin, so they couldn't help but blurt out after seeing Lucien, but they quickly remembered Lucien's identity, and his look was positive: "...Evans "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the greeting, the emotions of Exeter and Elstin are quite complicated. When I first met Lucien ten years ago, He is still only a second-ring magician. At that time, the level of his own two reached the middle level in the human mouth. But only ten years later, he is already a legendary second-order magician, and the two of them are still in the middle. Just approached the high level! And the speed of their own strength is calculated in the Elf family! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elves, ten years is too long, but when they face Lucien again, they suddenly have a feeling of time vicissitudes. Let the forest turn into the sea, and the sea dried up into a field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder Lucien Evans emphasizes that time is a change..." Ellerd has a basic understanding of arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of their two elves is almost the same as ten years ago, the temperament is a little mature, and the dress is still refreshing and close to nature, so Lucy En also recognized them, and nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'Atomic Control' Lucifer Evans, 'The Eye of Curse' Atlante Forman, the two of them will lead some of the high-end magic The teacher went to the forest to help you." Douglas officially introduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellerstin took a light breath and restrained his inner anxiety: "Two lords, I will briefly introduce you to the situation..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that there is almost no difference from what Douglas described: there is a gap in the forest to the abyss in Stroop, and there are demons from time to time, but the gap is not big enough. The "Abyss Will" and the legendary abyss prince can't come, and the demon kings are more inclined to kill each other without control. Therefore, the Elf Wang Ting and the Druid Presbyterian can easily guard, once Only one round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, the originally stable gap suddenly lost control and grew again. A large number of demons poured in with the demon king. Fortunately, it was Daru. Ima Fario was guarded, and there was no tragic result of the legendary fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of battle, the Elf King and the Druid Presbyterians rushed back to the abyss, temporarily sealing the gap, but this time, the Elf Queen The elf tree was found to be slightly polluted by the chaos and killing, and had to return to guard and clear. After that, a small number of elves began to degenerate and demonize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that the two of you can help us investigate the cause of the gap out of control and find ways to stabilize it. This will completely eliminate the abyss and control the magic. The spread, but regardless of the final result, our elves will send a heartfelt thanks." Ellerstin has more politeness and talk than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently: "I have to prepare and call some assistants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of things, there is no need to personally investigate the legend, send a high-level magician to go, this is also for the parliament to train talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, sir." Exxonk said in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original he was as bright as the sun, but what happened during this time made him restless, tired, and faint as the sun sets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
