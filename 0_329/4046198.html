			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council headquarters is in a glittering metal hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar has been laughing, almost breathless: "Lu Xien, Lucien, you didn't see Ms. Lauwet's face? Black It’s comparable to the iron stove in the desert in the south! It’s like just getting a hundred arcane points but being told that you’ve got the wrong person, haha, maybe the family is on fire, the savings are being looted... I’m really Happy! Many people hate her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a matter of doing it according to the responsibilities of the mission area. Why is it so difficult for her to do this? Understand her thoughts." Lucian smiled and shook his head, holding a tall book in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar caressed his chest and stopped smiling: "Ms. Lau Weit is the kind I have mentioned, I feel that I am thinking." Become dull, no one who promotes hope, so desperately want to have a rich and beautiful old age while leaving a precious legacy for the children and grandchildren. They see the magic that is still busy to improve their strength and knowledge. The teacher always looks like someone else owes her a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, actually I can understand them, but I hope that after I’m sixty years old, Don't be like them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to imagine Lazar, who is always full of sunshine and smiling, you will have that kind of hateful expression." Lucien I meditated, "Hey, so let's try it in advance, you borrow me from thirty Arcane points, and then I will pay you back a hundred years later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar took a look at Lucien: "This is my hard work to improve the harvest of magic. Lucien, do you have a heart? Oh, let's talk, Actually, I met the three little devils. I don’t know what they would look like?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the five magic schools of Allinge, the Douglas Magic School is the best. He is good at force field, electromagnetic, astrological and elemental, followed by Ariel's School of Magic and Bisanqiu Magic School. The former is good at death and summoning. The latter is good at deformation and illusion. The Trident Magic School mainly teaches the latest three factions. : Electromagnetic, thermal and light dark, Aalborg Magic School is alchemy, elements and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because they are all aimed at magic apprentices, each faction in each school has a teaching, but it is slightly biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy, then painful." Lucien answered affirmatively. "Next I have to buy a storage bag, or else I have to hold so many books." Trouble, and every time I carry the suitcase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Vasim alchemy shop, a hundred years of credibility..." Lazar immediately followed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Ordinary storage bag, three-level magic items, constant three-ring magic 'contraction', can be fixed according to sixteen to one Scales and stores items while reducing 80% of the weight and masking magical fluctuations, worth four hundred arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holding hands The black storage bag is really like a knife. I feel that my life is gray. I have spent three of my high-quality jellyfish and fifty-eight Jintales plus six arcane points. From the rich to the civilians, and the size of the palm, loaded with magic notes, books and magic materials, the space has already consumed most of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s faint convulsive face, Lazar smiled and comforted: “Lu Xien, don’t feel bad, if it’s not a standard magic item, The light is a three-level rating, you can't buy even a thousand arcane points! Since the alchemists have improved the craftsmanship and materials, the price of some commonly used magic items has dropped sharply. Besides, the storage bag is a must. It's worth spending on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I don't think Lu Xien has so many high-quality sea stones. If I need it later, buy it from you. Would it be cheaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, another week, after the release of the Ordinary Arcane Monthly, your arcane point The meeting has risen, and I don’t know how many arcans want to improve the magic that is rated as serious but has a surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazar Your clothes are also standard?" Lucien said slightly in a sudden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar’s expression replied solemnly: “The meaning of my magic robe system refers to style... Next, where are we going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to make up for the loss! Let a huge amount of books comfort my heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"What?! Can't browse in advance?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you consistently maintain Calm Wayne, I can't help but hear the news and ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is also related to Lucien’s lack of repression at the Magic Council headquarters. The surnames that were previously suppressed by life slowly surfaced, no longer Just calm and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little old man who manages the library sees the reaction of Lucien, and laughs and laughs: "Young people, your life experience is too little. As early as this foundation After the establishment of the Arcane Library for decades, there are magicians who use the powerful memory of the soul and spiritual power to remember the contents of the library books. Later, they created a magical array of magical fluctuations that are hard to detect. Record the books here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But knowledge is equal to strength, it is equal to wealth, how can they get it for free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white hair is mixed with black silk, the red pupil is a bit muddy, the appearance is slightly old, but in fact it is very spiritual, very temperament, no wrinkles, it is the kind of beautiful young man after the age The appearance of handsome, but unfortunately too short, half a head lower than Lucien, wearing a bright red and gorgeous ancient magic robe, the corner of the clothes is dragging on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his appearance is unusually wretched in the eyes of Lucien, and the mind seems to be thundered by lightning, so I don’t want to look at how I recorded the soul book. In the pavilion, why did the magician predecessors wait for me to come and do stupid attempts? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, if you can't browse ahead, how do I know what I want to learn?" Lucien tried to dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little old man stretched out his index finger and shook his head: "Young people, the excuses you find are the same as those of the original idiots." Then he patted the counter. Magical array, a blue smoke rises, the upper half turns into a rough man with a naked chest, wearing a black soft hat on his head, "Basic Arcane Library Management Giants Alex, say what you need Knowledge, he immediately tells you which books you can borrow, at what position, what is the content. He is a special alchemy life made with a fire giant and some soul fragments hidden in the lamp, focusing on memory." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome to you, Alex is sincerely serving you." Management giants are much more polite than the little old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucienk restrained the grief and tried to calmly ask: "How much does it cost to rent a book?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The library is only open to the inner magician of the parliament. The rent period for a book is seven days, ten silver narr." The management giant smiles slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So expensive?!" Lucien found that it was a robbery. Aalto bought a thick book for one or two Yinnar. Here is just ten Yinnars for renting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little old man’s expression shook his head in a wretched way: “Sorry, the young people now don’t understand the preciousness of knowledge! I wanted to see a new magical school. Either exchange it with your own magic book, or pay a price, at least dozens of Jintale's magic materials..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him has been 啰In the trend of squatting, Lazar quietly pulled himself behind his back. Lucien licked the temple and said: "Aside from a ten Yinnar, is there any other regulation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you pay two arcane points directly, you can borrow forty books in one month, each of which is seven days. Four arcane points are eighty books, in turn "The analogy." Alex said another way, "but in this case, you can't replace it with Jintal and other items, only the Arcane point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is half the price of the previous method, obviously encouraging the magicians to use the Arcane point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien wants to redeem the remaining three high-quality jellyfish, he can take into account the cost of his next experimental materials. The magic badge is handed to the little old man: "Take a rent of 40 copies a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little old man crossed the two arcane points with a magical array, magic The badge was handed to Lucien, and the expression was a little serious: "If you want to learn magic, don't spend money on books and experimental materials, and magic items are enough. You can ask Alex if you want to rent a book. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
