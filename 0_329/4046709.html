			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of Nesika and Samantha, the "Prophet" Begner began to predict this thing after a long preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the crystal ball in his hand fell to the ground, making a crisp and sweet sound, but fortunately this is a magical hammered item, not damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and looked at the crystal ball on the ground incredulously, muttering to himself: "Why is this... why is this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has seen no results in the prophecy, only a fog, as if the future will not be sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What interferes with my prediction?" After calming down, he thought in this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the theoretical basis of the astral system, the future fate is strictly determined by all current states. The prediction cannot be accurate because the prophet has limits and it is difficult to reach the "Tanos demon" "The omnipotent "highest level" will naturally have a fuzzy surname of prophecy, but no matter what, as long as it is not completely uninformed prophecy, more or less will see the corner of the future, like now, only fog, I can't see the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the controversy in the micro-domain, Bognier believes that he is fully informed enough to get some vague hints, who knows that things are beyond his expectations So he has to think about other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Moon comes with the gradual fading heat, Holt The magicians in the School of Magic are waiting for the new issue of "Arcane", "Magic", "Nature" and other journals - after a few months, the magic apprentices who passed the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools" Most of them have been promoted to the magician here, and the promotion ratio is as high as three to two. This also makes the Holt School of Magic full of magical apprentices, and makes the "Uniform Entrance Examination" cast a mysterious veil, as if It is the standard for identifying whether a magic apprentice can become a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at Douglas Magic School, in the magic schools of various divisions, in the magic apprentice group, such as "High School of Magic Unified Entrance Examination Simulation Test" "Ivan Books such as Smith's Volume began to be popular, and girls such as Heidi, Reyia, and Ophelia made a fortune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the course of "Special Relativity", Ernesto went into the classroom and distributed the journal to the magicians. This time, his expression was normal. I am so happy that I don’t have to learn the troublesome matrix mechanics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His relaxed attitude infected the students, knowing that there is no subversion of the content in the journal, so he opened the page casually, but looked at it, Honoré, Clark and others couldn't contain the surprise expression and greedily learn the contents inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue of "Arcane", two of the first three papers are Brooke, one is Oliver, etc. They started from the wave equation and solved The problem of the hydrogen atom model is consistent with many experimental data. A new alchemy system that seems to be quite different from the matrix mechanics is initially constructed, and it is simpler, more intuitive, more vivid, and makes people feel the charm of arcane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the arcane..." Honoré whispered a sigh. "Even in the entire field of electromagnetics and elements, the Oliver-Brook wave equation is absolutely Can be ranked in the top three classic formula, this is a really great achievement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark also followed: "I am moved to see this wave equation Tears, this is the arcane, not a complicated mathematical monster. In the past few months, I have only applied the matrix mechanics initially, and I can’t understand it at all, but only this month’s research on the wave equation and just reading the paper, I It seems as if I have a preliminary understanding of the internal structure of the atom and understand the microscopic field. It turns out that everything is so fascinating!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the wave dynamics established by the two of you It is developed from the classical arcane theory. It is not completely abandoned. It uses mathematical methods to 'think'. The results of Lord Evans are genius, but they are too genius, so that we are 'normal people'. Unimaginable and difficult to understand. Next to the students took the Buddist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onore continued to look at the paper, and sincerely said: "The next year, I will focus on this, I can’t wait every day. It, studying its mystery, hey, Lord Oliver put forward the theory of why electrons can show the particle surname, 'wave packet'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this explanation, the waver said that supporter Clark is more rejoicing and believes that this is the real axiom of the microscopic field, revealing the most profound laws in the quantum field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is trying to say that the particle name was originally contained in the volatility, and the papers behind Douglas, Fernando, Hathaway, Helen and others jumped into him. The line of sight, they roughly prove that the wave dynamics and matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent, and give some changes in the amount of arcane that does not conform to the multiplication commutative law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The two new alchemy systems are equivalent..." Clark couldn't help but blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onore also saw this part: "The proof of Lord Douglas is the clearest, but it seems to be not rigorously mathematically...they are equivalent, then The volatility surname and the particle surname are also equivalent? Is the microscopic particle really as new as we have yet to say, as we have asserted by Evans, that the original concept cannot be applied and can only be described from the actual results."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because he has read these papers, but they themselves admit that there is still a lack of a rigorous mathematical method to rigorously prove equivalence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is." Clark was slightly depressed, but after the electron diffraction experiment, he had already accepted this explanation, and it was not too repulsive, so Cheers: "Since it is equivalent, then we will only use wave dynamics in the future, do not care about that damn math monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "There are many magicians around to answer in unison." Clarke laughed and looked at Honorley. "You guessed that the new alchemy textbook had to be changed last month. I said it was impossible, but I I sincerely apologize, I am wrong, I am very happy that I am wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first time to change the teaching materials of alchemy..." Although Nore is delighted, he also feels the sense of suffocation that changes like a storm. In such an era, if you don’t work hard, you will be abandoned and you will never be able to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took the time to start the class and continued to look at several journals, eyes again: "Electronic spin model hypothesis?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Hey, a good explanation of the abnormal phenomenon, but the surface rotation speed is ten times faster than the speed of light, which violates the special theory of relativity!" Clark did not see the specific content , only concerned about the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the same horror in the classroom, they can hardly imagine such a paper can be said to be rigorously known as "Arcane", but as they look down, they find Annick and Sprint have another paper. They use matrix mechanics to deal with the spin problem. The results are unquestionable. They also saw that Evans wrote a paper on matrix mechanics on the spin problem. Through this model, it is accurately predicted that the calculated value of one experiment is wrong, and the other side confirms the correctness of the spin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also probably explained the problem of surface rotation speed, which makes people less resistant to spin theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Annick and Sprint’s spin models have not been too violently questioned, on the one hand, because they are using Lu’s embarrassment Before the matrix mechanics processing, it was only submitted for review, not publicly published, and it was supported by Lucian's thesis. On the other hand, the focus of the current Arcanists was on the wave dynamics of the new birth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, the four quantum numbers of Fernando's incompatibility theory are all in one." Honoré found almost every few months of the journal. The articles are all papers that can be ranked in front of "Arcane" a dozen years ago. But now, they are either very backward or can only go to journals such as "Magic". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark remembered another thing: "One of the two papers by Lord Evans is about spin, and the other is about previous Chloe statistics. In addition, no paper is about wave dynamics, will this be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They remembered the past and the past, such silence seems to contain A storm of terror, when Evans has a paper on wave dynamics, is it a red and white storm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it proves that the two new alchemy systems are equivalent, it should be irrelevant..." Honoré comforted himself optimistically, then he deeply Sucked a breath: "The correctness of wave dynamics is beyond doubt. The interpretation of the wave function was also proposed by Lord Oliver. It seems that the second Evans Arcane Award will be awarded to this achievement."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
