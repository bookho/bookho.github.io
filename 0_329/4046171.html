			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Soge Wax Museum is dark and the light is not strong, so that a statue of a wax placed on both sides of the glass looks the same as a real person, which makes people very surprised. In addition to the appreciation, there will be doubts about whether it is a living person, and the feeling of trepidation in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my wax figure is a bit darker on the skin." Viscount Wright pointed to his black dress wax figure to Soge and Granny Laughing, "Mr. Soge, your skill is really extraordinary. If I stand here with it at night, others will definitely not know who is the wax figure who is the real person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because of the impact of the previous "terrorist" attack, Soge's face has been bad, and now it is only after the praise of the Viscount Wright, only slightly restored: "The Viscount, this is a wax figure that you customized when you returned from Holm Kingdom. At that time, your skin was like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Wright laughed happily: "Mr. Soge, you remember when you said it. It was In July, the sun was fierce, I was a great knight, and the people in the same boat even turned into bronzed skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the Viscount and you, I almost didn't know each other.” Granny laughed and flattered, then carefully looked around not far behind. Harrison appreciation of wax? Brown, "The Viscount, the previous attack seems to be directed at the Brown Knight. I don't know if there is any follow-up? Oh, I am not a knight, I have no ability to protect myself, so I am worried."<br /><br /> Viscount Wright sorted out the collar and looked at Granny, and didn't care too much: "Don't worry, although they want to kill Brown, they can't bear to fight hard, or send a person directly." The mid-level magician and knight mix in this occasion, 100% can kill Brown. The only problem is that the magician and the knight will definitely be surrounded by the night watchman and we can't escape. For the magic parliament Said, this is a completely uneconomical business. Even if there is an attack, it should be mainly caused by chaos and long-range attacks. Oh, Granny, I will give priority to protecting you this incompetent attendant." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gryneuve has always claimed that he is a loyal servant of the Viscount, and the Viscount Wright did not mind calling him so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown, who appreciates the aristocratic wax figure in the distance, heard the conversation between the two, and relaxed more and more, yeah, to kill himself The quasi-knight, the magic parliament is absolutely unwilling to pay a big price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, in addition to the human body wall that the followers intentionally or unintentionally formed, Lucien carried a black suitcase and praised the simulation of the wax figure. Go over them and walk towards the depths of the Wax Museum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wide and dark wax museum, Lucien found an unmanned corner, where the glass windows were empty and belonged to those A wax figure has not yet been made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computed the distance from them to Brown, Lucien put the black suitcase in a corner that is hard to detect, and then took out the Jintaler inside to put it In the purse, pry the mezzanine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten blazing glues, a pack of common gunpowder, and a long rope that is tens of laps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These blazing rubbers are not ordinary blazing rubber, but the explosive power is even more terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien borrowed sulfuric acid, nitric acid and other materials and alchemy equipment from the "ferry", under the dual protection of Starlight Shield and Yanyang Bodyguard Some nitroglycerin was made in combination with animal fats and added to the blazing gum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, since the first preparation of blazing rubber, Lucien has been trying to improve its explosive power, initially because it has no protective ability. So I didn't start. After I became a formal magician and got the bracelet of the weavers, Lucien continued to analyze and improve the magic formula of the fire rubber on the road. When I arrived at the Djibouti Principality, I finally had satisfactory results, just because of the materials. And the experimental device is not easy, and it has only come in handy until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why nitroglycerin is not used directly is because Lucien needs the magical fluctuations generated by the blazing rubber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the glass tube of the "improved" blazing rubber is engraved with a magic rune to prevent it from swaying, Lucine puts the pack of ordinary gunpowder Next to it, connect with the long rope, then close the black suitcase and wrap the long rope around the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope with the added special substance began to burn, stable and balanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pressed the black top hat, buried his head, and quickly walked out of this uninhabited corner, facing the front area of ​​the wax museum where the nobles were concentrated. Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, the silent burning sound is not rushing in the place where the wax figure is still not there, and Lucien hurried away. Two minutes later, the group of aristocrats could already be seen. Some of them were still enjoying their wax figures, while others were trying to agree with Soge on the time of making wax figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not far away from the glass window watching this noisy scene, now the person who comes in must be watching the wax in front, unless it is This kind of thoughtful person will go to the remote place behind: "There is still a minute, it should not be discovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Brown looks at those The vivid wax figure is hot and red. If the wax figure can be collected by the city museum in the future, there is no regret in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Mr. Soge?" Brown looked around and looked for Soge and found that he was surrounded by a group of small nobles on the left hand side and was negotiating a custom wax figure. Things, and the great aristocrats such as Viscount Wright are behind the double wax figure of Baron Monkach and his wife. I think it’s best to confirm the appointment of wax figures. Brown used his eyes to signal the adventurer’s night watchman. Go a few steps forward to Soge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was walking, he accidentally saw a black-haired black-skinned young man wearing a tall black hat and a monocular on his left eye. Looking at the wax figure, I couldn't help but laugh: "The style of clothing popular in the Holm Kingdom has slowly affected Stewark in recent years. Many aristocrats feel that such a dress is elegant and solemn."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the idea emerged, Brown had turned his head and stood next to Soge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer's night watchman followed closely, blocking Brown's left hand side, always ready to prepare for a surprise attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fiveteen seconds, fourteen seconds..." Lucien pushed the monocle away, left the glass window and walked toward Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Six seconds, five seconds..." Lucien was parallel to Brown, but it went straight ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking forward, count the time: "Four seconds, three seconds..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Brown smiled at Sog, "Mr. Soge, don't know when I can come over..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two seconds, one second..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom, the violent explosion screamed fierce waves, and the whole building seemed to tremble, blocking Brown’s words halfway back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horrible sound is like a collection of countless explosions, difficult to distinguish clearly, and the majestic and fiery magical fluctuations are clear and turbulent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind speed in that corner may have changed, the explosion took place one second later than Lucien’s pre-calculation, but Lucien, who has been on high alert and waiting When the explosion, the sense of vibration, and the magical fluctuations just appeared, they reacted more quickly than everyone else to the side of the long-awaited magical charm of "humanity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal: Brown! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the "Book of Necronomics", Lucien analyzed his imaginary roots and several magics and found that he was not very familiar with it and was not very good at it. In addition to the state of the soul, most of the necrotic magic that affects emotion, reason, and spirit has a partial structure that releases electromagnetic waves directed at specific brain waves to affect hormone secretion and sensory judgment, thereby achieving the goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with this knowledge, Lucien changed the magic of "magic human" in two ways. One improvement is to reduce the part of the electromagnetic wave and enhance the part of the soul. The effect on the magician will be more obvious, but not only the magical fluctuations are strong, but it is also easy to be found that this person is charmed. Another improvement is to reduce the part of the soul and enhance the electromagnetic wave structure, which will affect the brain wave more easily. It is very suitable for those who are not strong enough to deal with the soul that is not strong enough, but when it comes to the formal magician, this improved magic Not much effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
