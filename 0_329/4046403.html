			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of silver-gray armor, Lucien with metal gloves in his hands, shimmering a layer of cold luster under the illumination of the underground palace In the eyes of Andris, it is like the most terrible demon in the world. He hasn't figured out what happened just now, why he suddenly lost, and the official knight's armor given by the family can't even block a sword. Come down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the aristocratic sons such as Jocelyn, like the operas that promote the northern church and promote various cults at the St. Soul Theatre in Antietre, completely subconscious I refuse to believe that Borak, who was a high-ranking knight who was a member more than a month ago, is so powerful that it is so unimaginable? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not long after the promotion of the Cavaliers. Jocelyn is proud of her two three-level magical daggers and a four-level perfect rose scale. And other magical items such as necklaces, talisman, belts, boots, gloves, etc., I want to hold the violently slashed hands with a giant sword like Borac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He must have an extraordinary item that can raise his strength to a five-level knight. The long sword that emits a strong chill is at least three, and he Absolutely stimulated the blood power, the Cavaliers level is even higher than me! Hidden well!" Jocelyn thought with amazement, a sense of shame and humiliation came to my mind, Borak at least a year ago inspired the blood Otherwise, it is impossible to upgrade to the second level so quickly, he actually concealed me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if "Bolak" can complete a full set of knight equipment that enhances strength, agility, balance, physique, will, and recovery speed, Cavalier experience, knight's battle The reaction is also impossible to simulate the extraordinary items. From the easy movement of his accurate grasp of the two-handed sword, Jocelyn can clearly judge that he has stimulated the blood power and is a real knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jocelin couldn’t help but envy: "Uncle Beckman is worthy of being a young child who has been favored by the old Duke. The contents of Borak are far better than me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born noble, her father was a big aristocrat at the top of the empire, and the family took control of a small territory, possessing the wealth that ordinary nobles could not reach, and accumulated for many years. The extraordinary items of the order are not uncommon. But it is not uncommon. Because there is no caster, it is impossible to refine the articles on its own. The type of equipment is very monotonous. For example, she is good at double swords, and there are only five swords and warhammers in the family treasure house and the Marquis private collection. Make up a pair of three-level magical daggers, and there is nothing more than a powerful force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared, the gorse family that inherits the Sun King's bloodline often has bloody warlocks, plus hidden magic books, alchemy manuals, etc. The types of medium and low-level extraordinary items are comparable to those of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she did not know that after Beckman’s death, the extraordinary items around him disappeared mysteriously, otherwise Borak would be so frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He became a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous exclamations are passed from the side to the ear, Jocelyn from her own In the spiritual world, he was "pulled" out, and then saw a few aristocratic children around him who had not yet ignited the blood power to escape, and no one dared to save Andris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They jumped up and down like a flying cock and a wild dog, and compared to the "Bolac" in the corridor that is as stable as the mountains, Jocellin came out from the heart. Strong disgust, a group of cowards, waste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is confident that Borak will not hurt himself, Jocelyn is worried that he will do something "uncontrollable" and will be seen by Alten, so Two stilettos that roamed the holy light crossed and stepped back in an orderly manner, leaving from the other door, and as she "expected", Borak did not pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was so dangerous and nervous, I was thinking about the equipment of Borak, and I was sighing at the richness of the superb items of the gorse family. If it weren't for him, things would be It’s very dangerous, hey, this is the drawback of not having experienced the real battle. When you shouldn’t think about it, you’re thinking about it!” After retreating to another corridor, Jocelyn deeply reflected on herself, so she also relied on herself. The blood stimulated by power, "But is Borak still so attractive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No catch up, watched the nobles flee, let Andris live The ground shivered, Lucien had no interest in defeating them, and the more people, the more chaotic, the more helpful they were to their actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the crisp applause sounded, and a wonderful figure wearing a close-fitting white armor stood up and proudly stood up: "The princess who needs the guardian of the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Sophia, she holds the green wand, smiles and says: "I didn't expect you to have successfully stimulated the blood and become a real knight. Will you guard me this poor princess, dear knight? You The action of holding the giant sword was so handsome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was unexpected, but she was not surprised at her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always been a knight of the princess." Lucien meant to salute, but even if Sophia was smarter, he could not guess his true thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied nodded, Sophia looked curiously and shyly at the naked Andreus: "The control of your sword is really good, I thought You will cut all the protruding parts of his body, oh, ugly." Without the left hand of the magic wand, he lifted his eyes and covered his eyes, and he could clearly see the flashing green between the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess of the "Goddess" in the heart saw her appearance, and she was ridiculed by her ignorance. Andris was really blushing, thinking of death. There are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, my Royal Highness, we have to hurry." Lucien always thought that Sophia knew something about the underground palace, so she simply let her follow it. Undercover "observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she and Bayer came in, Lucien had a hunch for something to change - this is a starry magic that hasn’t done anything yet. A high-order astrologer's hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia regained her gaze and walked to Lucien with a burst of fragrance: "Well, let me study the changes in the underground palace, dear knight, remember to guard me!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucien and Sophia left, Andris, who buried his face on the ground, raised his head, and his face rose red. Qu and shame! And "Bolaq" completely forgotten him, did not send him seriously injured and sent out the attitude of the underground palace, but also made him deeply indignant, and was completely despised by the indignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Andris, what are you doing on the floor with your ass? Is it? Hahahaha!" The familiar exaggerated voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andris’s girl squatted and jumped up. Looking back, the few companions who had just escaped quietly dive back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, you are like this, if you are seen by Jocelyn, you think we are up to you!" A nobleman gave a smirk of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andris, aren’t you bragging that you are the strongest in the high-ranking knight attendants? And there is the official knight armor! How can you even have a sword? Can't stop it? Also, 'take off' the clothes and lie in front of him?" The aristocratic youth who usually did not agree with Andris sneered at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how did Borak hurt you and let you be sent out of the underground palace? Did you just..." Another nobleman smiled slyly Tao, he has experienced different pleasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of aristocratic youth who have not undergone rigorous training and like luxury and enjoyment have no hesitation about Andreus’s mood to express his emotions after his extreme fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andris double-handedly held tightly, and the laughter of his companions was like a spurt arrow hitting his heart, the forehead blood vessels Swelling, the eyes are blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of damn bastards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just left me running away!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also laugh at me and think of me as that kind of person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was actually There is such a big ugly under the princess temple!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shame, anger, hate Emotional shocks such as hatred and so on have a blood red in the pupil of Andris, and there seems to be a burst of sound in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
