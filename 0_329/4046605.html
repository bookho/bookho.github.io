			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder and Hell", the interior of Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life talisman is violently transparent, blooming with a clean brilliance, a bloody intestine twisted and squirming and splitting growth, after an hour, the storm dominated again It changed back to its original appearance, and after another two hours, his strength slowly returned to the legendary third-order level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on the usual bright red magic robe, and insert a strange false eye like a vortex in the storm into the left eyelid, Fernando opens." Thunder Hell" is a node that connects with the outside world. This is not because he does not trust Douglas, Hathaway, Lucien, etc., but the most basic vigilance of a legendary magician who has lived for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The node is open, and after half a minute, the transmission beam lights up, and Lucien’s figure appears in the Thunder hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So come back so early?" Fernando smiled slyly. "I thought you would have a good celebration with Natasha."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Lucien is very used to the teacher’s injustice, he is a little bit flushed: "Prince Patrick was ordered to be killed by the old king, and Natasha is not in a good mood. I comforted her for a while, then the Lord of the Nightmare King sent the Grand Duke of Vaolirit. Their father and daughter had not seen each other for a long time. I was also worried about how the teacher recovered, so he rushed back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you worried about? I can go out and fight with the saints of the church again." Fernando once again showed his storm-like momentum, then shook his head. "It’s not too strange to happen in the royal family. The little girl still knows too little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees Lucien so leisurely, can still enter Nexus Palace comforted Natasha, naturally understand that the short-lived war is over and the results are very good, so there is no Not wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien still looked at Fernando a little worried: "Teacher, how do I feel that you are hurt more than the Holy Avengers? It seems to be a step backwards?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not show his momentum, but when he showed it, Lucien felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The trauma of the soul spreads a little bit here, but it is only temporary, and it will be restored in a year or two." Fernando said it first, suddenly blowing The beard blinked in the eye. "Mermos is stronger than me, but in my complete state, it will not be heavier than him! This time it is only two legendary items not brought, the puppets prepared in advance, the avatar The mirror and other surnames are also used to entangle the five saints, and the defensive legendary magic is broken by them, so they are more injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is also the reason why he faced the Pope in the third-order when he was consciously injured and escaped. After all, legendary items and life-defense defensive legends are numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient magic empire summed up some things that could not be explained by the existing arcane theory based on the fall of many legendary magicians, such as the sword of truth can directly Killing the soul and killing all the fallen soul fragments along the mysterious connection. For example, when the purely violent energy attack exceeds a certain limit, the destruction of the ontological soul will also hurt the resurrection device in some mysterious way. The soul fragments, if the energy goes up a step, and the magician does not make effective defense, it will even cause a complete fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient magicians named it "causal line damage", which is equivalent to the principle of some curses. As for the facts, no one can study thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the "Eternal Blazing Sun" explosion center, the current opinion of the Supreme Council is that too much energy will affect time and space, causing chaos in the causal line, so Will only cut the weight, afraid to kill Fernando together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not very convinced of this explanation, but can not think of other reasons for the time being. The research in the field of the soul is still far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes." Lucien knows that the teacher has always been a strong self-respect, never praised other people's magicians, of course, nodded and nodded, transferred the topic, "Speaking of this, in order to trap the five saints, the parliament has really used up many years of accumulation. It may not be possible to use this suicidal method to achieve miraculous effects in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to lose more people, in addition to planning, all kinds of emergency preparations, in order to take the initiative to passive, the key moments will be willing to use items and reels to smash, do not want to spend money, it is going to die!" Fernando The rich and powerful appearance, but the unsteady storm in his eyes sold out his heart. "If there is no separation and puppet, I will bring the robes of the ruler, and then sacrifice it to entangle the five saints, but In this way, the parliament will have to compensate me for a legendary item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, apart from the wonders of the road to Sean, the legendary items are legendary powers. Owned, but the Magic Council has organized many times to explore the half-face of the ancient magician, and find out the remains of the legendary mage who died due to various accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary items obtained and the legendary items commissioned by the cherished materials obtained are owned by the parliament and are run by the Archer of Aringe, Members of the parliament who make a special contribution or accumulate a large amount of wealth can be exchanged, and members of the highest panel can borrow one piece at a certain cost when going out or taking risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently four publicly-recognized items, and the exchange price is too high for even the legendary magician to accept, and only two cases of special contributions are recognized. It is the kind of Fernando's mouth. The first is the confirmed system of arcane theory that changed the times. Fernando's robes of the ruler were obtained in this way. When the Arcanists emerged a few hundred years ago, the legendary items of the parliament It is almost not enough. With the development of heterogeneous space in recent decades, the growth of rare materials has been filled by the creators and alchemists after several failures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deeply realized the feeling of using money to kill people. Although the church is far richer than the parliament, the alchemy is still too far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not say anything else, and asked the result of the battle: "How many of the five saints have fallen? What is the final result?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien will probably be described again, Fernando listens to the cold and if it is not Melmos, the four saints will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lecture, Fernando frowned slightly: "We haven’t fallen into a legend. It’s good, but the new pope climbs to the level of the gods. Surprisingly, if the Pope is determined to have the patronage of the God of Truth, why does He not directly kill all the magicians present? Since all of them have lowered their grace, it is very simple to take another punishment."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the pope died when his life was over, and he had enough time to pick and train successors. Even so, the new pope would take at least a year to become a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if the pope is really the spokesperson of the god of truth, you can get the grace of God, what is the split Northern Church, Holm State?" Why is it still possible to use the gods, why can the Pope still use 'God'?" Lucien also expressed his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando meditation: "I think of a wrong place, the new pope is the legendary peak in a year, so why are several gods from these centuries? Did not try to seize this opportunity, the defense of the holy city Lance can hold a class of gods, can not stop the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shake When I shook my head, this kind of thing asked Silver Moon, and I certainly couldn’t get an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anasta, who has not yet officially took office, holds the Platinum Scepter and stands in front of the remaining Cardinal members. He said: "The Magic Council colludes with the Abyss Devil." Fortunately, the Pope sacrificed himself, practiced the Lord's Word, repelled the will of the abyss, and saved countless pure spirits. I will inherit his will and completely eliminate evil!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the name and propaganda for this incident. The coastal corridors of the four countries and the Northland have been lost. The roots must be stabilized, and a pope who sacrifices himself to save the world. It must have been loved by believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos looked at him, his heart sorrowful, two of the eight saints fell, one betrayed and one became the pope, actually Only half of the past, the pastor of the Holy Spirit, fell one, missing three, the entire cardinal group members only 16 left, but fortunately, the king of angels are ready to stay in the world for a short time to help the church through the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
