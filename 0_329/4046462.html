			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes are slightly picked up, and the monocle reflects the cold light of the early spring: “Don’t think that sending anonymous letters, scraping journal articles, using prophecies The spell has processed the letter, I can't find your fate track? You underestimate the ability of high-order astrology, this is not a prediction of the illusory future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pick this anonymous letter out and press it under the crystal ball of morning light. Lucien put his hands on it with a cold expression and touched it with a specific rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball dissipates and quickly becomes dark, with a little bit of starry light inside, bright and clean, and at the same time, Lucien’s left hand wrist wears the "Arcane Right" The "stick" watch casts a layer of starlight, and the sun and the zodiac sign quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars are intertwined, and a vague picture emerges. It is every link of this anonymous letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Owl", "Aringer Animal Post Office", "Subordinates' Magic Steam Train Company", "Magic Steam Train", "Rail Track" "A scene of woods, fields, hills and scenery", "Capital of the capital of Calais", "extraordinary magic apprentice", "friends' request"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general link of the letter was reflected one by one, and finally returned to Aringe, returned to the animal post office, and returned to an ordinary restaurant waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process consumes most of the mental power of Lucien, and the picture becomes more and more blurred, and it will dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another scene emerged, only to be vaguely seen a person wearing a black robes with a hood handing the letter and Quintal The ordinary restaurant waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand reflects the innumerable pure light of the "original" ring. A clear touch of the ring, Lucien's spiritual strength suddenly recovers a little, the right hand leaves the crystal ball , lifted up the scepter inlaid with a huge sun stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sun Scepter" can enhance the effect of the magic of the stars below the 9th Ring! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines brightly, the picture is sharp and clear, and the magician who covers his face with a black hood, a strangely distorted, illusory star emerges behind him. It is possible to directly see with the naked eye the path of the connection between his main star of destiny and the trajectory of the nebula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Catch you." Lucien sighed, then recorded the characteristics and trajectory of his fate, and waited until the mental power recovered. The ability of the "Sun Scepter" and "Arcane Scepter" to enhance the effects of astrology probably determines the identity of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pivi? Bergos, a member of the Silver Moon Alliance, specializes in electromagnetic spells, and is self-conscious..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;?nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu Xien suddenly felt that the name is a bit familiar, after careful recall, only to find that it was a "qualified" paper that had been "corrected" some time ago, the "civilian arcane master." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So hate me, and then be stimulated by this light quantum hypothesis, this is writing intimidation?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After not predicting the future that cannot be seen clearly, and there are countless links of important items in hand, the ability of astrology, especially high-order astrology, is definitely more than the imagination of low- and medium-level magicians, and Lucy There is also the aid of the "Sun Scepter" and "Arcane Scepter", which is almost a great mage. The most important thing is that Pivi belongs to the Magic Council. His fateful star character is not a secret. Search for comparison. It is not difficult to determine identity - each has a fateful star, but does not learn the magic of the star system, there is no reflection of the main star of the soul within the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien is doing things now, and is trying to eliminate all important traces. It is impossible to use high-level magic to cover his own destiny, or to represent black holes. That group turned to the front, no one except Fernando and the soup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Submit the anonymous letter and the results of the prophecy to the Panel? Intimidation is a minor violation of the rules, at most the penalty arcade and the confession prison for fifteen days, not only It will scare people who really have this mind, and it will also help the other person's anger, making him lose his mind." Lucian looked at the results of the prophecy, wondering how to deal with this obviously over-excited guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you can be over-excited, I can also make a radical reaction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is an anonymous letter and prophecy testimony, and the excessive defense also has more penalty points. And the banned prison for half a year." Lucien thought with a sigh of relief, then found out the material, according to the information of Pivi, made the medium of casting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Lucien had a brown-yellow secret puppet in his hand. His eyes were narrow and narrow, his mouth was closed, his arms fell to his knees, his body and his face were full. It is a unique pattern, which is very similar to the trajectory of the main star of Pivi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's best not to have any thoughts, otherwise..." Anonymous letters are wrapped around this expressionless puppet, Lucien's expression is flat In a sentence, inspired the left hand of the "Arcane Scepter" watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zodiac constellation and the hourly sun pattern as the time mark are all bright, bright and bright, pure and cold, and there is no change in the age... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven-ring star-like magic, "Destiny Interference"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The puppet face without life and no surname suddenly produced a layer of human skin, twisted and turned into a pico, but his eyes closed. Nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien began to release magic to the "Pivi Puppet". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the garden villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pivi is comfortably watching the melody of the latest opera, thinking of Lucien? Evans saw his face in the face of an anonymous letter. He thought that he would panic and ask each friend's students for peace. When he thought of his angry grievances when he submitted the anonymous letter to the committee, his mood became better and better: "Let You scold me, attack me, suppress me! Let you arbitrarily correct my great achievements! Let you review failed! Let you dare to attack the great Brooke system!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He evaded astrology with all the means he could master, and based on the data of the astrological system he had read, at least the legendary magician could lock himself on the basis of an anonymous letter that could not be destroyed - if the anonymous letter was attached to the self-destructive array, Magical fluctuations, Lu Xien will not even look at it, then lose the original intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not mention a letter of intimidation that is too radical. It’s not worth asking the legendary magician to use astrology. Even if it is locked, I don’t know how many arcanes. When the teacher sent Lu Xien a threatening letter, he did not punish some arcane points, closed for ten days, and verbally apologized. There would be no substantial surname loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the magician who insists on volatility will stand on my side and put a lot of pressure on you! I will not believe that your friends and students are not going out to explore, Adventure, they will always have a forced surname after they become a middle class? I don't believe that I can't find a chance! This is the result of swearing and attacking my great achievements, the great electromagnetic system of Brooke, and only the blood can make you awake. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression is distorted, complaining, killing the father and self-talking, as if Lucien blocked his path to becoming a great arcian, and It also attacks the foundation of its own cognitive world, and as a veteran, four-ring magician who is good at fighting, he has enough confidence in this, and some relics, some places, as long as the traces are handled, even the legendary magic The astrology of the division may not be able to get results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But before that, I had to do an accurate photoelectric effect experiment, just now I was inspired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, when I use this precise experimental result to explode the head of Lucien, my genius will be valued by everyone, and then my theory will be the same as that of Brook’s electromagnetic system. The pillars of the parliament, I will also become a high arcade master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his own laboratory, Pivi found himself very awake, various processes, improved methods They all appeared clearly in their minds, and then began to transform the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this kind of high-level magician has to spend a few months to complete the transformation, I actually got it in ten minutes, is my talent finally unconstrained? The external suppression broke out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation of the magic array and the alchemy device, Pivi began experimenting, collecting data, and observing the fluorescence image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
