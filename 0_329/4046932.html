			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experimental tower is white and icy, and does not quite match the gloomy overall image of the Heidele School of Magic. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not far from the teaching tower. There are seven or eight gray-white bridges in the middle. From time to time, students wearing black magic robes can come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of Greenton’s mentor, Downey and others walked outside a seemingly large lab that took up this whole layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many very interesting experiments in the electromagnetic field, such as the current in the cutting magnetic field, such as invisible and non-magnetic electromagnetic waves... I used to communicate with my brother. Experiment, that time was in the ocean outside the Pearl Islands..." Carl shared his experimental experience with Downey with pleasure, and the silver-purple eyes swayed with warm light and became more and more irritating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is now fully alert and subconsciously asks: "How is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He didn't care what Karl did, and only concerned about what happened to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The results are perfect, fully achieved, and exceeded expectations!" Carl's pointed chin was slightly lifted, a proud look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the normal experimental results, what are the consequences?" Downey asked with vigilance, not confused by Carl's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karlhaha laughed and said: "Which consequences, we also provided a new field of research for the Electromagnetic Arcane Master, which is artificially induced by electromagnetic waves. The fall of high-altitude lightning, which can greatly improve the power of high-order spells in the electromagnetic system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you induce?" Downey was very surprised that he was The good students of the "Nature Heart" Magic School are no strangers to the electromagnetic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Karl replied eagerly, seemingly unwilling to be questioned about lying. "At the time, the number of lightnings we induced was not clear, almost formed. A thunderbolt forest, several uninhabited islands nearby are also burning..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he suddenly shut up and sneered: "All my father anyway Say there is theoretical support, but it is best to use electromagnetic waves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey turned a deaf ear to his words, muttering to himself: "Thunder forest... The island burns..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to wait as far as possible from Karl. If he remembers correctly, Karl’s previous experiment was electromagnetic wave communication, not induced lightning... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Greenton stopped and said with a clean expression: "If you want to learn the knowledge of the electromagnetic field, electromagnetic induction is a phenomenon that cannot be avoided. So I am taking you today to complete a few small experiments of electromagnetic induction to help you create an intuitive impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to remind you that you must strictly abide by the experimental specifications in the magic laboratory, otherwise it will hurt others and hurt yourself, if anyone is found to have not followed I will impose strict punishments. As for the specific experimental norms, I believe that you are no stranger. The five-year magic school experience has integrated the foundation of this foundation into your soul, and today's experiments have no other need to increase. I will not repeat them one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he turned and his eyes were covered with red, then two red lights. Shooting, hit the door of the laboratory, stirred up a burst of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he took out his own "White Skull Badge" and pressed it in the center of the ,, so the door slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of dangerous experiments here, so you can't open it without the help of a tutor. If you want to experiment alone, you can only apply for one to seven layers. General laboratory." Greenton explained the sentence casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey in the crowd whispered in a worried voice: "What if there are problems with strict adherence to the experimental specifications..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously is not talking about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And, the Heidele School of Magic has been established for 21 years, and the experimental accidents that occurred during the teaching process are still full of a piece of parchment. The most serious one is just destroying an alchemy platform.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the pride of the entire college tutor, and the harvest of our 'cool road.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes , Greenton mentor." Downey replied quickly, he did not want to leave a bad impression in the mind of the instructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout of this lab is not significantly different from the primary magic lab that Downey and others have experienced, just a lot of alchemy instruments and magic arrays with unknown functions. Of course, there are also many devices that are familiar to students such as Downey but have never seen before, such as the silver-gray "electromagnetic cyclotron." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Carl’s chance to look around, Donnie quietly “sneaked” to the other side and made sure his position was not far from the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, seeing Carl didn’t come to find himself, but excitedly went to the corner, Downey’s long sigh of relief, but more Worried about what kind of "transformation" Carl will make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirits caused the attention of several classmates next to him, a brown-haired girl smiled and said: "Don’t be afraid, this is with us in the magic school. There is no difference in the experiment. Don't worry, the instructor will not let us use the alchemy device such as electromagnetic cyclotron today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't say beautiful, but the facial features are dignified, often with a smile , has a very good affinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, my name is Downey, what about you?" Downey replied politely, while secretly groaning, I was not worried about this problem, but actually In the "dangerous"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl laughed and said: "You can call me Shirley, I am from the Principality of Vaolirit, I hope that your host is welcome."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is a typical Holm look, so Shirley is just joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Vaurit Principality has returned to Natasha’s control, she is also a granddaughter, but rumors will not take long, she will take this title Pass to the youngest child - she and the great Arcanist Lucien? Evans's children have always been kept secret from the public. They rarely appear on TV shows, "the voice of mystery", etc. Even if they need to be mentioned, they are replaced by land and knights, such as Prince Edenberg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter which country is a member of the parliament, it is an admirer of knowledge, regardless of the owner and the guest." Downey is very graceful Answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the school of magic, because of Sami’s relationship, his own surname and his full commitment to learning, he rarely communicated with girls, so with Sami When I am awake, when I meet a girl, I will panic, but Shirley’s kind and amiable girl makes him less cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley nodded and quietly pointed to Greenton’s mentor, indicating that he had to concentrate on the lecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don's still worried about it, but he still invested in learning and hopes to become a formal magician as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenton in front of the laboratory, using the development water curtain to explain the discovery, development and current general situation of electromagnetic induction, from time to time to demonstrate the experiment and let the students They repeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is worthy of being the instructor that Carl has introduced. Although his attitude is serious, his lectures are fun and easy to understand. He quickly attracted Downey and let him Forgot the existence of Carl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening, Donnie suddenly felt that the sky outside was dark, like a cloud, and there seemed to be any invisible light in the lab. The cycle name is repeatedly oscillated, causing heavy depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is it going to rain?" Downey did not think strangely, the sight before the storm, everyone has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking about it, his expression suddenly solidified, looked up and looked out carefully, it was really cloudy, and the silk and electric light jumped inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the dead world! Where is the storm? Where is the dark cloud lightning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
