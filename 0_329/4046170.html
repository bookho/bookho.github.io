			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison? Brown calmed down and felt funny looking at the neighborhood. Due to the opening of the Sogwa Wax Museum, there are many people on the stone bridge. The carriage dragging heavy steel is slowly moving forward, so he laughed at himself: "It turned out that today is a lot of people, and there is a car and steel, so that this stone bridge built for nearly a hundred years is shaking. Oh, I am so too It’s too sensitive, like a bird that has been hit by a bow and arrow. As soon as you hear the sound of the bowstring, you will react fiercely even if you don’t shoot at yourself.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the reason, his emotions completely recovered, when the adventurer on his right hand moved closer and pretended to sneak in with his appearance: "Just an accident, you continue to the Soge Wax Museum ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. Oh, the City Hall has to send someone to reinforce the stone bridge." Brown did not refuse, walk to the small island opposite the stone bridge. Going there, there is an art district with oil painting halls, wax museums, opera houses, concert halls, etc. Buildings, as well as several upscale restaurants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman disguised as an adventurer looks at the right side, inadvertently facing Brown on the left hand side: "But it can't be careless, I have passed the magic The means let the church send people to check to see if the stone bridge is indeed in disrepair and meet the weight exceeding the limit, or someone has destroyed it with hidden magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although no magic fluctuations have been found, the night watchman is still cautious, worried about what is the little hidden magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the "professor's hand of resonance" only caused resonance, and the internal structure of the stone bridge was damaged because of its own vibration, and the post-mortem inspection I can't find traces of magic. Unless the City Hall or the church conducts a stone bridge safety assessment every two or two years, and then finds that the damage is so sudden and rapid through the comparison of the records before and after, the difference can be found. In this world of magic and magic, similar safety assessments have not yet appeared, basically based on the appearance of damage and public reflections will be reinforced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your vigilance really impressed me." Brown was very pleased with the guard and caution of the night watchman, because it meant he would be safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After crossing the stone bridge, after seven or eight minutes, Brown and his entourage went to the front of the Saugu Wax Museum, and the whole building was divided into two floors. Black smooth rock is built, retro style and atmospheric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Viscount Wright, hello, Baroque Captain..." In the hall of the Wax Museum, Viscount Wright and others have arrived, and Brown hurried forward to say hello . Even if he wants to move to the holy city of Lance in the future, he dreams of establishing good relations with these great aristocrats and wealthy people. They control the trade rights of the east and west coasts, the north and south continents, and they can live a luxury when they sneak out. beautiful life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Wright is a middle-aged man with a rare seaweed-like green hair, and he nodded in response to Brown: "Welcome our heroic knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most respected knight." Brown humbly said that his knight who relied on medicine to stimulate his blood was quite different from the real knight in will and spirit. And the Viscount Wright is a genuine four-level knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viscount Wright did not say much, turned his head and talked with his partner Granny to discuss business. Brown finds a few aristocrats and businessmen who are familiar with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, time is ten o'clock, the lines of the mouth are as hard as the stone. Soge stands with the nobles at the door, and announces the opening of the wax museum to other guests outside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ribbon-cutting in this world, only the band is accompanied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the crowd is moving, and in the distance is something strange, and the vigils who are mixed in the guests glance at each other, expressions It became very dignified, and then separated and rushed there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high black hat and the left eye monocle of Lucien changed their dress and stood in the crowd, seeing the pair of vigils posing as lovers When the person left, the night watchman who saw the gorgeous businessman looked quietly and sneaked away, leaving only the night watchman dressed by the adventurer and the boatman who was swimming around the canal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the "ferry" promise can help lead the night watchman, Lucien will not be stupid enough to take risks, at a lower level of strength, single People do things far less than organized actions. Why do you have to work hard and take great risks to lead them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for the opening was made after the earthquake of the stone arch bridge last night, because Lucien understood that his temptations could only have a temporary effect. When the night watchman changed his attire or carried out a small team handover, he must test again. Know which are the night watchers. Continuous temptations, even without magical fluctuations, still make people very suspicious, so they must seize the opportunity to act after the temptation until Brown returns home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien’s appearance is only slightly changed by hats, glasses and cosmetics. After all, it’s easy to be seen by the big knights with cover-ups, as long as Guaranteed not to be recognized by Brown at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown standing on the steps is a little wary of the instigation in the distance, whispering to become the adventurer of his entourage, like a night watchman: "No "Question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have a few night watchmen who have already rushed over, but you don't have to worry about your safety. There are three or four great knights, more than ten The Cavaliers are, how do the people in the Magic Council dare to do it?" The adventurer night watcher calmly answered. The bloody aristocrats inside and outside the Soge Wax Museum gathered, even if they were contaminated with the smell of money, they could not cover their own strength, so they were relieved to let the night watchers leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown looked at Viscount Wright and others and looked relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the blue light flashed in the distant bell tower, and a long arrow with a sharp blue arrow quickly shot at Brown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the speed, momentum, or danger of the long arrow indicates that the bell tower is at least a knight-level archer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long arrow passed through the canal and passed through the crowd, as if in a blink of an eye, he shot in front of Brown and did not give him a chance to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Wright left his hand and waved, and countless squalls slammed the long arrow, making it slower, but unable to stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turned out to be the archer of the great knight level! Or hold a three-level enchanted longbow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Viscount of Wright gave Brown time, a piece of white angel feathers reappeared, wrapped him inside, and the night watchman around him grabbed the shield. Vertically in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue long arrow hits the "Hunter's Shield", and he pierces through a hole in the silent, penetrating the past, shooting at "Angel Feather" above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of angel feathers turned into a splash of water, and there was a piece of snow white regeneration, and soon the arrow fell to the ground, Brown resisted this "pretly planned" long-range raid ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no movement on the clock tower. The boatman on the canal rushed to the clock tower under the direction of the adventurer night watchman. Although he was not strong, he was good at concealment. Tracking, as long as the archer is locked, he can summon other night watchmen to besiege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Wright snorted, and some people dared to assassinate themselves in front of them, so they told the followers to follow the night watchman to catch the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road in the crowd is very accustomed to push the monocle: "There is one more night watchman and many knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this raid, Brown’s alertness should be reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In Shiqiao, the distance is too far to see clearly. This time, it can be clearly seen that the magical charm of Brown's chest is dim light, and there should be only one 'Angel Feather' or other magical skills."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Organized resources and staffing are really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lucien’s “leading” It is required that no matter how the stewards of the Stuart Magic Council are completed, they must be divided into two waves, and the second wave must have a long-range attack that threatens Brown enough. Of course, it is only a threat, and must leave immediately after the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown Cry undecided to the side watchman: "The Demon Hunter Shield is destroyed and needs to be repaired. 'Angel's Feather' is only one time left. Let's go back now?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
