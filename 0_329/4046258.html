			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we were relaxed at that time, the monsters saw a rare opportunity, so I wanted to try to dominate Sandra. As long as it succeeds, we can make us die unclear." White. And at the time, Mr. Evans was trying to contact the outside world. Once you found out that you couldn’t talk to Mr. Gaston, you could quickly detect that it didn’t die completely.” Charlotte said his opinion, “In addition, according to Bill. The description of this monster is related to greed, hatred, jealousy and other emotions. They often cannot control their own intellect, and will not weigh the risk of adventurous attacks and hidden waiting opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slow infiltration of the follow-up effect of the "Song of Water", Lucien's spirit and body are much better, although there is no way to cast and run, but with the help of Charlotte's power Going very smoothly: "If it's just this thing, Charlotte's explanation is completely okay, even the truth of the matter, but don't you think there are still many doubts?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls who walked in front of them heard the words of Lucian, and Sandra looked around incessantly, and kept thinking about the previous picture in her mind. Susan was crying and trembled and said: "Mr. Evans, you, don't scare me, isn't that monster still dead? You all do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this time A little bit of wind and grass, you can scare the nightmare-like Susan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, the behavior pattern of the monster has some contradictory points that we cannot understand." Charlotte affirmed the problem of Lucien. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan, who heard his words, had a soft knee and almost couldn’t hold his body, and finally managed to stand firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlotte paused and continued: "It can be seen from many travel notes and notes that the demon of the abyss and some of the nightmare monsters themselves are chaotic. If they do not contradict themselves, they will be surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, Mr. Charlotte, you, you just scared me." Shan couldn't help but complain, Charlotte said that half of the time actually stopped, letting himself think that the monster would appear, and almost scared himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was not angry with Charlotte’s rebuttal because of his suspicion, and gently recognized his head: “The demon species in the abyss is many times that of hell. Especially in the boneless wasteland, new undead races are created every day, and we don’t know it is normal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan has a long sigh of relief, even Evan Mr. Si has given up doubts, the monster is really dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can turn to the front of the road: "But the devil is chaotic again, and it is impossible to let go of the chance to kill us, according to his strength in the bondage. When the apprentice hall first attacked, he had enough ability to kill me directly. Whether it was malformation or shadow well, I have no corresponding magical means to prevent it. As a result, it used direct attack on the soul and spirit. The four-ring magic 'evil gaze' and the five-ring magic 'cardiac arrest' means that under the protection of the anti-death enchantment, the latter can not directly kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Lucien began to review, he is currently only specialized in elements and astrology, not enough magic research on other factions, in the face of soul, spirit, curse and strange change attacks, There is not enough magic means to defend. After going back, you have to choose two factions to study. At the same time, you need to learn the basic magic of other factions, so as to avoid the lack of means and the weak enemy to kill by the strange magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe when attacking through a mirror, it can't use malicious deformation, etc., it can only attack against the spirit and soul. For example, it is also trying to dominate me." "Sandra has his own understanding of this, and it is very realistic. When using other extraordinary powers, the monster is not in the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "It seems that the discussion helps to solve the doubts. Thank you for answering my question, but there are still two last questions. Why is the restraint room arranged like this? Mr. Bertrand should not use the restraint to hold the ridiculous summoning ceremony, and Bill could not qualify to borrow the exclusive bond of Mr. Bertrand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, why is the parchment of that special summoning ceremony just seen by us? Since Bill dominates the castle and has awesome power from monsters, why do you think of burning books? Well, just when he wants to conceal the parliament and want to continue to use the magic apprenticeship, but do you think that such a monster will only burn more than half of the burning, and found that a small part has fallen under the desk?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for just being seen by us, it can only be said that it is a coincidence." Sandra took Susan into the corridor with energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took his pocket watch out of his pocket and looked at it: "Then I have no doubt, it is now 5:25, about 40. The high-level magician who handles the follow-up will come, let us wait patiently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Mr. Evans." Charlotte, Sandra And Susan answered at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every question of Lucian is explained, a series of questions still make Sandra and Susan stunned, so Charlotte is very Be wary, so they didn't disarm, the colored energy ball was still circling over Sander and Susan's head, and the spell absorbing wall would protect Lucien and Charlotte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this corridor, I walked a distance, and there was a house with a large door open. Susan looked down and then gently licked it. One sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and others followed her gaze and saw that the room was empty and nothing, so Sandra asked strangely: "Su Shan, what room is this? Is there any problem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan wrinkled a red-hot eyebrow with a doubt: “This is Mr. Bertrand’s vault. There are gold, silver and precious magic materials in his savings, but now there is nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do monsters like these things?" The feeling of guilt that is easy to fade down hits the senses of the people again. These things disappear too strangely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra licked his teeth: "Maybe the monster that is summoned wants to maintain it, you need precious gold, gems and magic materials." That being said, she watched the surrounding vigilantly, and I couldn’t imagine the destruction and destruction of all the media. The monsters could be resurrected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to pay like a summoning dragon?" Charlotte was a little ridiculous. "We don't want to go any further. Just arrange magical array here. There are still many mysteries in the matter. But I think it is another reason, it has nothing to do with the monster, it is definitely impossible to resurrect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan soft feet soft The ground began to cooperate with Charlotte and Sandra to arrange a defensive magical array. Lucien did not have much strength to lean against the wall, using mental power to painfully with the soul and the head, only to force the magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the magic array was completed, Charlotte, Sandra, and Susan often sighed, no matter what enemy, as long as they did not exceed The five rings, it takes at least ten minutes to break the magic array defense, and there are two four-ring magicians inside, so it is more than enough to insist on the arrival of high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Charlotte and Sandra stood on both sides of the gate, Susan was in a corner position, and Lucien leaned against the side wall. Opposite is a smooth pattern of rock, which reflects the more blurred figure, but can see the sandra's cracked neckline, Charlotte's broken small vest, Lucien's monocle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After quietly watching their hard Lucian, the whole thing has been repeated in my mind, seriously: "Maybe the monster is indeed dead, But from the beginning it seems that someone is hiding everything behind the scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien said the judgment, his shadow wearing a monocle suddenly grinned. It’s no longer strange, but proud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did it come in? ! Lu Xien ignored the headache, and the subconscious ignited the blasphemy, and a holy light blew past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, what's wrong?" Charlotte and Sandra turned around alertly, but only on the wall was "Bright Light" by Lucien The magical array of light that ignites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien examines himself carefully and finds that he has not been attacked by any undercover, nor has he been attacked by soul and spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it too nervous for me, plus the more chaotic use of the elemental vortex, so I have an illusion?" Lucien felt that she was overreacting. But I still described the scene I just saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is the monster, how could it not take the opportunity to attack Mr. Evans? And if it does not attack, why should it expose itself, there is no benefit! "Sandra and Charlotte obviously think that Lucien has an illusion under the weakness...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
