			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominates the signal, centering on the super-large transmission array, bursting into a black storm like the end of the world, the shining cathedral is God The pillars and domes that have been reinforced are all boasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building on the left melts like glass, and the ice on the right freezes into a glimpse of ice crystals, both of which are crystal clear and colorful, then, hot and cold Change, they become powder and gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, in the storm, another giant snake-like silver lightning slammed into the super-large transmission array, and every lightning seemed to have taken up. The horrible destruction of the atmosphere, the powerful electromagnetic force twists the surrounding scene, the huge wind, thunder, as if the road is a roar of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fundamental magical "Furious Storm" of Fernando's legendary career! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the "God's Guardian" of the King of Angels, with the projection of Heavenly Mountain, seems to have placed himself and the super-large transmission array in another The world, that is the ideal place for the Holy Spirit and angels to arrive, is the sanctuary for the God of Truth to redeem the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devastating storm, lightning, high temperature, low cold, acting on the "Guardian of God" directly penetrated the past as if they did not interfere with each other. The ripples that do not belong to this world, the faint color is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is "the guardian of God", it really is the "king of angels", the highest angel who has come, the existence of the legendary peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time he seems to be coming straight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those radicals are confessed by the mysterious man known as the "Great Prophet" and "The Incarnation of the Angel King", the Magic Council and Lucien have always considered it to be Sal De is in the midst of embarrassment, so it is mainly to guard against him, but did not expect to be the real king of angels, the existence of the title of "the god of the small truth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the big man behind Thrall is him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is their relationship with the Pope and other Cardinal members? Is it a cooperative set of traps, or is it intentionally pitted on both sides to benefit from it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando continues to use the legendary magic while thinking about the electric turn, thinking about the purpose of Mekantron and Sarde, with the preparation to replace the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Glorious Cathedral without the enchantment of the enchantment becomes a ruin under the "Furious Storm", Donald, the master of the pedigree, the high-level magician Some of the clerics who attached to the parliament quickly withdrew. This is a legendary battlefield. They simply cannot get into the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change has turned their repressed fears into tension and anxiety. At this time, a calm and steady voice came from midair: "Withdraw from Allinge The rest of the people attacked with me. Although the guardian of God belongs to the extreme of space-like defensive spells, it claims to be free from all damages, but it also has the upper limit it bears. It is not difficult for us to break together!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who stood up for hundreds of years and supported the Magic Council came. The familiar and awkward voice eased the tension and anxiety in the hearts of the magicians such as Soups, and believed that things were still under control. The Speaker of the House of Representatives will not fall, and the Parliament will not suffer from the destruction of the surname! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, Douglas floats on one side, as if the light is shining in the hand, it seems that a vast sun is about to be born, and in other winds, the legendary magicians are separated. Stand up in case you are killed by God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elemental Dominator", "Hand of Destruction", "Witch of Ice", "Prophet", "Eye of Curse", "Light of Starry "The Sun King" and "Alchemy Master"... I watched the eleven legends of the Magic Council gather here, and there are five great arcans, a legendary peak, Donald and others who are more calm and fly into the lock. Opened Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ariel also surrounded one after another, "Stars", which has one of the best locks in the sky, the key moment can be one The powerhouse is close to the legendary third-order powerhouse, but the energy is not enough to support it for too long, unless the "eternal furnace" envisioned by Lucian, the magnetically constrained nuclear fusion reactor, can become a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard and sharp Arthur stood in front of the radical cardinals, bishops, and pastors, and fanatically and devoutly said: "It is time for us to marry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "On the truth forever!" These cardinals, the bishops all kneel before the cross, began to whisper prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Arthur turned and crossed his arms, placed on the chest like a cross, slammed into the ground, and said in his mouth:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one and 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the beginning, but also the end."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the creator and the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...will make your way to the ground as if walking on you Country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Cardinals follow the mourning:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...will make Your way is on the ground, as if you are walking in your country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy light is gently radiated from their bodies, and they are dyed in clear colors. There seems to be a single wing on the back. This holy light is connected together and quickly expands into the sea, rushing toward the east side of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knight Shidong saw this scene in the Grail Knights station, surprised and confusingly confusing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"The Heavenly Kingdom of the Earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the enchantment of God, which is second only to God's Fall, and is called the guardian of God. The area has been transformed into a "land of heaven", but the cost of use is extremely horrible. At least 20 or more cardinals and equivalent angels, hundreds of bishops, thousands of pastors must be martyrdom, and there must be a god of blazing angels. The host is presided over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Rantat Monastery, the Holy Light Ocean flows rapidly toward the aristocratic area of ​​the east, and then the radical clerics gather in the city of Rentart. The Holy Light is also shining in the church, one node and one node. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of Ariel in heaven, you will find that there are numerous light spots in the west of Rantart, as if the Holy Spirit and the pastor are praising, and the more To the east, such light spots are getting less and less, but they are getting brighter and brighter. Even if they are divided by the naked eye, they can be seen to be divided into six layers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathering of the light, resonating with the whole gods of Renttat, the light is more and more dazzling, and finally the "king of angels" with the guardianship of God "Connected together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...will definitely make you The road is on the ground, as if walking in your country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethereal prayers sounded throughout the Rentham, the distortion of the Holy Light, the soup in the sky Others suddenly saw that from the west to the east, the first and second layers of the Heavenly Mountain appeared in turn, until the projection of the seventh floor, like the land of heaven! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, Fernando, etc. only feel that they are trapped in the ocean of light, the mental power is a bit slow, and seems to be isolated from the real world, breaking the "land of heaven" "Before, all the damage can't be reflected in the city of Rentat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "the heavens on earth" has only a certain degree of weakening effect on the strong players in the legendary field. The higher the level, the less affected, the Douglas quickly adjusted. Come over and prepare to cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the super-large transmission array is bright and bright, and there are thirteen figures in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mermos, Anasta, Maria, Augusta, Anthony, Valenhill, Azallo, Asti La, Baha'u'llah..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five saints, the eight Holy Spirit priests or the holy knights, plus the king of angels, the quantity and strength in a flash More than the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando sighed softly and took back the idea of ​​starting the plan four, only 13 members of the cardinal group, indicating that the pope was also caught off guard, in a hurry There is no way to mobilize more power, which also shows that there is a deep gap between Thrad and the King of Angels and the Pope, and even their plots count the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
