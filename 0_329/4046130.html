			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second floor of the pub, Sarah and Lilith tried to calm themselves down and patience, and the sound of the following sighs had completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, those adventurers with muscles in their heads also understand the important surnames that maintain physical strength and spirit." Lilith sneered with a smile. Sarah shook his head and prepared to remind his sister not to underestimate the adventurers who were able to move around the edge of the Melzer Black Forest and the Dark Mountains all year round. There is no death, there must be a certain strength. Among them, there may be a knight-level powerhouse. But when he just opened his mouth, he saw the candle in front of him slowly and pale, and the surrounding walls were like peeling off the color. A little bit of darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a layer of faint gray ash slowly emerges in a deserted, gloomy, silent, in this boring black and white world, Sarah and Lilith are only similar. I feel that even the room next to them and the first floor of the pub below have many adventurers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden table touched by the palm is gradually becoming black, as if it also reveals a rotten taste. This surprised Sarah and couldn't think too much. She pulled up her sister's hand and ran outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going fast, really weird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before fear and fear suppressed by greed And the emotions and other emotions all floated up, and Sarah hurriedly told Lilith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his voice is also like a gray smog and a monotonous black and white, which becomes ethereal and fuzzy, even if Lilith is only around him. Looking at him confusedly, he followed him downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah himself also found the power of the power, let go of the throat, shouted loudly: "Run! There is danger here!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith finally heard the voice that my brother seemed to be coming from another world, and ran and nodded. She is much more timid than her brother. After seeing such a change in the town, she can’t wait to leave immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two magic apprentices did not forget their magic, holding the casting material in their hands, swearing at the mouth, and releasing them as soon as they were in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running down the stairs, Sarah saw that the adventurers found out that they were wrong, and they were rushing to the pub door, so they took the sister to the adventurer. I didn’t expect the back door to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the wooden door with one foot, the two brothers and sisters rushed out, because none of the sleeping townspeople found an abnormality, so the gray street was unusually quiet. The darkness slowly peeled off and shattered around the center of Lake Elsinore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara and Lilith did not return to the direction of "Massava Town", full of fear of the gray and cold silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the two arrived at the town, in front of the boulevard leading to the town of Masawa and several adventurers who ran here faster than them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to Lake Elsinore? What's wrong with the lock?" Sarah and Lilith, who were slightly relieved, have seen countless Question, ready to look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first adventurers who arrived first and they were the same mind, have turned their heads to the direction of Lake Elsinore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Lilith had not had time to look back, and her beautiful big eyes came out and screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skins of those adventurers who were exposed were violently defeated, and in a few places they began to rot, and their expressions were awkward, and they did not seem to find their bodies at all. The change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar saw several adventurers look empty, slammed a sister and shouted: "Don't look back! Keep running!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two brothers and sisters scared their throats with a sour taste, and there was a burst of horror, crying and "laughing" sounds in the town of Bonn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the feeling of thick curtains appeared, the two brothers and sisters seemed to be warmer, but they did not dare to stay, resisting dizziness and continuing to Massa Wa town escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What changes have happened to the locks?! This is completely different from the revelation given to us by the great Silver Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short surprise, Ilya made a decisive decision. Through the crystal ball, tell the priests, priests, and dark knights: "Don't take care of those who prepare blood sacrifices to unlock the seal. The change of the lock means that the person is about to break free! We must immediately start the summoning array and let the true God come directly!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town of Bonn and Lake Elsinore fly six priests, and the ground stands with twelve priests and dark knights. This is the silver horn. All of the strengths of the entire Vaurit Principality, including those from other countries and the dark mountains who followed the silver gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia flew over Lake Elsinore and saw the sparkling, quiet and beautiful lake water suddenly disintegrating after being completely solidified, turning into pieces The illusory ray reflects the star-shaped cross and the squirming red liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around the strange Lake Elsinore, there are many "ghosts" with gimmicks and pale tails, clear but floating "wores" , always dark and sly shadows, and a variety of other ghost-like undead creatures, all of them look up and scream, the invisible waves are superimposed together to form an illusory and huge monster, wearing a black robe, holding a long The sickle, his feet stepped on the red liquid, and his dry face had a pair of pale, empty eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this illusory monster, even if I had prepared and gave myself a lot of magical protection, Ilia couldn’t help but shudder, as if life Power is passing fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the big cross star frame slowly disintegrating, the black and white gray world and the main world overlap here, the dreamy starlight, Ilya quickly recovered calm, I don't know where to take out a huge pale palm, each of which bends to reveal a sharp, human-like spur, sparkling with a cold, icy light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the palm of the hand, Ilya chanted a mantra that was irritating and mad, a silver-white line from the priests in the air, the gods on the ground, and The Dark Knights gathered around Ilya to form a complex array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mantra is finished, and the silent world of black and white is a layer of creeping silver, cold and evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia quickly threw the pale palm into the center of the sorcerer's squad, and the silver white rolled down and wrapped it and pulled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver-white door with countless strange, evil runes is slowly appearing, and the big cross-shaped star frame below is almost completely gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a horrible, illuminating monotonous black-and-white gray glow beam hit from the sky, right in the middle of the silver door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black disappears, gray disappears, and the whole world is filled with only endless light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe monster over Elsinore Lake is directly vaporized, and all sorts of ghosts and undead creatures disappeared in silence. The undead creatures produced in the small town of Bonn are also smouldering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-ring god of yang is bursting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amorton, Gossett! Are you not going to the border and guarding Aalto?" Ilya was surprised to see two red dresses appearing at high altitude. The figure of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amoton with long black hair and beautiful wood is holding a cross with a shining cross of the sun. The short-haired Cosette is as serious as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still beautiful Hart? Count Lafayette, deputy head of the Violet Knights, the 9th-level gold knight, Earl of Hayward, and two other knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the strongholds stationed in the North Fortress and the fortress near the Dark Mountains, nearly half of the strong people of the Vaurit duchy have gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the sky and on the ground behind them, the captains "El Salvador", clowns and other night watchmen also approached and blocked the cultists to escape. the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vera? Amorton, the seven-ring cardinal, put up the eight-level magical badge and replied coldly: "We will completely eliminate the silver-white horn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
