			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien almost forgot the dwarf thing, was recalled by Natasha, stopped to eat caviar, hehe laughed "I haven't told you about the adventures of the night plateau in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you are too bad, the defensive core of the vampire count Adding an extra layer of defense to make it more 'sturdy'!" Even now, Natasha said that she couldn't help but smile. Lucien is always full of the so-called bad taste in his own mouth. However, I like it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was quite proud of the response at the time: "That time, in order to abduct the dwarves back, I will mistakenly pretend to be their steam god, but also deliberately 'Showing' an illusory kingdom of God - 'Atlantis', inside is my fantasy scene of the continued development of the alchemy industry, the future I want to see, hey, I still imagined passing Great advances in the field of elements and alchemy have created an alchemy bomb that rises like the sun, and later, you know that reality is more bizarre than fantasy, and 'eternal blaze' already has it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since speaking of the dwarf, Lucien explained a little bit for "Atlantis" in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the description of Lucien, Natasha first groaned and then laughed and could not keep the court etiquette. I almost crouched on the table: "I said what the dwarves are worshipping. It turned out to be an alchemy bomb. Haha, it's so interesting! I have never seen such an interesting sect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;By the bombs, I used to watch the game and I saw it. Lucien smiled and watched Natasha smile and lean forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha tried to control herself and said with a smile: "According to the intelligence department’s report, after the explosion of 'Eternal Chiyang' in the previous period, the group of dwarves It’s like madness, devoutly worshipping silver-gray, haha, silver-gray steel bombs, screaming at the gods, Atlantis’s advent, and so on, and constantly inquiring about the “eternal blaze” Who is the god of steam gods...the voters...the saints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they know that it is the magic I created, my steam The god will be reduced to a voter." Lucien shakes her head and feels guilty. When the dwarf grows up like this, the doctrine is perfected, the religious rituals are perfected, and the power of faith will gather on oneself. ? Or do you want to go directly to the "nuclear bomb"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no desire for "God" for the time being, and El is the forerunner of the past, but the gathering of the power of studying belief is his long-standing idea. Opening the veil of the gods will reveal the deep mysteries of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing the naturalization of the dwarf, Natasha took the napkin and wiped her mouth: "I will distribute the excess monastery to the city halls everywhere." , as the address of the general school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evacuation of the Southern Church, the number of moderate sects was much worse than the time of the heyday, and in order to control them, Nata Shah took part of the monastery and the church field to the royal family and the country, and filled the treasure house of the queen and the treasure house of the kingdom, so she could not carelessly agree to the plan of Lucien's general school - she used the private part. No need to vote in the House of Lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you and the parliament jointly run a school to train a batch of talents, I think the foundation of the royal family will be more stable." Lucien said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha put down the napkin and smiled at Lucien: "Your plan, of course I will support you, and you have convinced me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently, with a serious and serious expression: "If there is no change around, or if it remains in a state of ignorance, then success in such a society What is the meaning of being a leader of a group of pigs? The real arcane masters must promote the progress of society and make human beings more civilized, so that everyone can enjoy the convenience brought by alchemy items. And comfort, this is the greatest achievement..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Lucien’s straightforward words, Natasha looked at him quietly, her eyes focused. This kind of him is more attractive than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lu Xi’an finished, Natasha smiled brightly: “Well, in a country that is poor and backward, many people don’t even have basic knowledge.” How can I see that my country is flourishing and the level of civilization is improved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha first licked, the mouth was pumping, and then she understood that Lucien had something else to say, so she picked up the black knight cap next to it and slanted it on her head. The pace was not fast. Not slowly follow Lucien into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien opened the Reading Magic Array, she drankly: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is no major event for a while, you were not angry, I didn't tell you about the promotion legend?" Lucien looked at Natasha with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to think of something, can't help but blush, very beautiful, then coughed twice, thoughts turned: "You intend to conceal has been promoted Legendary facts? In order to combat the church may be sent to obliterate your legendary powerhouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien erected a thumbs up, in this respect, Natasha I have always been very keen: "Yes, to weaken the legendary strength of the church as much as possible. If I publish this matter, they will probably not take any action, but use another method of killing. After all, a legendary magician is It’s hard to kill, it’s not going to hit them, and you’re still covered by the shadow of Ketonia, I want to combine these two things.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that a large part of Lucien’s doing this is to help him deal with Ketonia. Natasha originally wanted to oppose it, but after seeing Lucien’s firm eyes, he gave up the original idea. The corner of the mouth evoked, slightly smiling: "The problem is that only how to plan to assassinate People, how have you been prepared to be assassinated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, we are looking for opportunities to fish them out together." Lucien did not hesitate. As long as the other party miscalculates their own strength, they can drag them to wait until the Speaker of the House, the teacher, Hathaway, and other reinforcements are quickly surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha held her right elbow in her left hand and rubbed her chin in her right hand: "Ketonia and the possible assassinations of the church should not be so easy to be fooled. They are experienced. If we do something a little wrong, we will be discovered and used in reverse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we can't deliberately go out and sway, we have a very Justified, not suspicion." Lucien frowned slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also thought about the "opportunity" of the creation. Suddenly, her eyes lit up and she patted her hand: "Wedding, our wedding! Although there are guests such as Hathaway, the storm, and the Lord, the scene will be relatively chaotic and will give the assassin a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship between us Everyone knows that it is normal and normal to hold a wedding after the situation is stable. No one will doubt it." Lucian nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha added: "And it can go a step further. For example, you are a big arcian, I am a queen, the wedding must be equal, or Nexus One palace, Allinge, or you go to Nexus Palace to pick me up and my father, Holm royal family members, etc., to Aringe, so that only the protection of Hathaway mother-in-law on the way, leaving the assassination Space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the church is shot, it is probably the flame of the source, or the giants remaining in the referee. I analyzed their previous action records and found that they are daring. The only question is whether Ketonia is with them. If not, how can they ensure that there are redundant people entangled in Hathaway's mother-in-law? We have to make two different plans for this." Lucien is fast. Answering, the two of you said a word about me and discussed the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Natasha said: "When can you inscribe the remaining two legendary magic in the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fastest half a year, the latest seven or eight months." Lucien said his time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha gently daggers and smiles: "That will be held on the first day of the next tenth of April next year, I will first disclose this news. Going out, is time enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough." Lucien thinks he has time to refine his exclusive legendary items. The problem is that he is not suitable for the legendary field. Precious materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to have guessed the mind of Lucien, and laughed and said: "The wedding is fixed, you really become my fiancé, the treasure house of the royal family will You are open, hope to have the legendary grade material that suits you. If not, then take it and exchange it with other legendary magicians, such as Hathaway and the storm to dominate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
