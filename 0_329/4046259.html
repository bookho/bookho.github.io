			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged magician looked around the hall and sighed with sympathy to the dragon: "Bertran is really a bad luck, and it was normally prepared in the bondage." Summon two devils to experiment, and the youngest apprentice happens to hold a special summoning ceremony in the secret room. Otherwise, with his castle set up for many years, it is not difficult to find the strangeness in advance and remove the monsters that have not yet grown up."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tang spectrum, I don't think it is just right." The dragon dragged out a bulging bag hidden under his body and counted his eyes brightly. Inside, a piece of brilliant gold that has just been refined, one by one, a good yellow gold coin, a magical material of various colors but very beautiful, and then answered with carelessly, "According to my experience, when the child tried When seeking power through Pain Fable, this abominable monster has already formed a projection in his heart, affecting his emotions, judgments, and methods of doing things. Later special rituals are merely strengthening this. Shadow and let it draw strength forming "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; it sounds immature, like children, men and women can not tell, and obviously reach high-end strength is very contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged magician called the soup spectrum smiles and looks at the dragon and counts his treasure on the ground, and asks a little curiously: "Affris, you Experience?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, every time I see the treasure of the sparkling, my heart always has a monster called 'greedy' projected, affecting My emotions and thoughts. So, Tomp, it is not my fault to rob the vault, and I can't control myself." The dragon Affris answered innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup spectrum is funny: "Where did the monster project from? Affris, can you control your emotions and thoughts now? Can you return?" Treasure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already able to control, but you have already promised this as my reward, how can you recover it? You are the most creditworthy and The recipe of the contract!” Affris resolutely swears. “As for where the monster is projected, I don’t know, it may be related to ancient hell...” It whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soup spectrum is thoughtfully: "Several Arcane masters have explored hell, dealing with some of the Duke of Hell, the Earl, plus Some of the relics and records that have been handed down from ancient times, they found a lot of things, such as rumors that there are seven unusually powerful, horrible and mysterious devils in the deepest part of hell, representing arrogance, greed, jealousy, hatred, pain, indulgence And hypocrisy, these seven negative descriptions, but unfortunately they have never been confirmed to exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And according to another interpretation, they are just evil from hell The seven abstract symbols extracted from the devils, each of which has at least one of its qualities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? It turned out to be..." Affris replied perfunctorily, and carefully transferred some small and precious items from the bag to himself. After all, some of them belonged to the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup pretends to continue to say without seeing it: "With regard to the Allegory of Pain, it is necessary to include this special summoning ceremony in the scope of the key research of the Parliament. It may be related to a certain secret of the world. The appearance, existence and rapid and powerful changes of the monster are too strange and mysterious. If it weren't for Aphrodite, you are naturally good at the spirit, soul, and mind. I am afraid I am It will let it escape..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even a high-level magician like him feels that the monster is very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took the badge out of his arms and put it on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............in the vault, because Lucien suddenly attacked the wall, let Charlotte, Sandra and others follow the nervous, suspicious, especially Susan I don’t even dare to breathe too much. I seem to be afraid that the monster that can be thrown anywhere can slam from behind or in other unexpected corners! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, the tense and tense atmosphere reached the apex with the clear echoes in the hallway, then a middle-aged man dressed in a flame-like magic robe Appeared outside the vault, his dark blue eyes, wearing a pair of Sven's gold silk eyes, looks handsome and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I am the soup of the Commission, just in Casper County, so I took over the matter." Middle-aged man through the magic array The defensive wall looked at the abnormal alert, and Lu Xien and others who seemed to be attacking magic at any time, smiled and amiable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien waved to stop Susan, who was surprised to get out. She said cautiously: "Mr. Tang, in order to ensure safety, please let us check your badge, because the monster is very strange and terrifying."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although facing the top of the Magic Council of the Commission, Charlotte and Sandra nodded to recognize Lucien’s decision, and the monster scammed after the deformation The case of the magician is not two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum smiled and took the three badges down, floating on the side of the vault door, let Lu Xien and others check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirmation, Charlotte opened the defensive magic array and reported very directly: "Mr. Tang, this time the monster is very strange, there are many things. Mystery, I will talk about it from beginning to end, so that you can take over the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the status of the three in the team, this kind of thing should have come to Lucien Do, but he is very weak now, and speaking is not a problem, but it is very difficult, so he gave it to Charlotte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be serious about listening to Charlotte’s story, and the soup nodded: “The level of this mandatory task exceeded the original estimate, and it was changed from a simple task. Dangerous missions, so the final reward for the Arcane points will be greatly improved after the assessment. Moreover, the magic items destroyed in the mission, the magic medicines consumed, and the parliament will be compensated as soon as possible after the confirmation. You will submit the list to the mission area for waiting. It will be a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I am relieved." Sandra, who has short hair, patted her neckline, and looked very happy, obviously that The value of the talisman is very important, and it is her important means of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte is not happy, but the cold expression is softer, and his magic robe is also a powerful item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup spectrum blocked the castle with magic, and first escorted the weak Lucian and others back to the town of Ferrez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Going to the carriage of the capital of Karpas County, after a long silence, Sandra’s tone is complicated: "This mission has all sorts of secrets." The only certainty is that the ridiculous summoning ritual has caused a magician apprentice to summon an horrible monster. This is really unexplained by the current summoning arcane knowledge, which makes me aware of this. Confusion, maybe the process is not what I imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people, Sandra is the only one who is good at summoning magic, so the impact is the biggest . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Summon Magic is a faction that clearly retains the ancient magical empire style and remains on the surface in arcane research, but Bill’s special summoning ritual is even ancient. The summoning common sense of the magic empire is seriously violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If even the apprentice can summon a monster with at least five rings of strength, what are the other faction's magicians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sandra is really difficult to understand, it is estimated that the ancient summoners will also use it as a joke made by some bards who do not understand magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte nodded lightly: "We need to see the complete process of the special summoning ceremony to judge, but it is really a very strange thing, until now I still have the feeling of darkness and darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always think that the monster is Bill himself..." Susan interjected. In fact, she has a little bit of movement. If it is not obvious that Bill can't control himself, and the appearance is ugly, no one will refuse this kind of ritual that will raise the strength to the five rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recovered a lot, looking at Susan and Scott through a monocle: "Have you read "Fable Allegory"?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan shook his head, and Scott looked terrified: "Mr. Evans, I am familiar with Bill, I have read a few times in his room. The stories are very dark, and the plot seems to be covered with a hopeless gray forever. After reading, either despair or frustration, and want to destroy this painful world. I don't understand why. It can be called a fable, maybe it can be used to scare children who are not willing to sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to go to the Arcane Library to borrow some information to see, just right I decided to learn more about the magic of the two factions." Lucien intends to go back and read the basics of the Nebula of the Force Field and the Necromancer, and the latter can also learn from the book of Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
