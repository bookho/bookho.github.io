			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cosmological constant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the popular sense, if there are multiple different universes, this is the intrinsic feature of the universe, its DNA, which determines that it is different from other The place of the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing through the world, Lucien found that although most of the natural laws and elements are consistent with the earth, there are obvious differences, such as The "disappearing" stars of destiny, such as the existence of magic, magic, blood power, such as the dragon, the devil, the vampire and the existence of many magical substances, so Lucien subconsciously believes that this universe is definitely not the universe where the earth is, no matter it Some natural laws are similar, and many elements are the same. In the basic place, the cosmological constants are definitely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the formula of thermal radiation causes such a large psychological fluctuation and emotional ups and downs of Lucien, on the one hand, the formulas deduced by Fernando and Douglas respectively mean this The world is also discontinuous and quantified. It is completely contradictory to the current general understanding of the Magic Council. Just like the ordinary elevator does not slowly climb, but suddenly jumps from the first floor to the second floor, jumping from the second floor to the third. The building, which does not go through the middle of the place, is totally unreasonable. On the other hand, it can derive a cosmological constant. On Earth, it is called the Planck constant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first point, although it will cause the subversion of the entire arcane system, but when the elements are found to have a periodic law, confirming that the atom has an internal structure, Lucian psychology If you are prepared, you will not be nervous and nervous. When you can derive the constant, you will be caught in a konjac and even have various auditory hallucinations, because as long as the constant comes out, it is compared with the Planck constant on the earth. The same universal gravitational constants before the above can basically judge the similarities and differences between the two universes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This doesn’t seem to matter, but for Lucien, it’s an important step in unlocking the tip of the world’s fog, and it’s a source of tension that can’t restrain the mood’s volatility. It is a deeper attempt to approach the essence of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are the same? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are the same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, all kinds of auditory hallucinations caused by the complex emotions of restless panic disappeared immediately, Lucian seemed to be caught in a semi-virtual and semi-real illusion, meditation The environment is violently shaken, and the surrounding environment consisting of fire and feng shui is broken, and the gravitational starlight that is illuminated is forcing the entire cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the surrounding environment "rebirth of the fire", slowly rebuilt a new space above the debris, the energy of the rogue is no longer like the continuous flow of water, but instead One copy, like the chopping light shining on the water, like a tiny star that can't be counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long, the cognitive environment has been completely stabilized, Lucian slowly opened his eyes, but fortunately, his subconsciously agree that energy is a share. The conclusion is that it is the end of the headshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “energy child” of the cognitive environment seems to be able to penetrate the virtual and wander around the soul and spiritual world. Lucien feels that his soul is unprecedentedly powerful and the spirit seems to It is possible to faintly touch the deep mysteries around us, as an important obstacle to the middle to high level as recorded in the book The Astrology and Elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive world initial essence, soul and spiritual power is strong enough to directly interfere with reality, the mastery of arcane and magic knowledge is enough to resolve an extremely complex six-ring magic, This is the three major obstacles from the middle to the high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such progress, Lucien of the four-ring magician did not have a slight joy, the agreement of the Planck constant, plus the previous gravitation Constants, even if you don't want to admit it, have to make a terrible inference: "There is a big possibility here is the universe in which the Earth is located. Of course, it does not rule out a similar universe with the same cosmological constant, but the emergence of magic and magic,' How to explain the disappearance of the stars?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain in the cylinder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Matrix? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A test area for a class of powerful creatures? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or another theory of human choice in the same universe? Consciousness determines the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a moment when Lucien has such a strong desire to explore the real world, and it is unprecedented for improving his magic level and arcane level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case today, you go back first, and continue to come over to read the letter tomorrow morning." Fernando did not open his eyes and gave a slightly exhausted command to take Lucien from Woke up in meditation, I found out that my hands are full of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have the physical control of the second-level knight, Lucien is already close to the cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, teacher." Lucien took a few deep breaths and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando was aware of Lucian’s anomaly at this time, thinking that he was also tortured by the two damn formulas, and he was relieved. "Although it is difficult to admit that you are an idiot, but all the Arcanists can't solve the problem, they often have to post a discussion in the "Arcane" "Magic" journal to get inspiration. Wait until the next issue of "Arcane" Issuance, if we have not solved the problem of heat radiation, we will sort out the two formulas and submit them in the name of me and you, Brooke and Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Teacher, I'm fine, just need a quiet rest." Lucien's spirit is a bit embarrassing, did not understand Fernando's kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the gates of the parliament’s headquarters, the fresh air blows, Lucien has the feeling of reviving, this is the real world, the beautiful world. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least no researchers have pulled the pipes, and they have not been erased by the matrix..." Lucien shook his head, humorously and happily ridiculed himself. "It is necessary to speed up the improvement of knowledge and strength... The formula and constant of heat radiation are used as the next paper, but it must be gradually and gradually let the archaeologists accept it, otherwise it will explode a few heads and let the magic parliament The strength of the decline has made the church once again occupy an absolute advantage, and things have become troublesome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Soul Library, most of the quantum books are Seal status, I don't know when to unlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...............After more than a week, June 28th, early morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien slowly spread the butter on the bread and used the aristocratic etiquette for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is the Evans teacher, the atomic institute is established?" Sprint underneath finally couldn't stand it and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent most of his time in the home of Lucien because he resigned from the work of a magical restaurant waiter. Every day except learning and practicing magic, it’s just Help Lu Xien to sort out some information - he concentrates on the analysis of the five-ring magic, and even the experiments are rarely done, so the proud Sprint always feels that he is a waste, and he can't help anything, for the Institute of Atomic Research. Things are getting more and more urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put down the milk cup, wiped his mouth with a napkin, and did not panic: "Quick, probably this time, because I last night The magic of 'Fernando's Lightning Furnace' has been successfully built in the soul, and the five rings have been promoted. Teachers can be asked to provide support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, before this The expression of the heat radiation is expressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Teacher Evans, are you five rings?" Sprint sprayed the milk out and the table was dirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He vaguely remembers that Evans was promoted to the Third Rings more than a year ago, so the promotion speed has never been heard! It is entirely possible for a teacher to become a high-level magician before the age of thirty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put the napkin aside and smiled: "From the help of external forces. It is only my own words, it will take three to five years to advance. Ok, I will continue to do the papers I have arranged today. You seem to be very leisurely. Then add one more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! Teacher Evans, I still have a lot Things to do!” Even if he was rebellious like Sprint, he heard the obvious fear of the test papers of Lucien, and the dark red hair that stood upright fell down funnyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the latest issue of "Arcane" was released three days in advance." Leo interrupted Lucien to appreciate the horrible taste of teenagers' fearful expressions. Pass the dark black book with countless silver lines to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
