			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark, the silver moon does not appear in the sky, and even the bright stars are only a few dozen visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood behind the thick brown curtains of the hotel and looked at the night quietly through the gap. The heart was a little disappointing because there was no silver moon. If you shine, you can't fully exert the power of the "moonlight" blood, except that the speed and agility can be equal to the official knight, and the others are only the level of the quasi-knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, you can see the stars, or you will have trouble calculating the lock entrance." Lucien himself comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the "Grand Cross" lock will vary depending on the position of the star borrowing power, changing every ten minutes, unless the sun rises, other The role of the stars is completely suppressed, otherwise if you can't directly see the stars to calculate, Lucien can only distress the thick stack of astrological maps and catalogs, calculate and summarize the past trajectories of the nine stars, and then In order to measure the current position, the amount of calculation is a bit large, "and there is no moonlight, and the darkness of the five fingers is more suitable for hiding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church steeple in the distance The big clock walked without hesitation, when the needle just pointed at eleven o'clock, Lu Xien returned to the bed and replaced the black hooded jacket that was rushed out a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling down the hood and walking to the window, when Lucien was ready to open a gap and smashed out, hesitated from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poetry, manuscripts appear too suddenly, too concentrated, it seems that many people have got a copy, the whole thing reveals the taste of conspiracy." Lucy Enben thought that the church used the hand of Lilith's brother and sister to test himself. From the mouth of the Rhine, I learned that the church could not extract the manpower recently, and then saw the dozens of strangers in the town of Masawa, who felt the mysterious taste. The things of the ruins are more and more confusing, not like the style of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it takes six to seven months from Aalto to Stourke, and there is no small possibility to get silver moon pharmacy from another way, such as In the hands of Stewart’s magical parliamentary liaison.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you really need to take risks?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is the unique lock of the legendary magician, Lucien believes that as long as he is not greedy, grasp the time difference, the return from the security of the remains may be very high, completely ignore the conspiracy of others, but fine When I think about it, I find that there seems to be no need to take risks. Because it is not the only material that can get the silver moon pharmacy there, and even another five years or so, waiting for his mental strength to reach a certain level through meditation, to analyze and master his own magic, to his own knowledge structure and depth. It is completely possible to build a spell model without using a pharmacy to become a true magician. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, soon, Lucien thought of a meaningful look at Rhine before leaving, letting himself feel a hunch through the star of destiny, it seems that something is about to happen. If you don't have the self-protection strength, you will probably die at that time, and: "The owner of poetry and manuscript seems to see the creation of Elsinore Lake and the arrangement of the locks. Who is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magician who left the book "The Book of Astrology and Elements" has the title of 'Prophet', and the lock is probably the one he personally arranged, perhaps he used to What is predicted and what is left in the lock..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many ideas are produced in Lucien’s mind, many desires are in the body of Lucien Emergence, he made his determination to go to the magic relics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the window, Lucien jumped out after the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In order to maintain physical strength, Lucien arrived in the small town of Bonn on the shores of Lake Elsin in an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small town on the edge of the Dark Mountain Range. It is remote and closed. Except for occasional musicians, painters, etc., it rarely communicates with the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no industry called "tourism" in this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sneak peek into the town is not closed and deserted, the only pub in the town is brightly lit, and the noise can be seen Identify the unique accents in many places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, what should I do? I thought that only we could read the manuscript through Mr. Evans, know the secrets of Lake Elsinore, the approximate range of the locked entrance after the sun rises, and the magic garden, the town of Bonn. How come there are so many people from other places? Lilith is not old, but she is not a ignorant girl when she grows up in a dangerous and depressed environment. She is very skeptical that the outsiders are also due to magical relics. Sarah sighed: "The manuscript we got was crippled, so it was necessary for Mr. Evans to look for background information from historical documents. They are very Probably got the full manuscript."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if there are any formal magicians, knights..." Lilith said worriedly, because the manuscript came The way that her opponent’s manuscript spread out did not cause doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sara looked at her feet and seemed to want to see the first floor of the pub directly through the floor, then shook her head: "The gentlemen of this rank How can I see that only those reckless, all-muscle adventurers in their minds have exposed their strengths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Cavaliers Sarah, who is a risk-seeker, is not in the eye. This is the confidence of a magic apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can't get in tomorrow?" Lilith asked hesitantly. Sarah’s expression changed intricately, and it took a while to answer: “Look at it first, there is no need to compete with them, and the proliferation of manuscripts seems to be a bit wrong. There are so many people who know. We can't worry, anyway, there will be twelve hours in the entrance to the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sharper than his sister, can be greedy to let him not Willing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is under their window, leaning against the wall of the back door of the pub, looking at the stars in the night sky and calculating with the nearby terrain that was previously clarified With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is a legendary level of locks, there are a lot of "parameters" to consider, and Lucien has calculated the position of the entrance for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the calculation, Lucien felt that he was dizzy and his brain was bloated, which was too expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there was still some time since the lock was opened, and Lucien hid in the dark corner and quietly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... The civilian houses sneaked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a lot of bright nights, and a black road to Sean seems to be integrated into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Switching" slight magical fluctuations appeared, the closed door quietly opened, Lucian flashed into the house and locked the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a man and a woman sleeping in the bedroom, completely unaware that strangers are diving in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien came in, he sat quietly on the wooden bench in the living room, without any other movements, seemed to be very leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But actually, Lucien was in the silent time, when he was about ten minutes approaching, he suddenly got up and went to the shadow of the corner of the living room. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of shadows looks normal, but when Lucien comes into contact with it, the whole person becomes illusory and transparent, and then completely disappears into the shadows and disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless ten seconds, this group of shadows is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the shadows, Lucien felt like he was passing through a thick credit with a violent dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the dizziness recovered, Lucien was surprised to find that he was still standing in the living room of the civilian house just now, and the things around him were exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to enter the lock?" Lucien looked around strangely and quickly found out that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
