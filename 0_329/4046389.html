			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the familiar dizziness, a fascinating flower that seems to have been full of blood is now in front of Lucien, like a red ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to sense the breath of the living, the flowers bloom slowly, one after another, the heavy dark red slowly unfolds, revealing the flesh and blood that keeps creeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, hey, they are expanding and contracting like Lucian’s heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole vertebrae of Lu Xien, a bit of sweat felt like an electric shock, chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange flower is fascinating to the extreme, and it seems dangerous to the extreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short-lived fear, Lucien quickly calmed down and understood that this was the "Observer Castle" garden described by Rhine, and the sound of the mouth was sharp and sharp. I read a mantra that a normal person could not finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this mantra, the fabulous flowers sway gently to make a welcome look, then quickly close and turn into a hair-sized hair Bloody bugs, dense and numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the tide faded, revealing the cold and wet black land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a flower, or a worm? Why have you never seen this magical creature..." Lucien is highlighted as an arcist researcher. I’m curious about the creatures that have not been included in this “High Arcane and Magic Library”. If you don’t know how dangerous a legendary garden is, you’ve been using magic to try to catch a few bugs. “Maybe It is an ancient creature that has become extinct..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While guessing, Lucien stepped out of the node transmission array and followed the black road that was cracked by the "red sea" Going to the main entrance of the hall, which is faintly visible in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody worms are gathering again, condensing out the fascinating flowers, giving off a strong sweet smell, just smelling, there are legs soft, The feeling of confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien subconsciously applied an air filter to keep the sweet fragrance out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating bright red flowers suddenly boiled, swaying toward Lucien, as if a ghoul had only extended his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are so keen on magical fluctuations?" and full of attack surnames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienqiang resisted the urge to cast magic against it, letting the creeping petals wander around their backs, they crossed their faces from time to time, causing itching Paralysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no more magical fluctuations, the "wavy" undulating red ocean does not see any signs of calming, "Rolling the claws" around Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien uses the Holm crown ring "electronics" to put himself in a very focused state, turning a blind eye to the dangers and horrors around him, not rushing Slowly move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not clear how horrible this is like a flower and a non-flower, a bright red creature like a worm, but with a dangerous premonition, Lucien Decide to be careful. Even if you can eliminate these monsters, there are certainly other high-order strange "plants" in the Rhine garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the "stunning waves", Lucien appeared to be calmly out of the "ocean" and embarked on a tree-lined road that leads directly to the main entrance of the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two rows of tall trees resembling phoenix trees planted next to the road. The half-yellow leaves are swirling and landing, creating a piece in front of the dark and gloomy castle. It is like the beautiful scenery of the Aaltoji area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked up the boulevard and headed for the main entrance of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a row of black and white eyes was opened above the tall trees like the phoenix tree, and each of the eyes reflected the figure of Lucien. On each road, Sean’s figure has different expressions, some doubts, some smiles, some anger, some cold, and their black eyes are staring straight at the authentic Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I was caught in a dream, I was born on the basis of Lu Xien’s subconscious impression of the Scarlet Tree, and there was a certain gap with the real one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic tree grows hard, but as long as it enters the maturity stage, it is the high-level strength. Like the eye magic, it is good at emitting various rays and likes blood-sucking. Good at creating fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many high-end magic items, Lucien self-confidently encounters one or two scarlet trees alone, and has enough confidence to turn them into materials. There are two rows here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a castle of legendary vampires." Lucien was in the real "all eyes", as if he had attended the banquet and walked to the main entrance of the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soft feeling under the feet became hard and smooth, Lucien quietly sighed and passed through the dense monsters. It was a very tough thing. Even if I have the spell that Rhine told me, the feeling of subconsciousness is inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of pressure, and Lucien stood quietly at the main entrance of the hall, but he had not raised his right hand, and a dull voice came from the inside of the castle. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel the mark of the owner on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I Entrusted by Mr. Rhein, come to the castle to take a few things." Lucien answered briefly. As long as you get the approval of the alchemy life of the castle, it is no danger to take away the deformation mask, the ceremonial artifacts, and the reward of the mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull voice with a resounding voice: "I am the castle 'Miklik', please read the general mantra."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clihamie." Lucien understood that the rhetoric of the Rhine set was actually a reversal of the name of the alchemy life, and could not help but laugh aloud: "There is no idea, It’s better to open the door with sesame!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Respected guests, please come in.” The castle’s door slowly opened, revealing a tastefully decorated hall, “except for the control core, The energy floor and the bottom of the treasure house, in the rest, as long as there is an opening spell, you can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ filled with different styles in different historical periods In the room of the book, Lucien followed the rhythm of the Rhine, while reading the mantra, while using the mental power to condense into a spike, and stabbed the pen holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a layer of faint light on the pen holder, giving a soothing mechanical rotation, slowly retreating to the side, revealing a black Round hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scrutiny, there was no problem, and Lucine’s hand took out a few things in the round hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a small statue of a sphinx, a filthy blood ball, a gorse brooch, and a clown mask that highlights a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deformation Mask, a nine-level intermediate magic item, the person wearing it can become any creature of the same name, but does not possess the natural talent of the creature. At the same time, if you collect the blood of the other party, you can completely change into the other party's appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are currently 7,895 different blood types recorded. The person wearing it can pick the deformation from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This deformation comes from the blood source, and if you don't step into the legendary field, you can't see through it, even if it is legendary. If you don’t discern carefully, you will be deceived.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“One of the spirits and the will must be at or near the high level to wear, otherwise it will be lost in different identities. In the middle, it becomes a complete madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many times, identity is better than magic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "-An anonymous magician of a 'mind split'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien "The information and structure of the clown mask clearly emerged in his mind, and the other three items, Lucien can only identify that they all contain strange and concealed supernatural energy, and the surnames are slightly different, it is the opening of three Ritual items of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the items and masks installed, Lucien took the time to “record” some of the books collected by Rhein into the Soul Library, and he claimed to be “historical observation”. "There is definitely an insane thing with value in it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
