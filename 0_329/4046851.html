			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic universe, Babel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of water-like glare from the "gate of time and space", instantly "lighting" the surrounding magic array, forming a line and The strange scene of the pattern moving in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the "gate of time and space" is no longer bleak, but brilliant, and cast a layer of distorted light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This layer of light suddenly bulged outwards, like a figure that couldn’t see the face. Then, the figure became clearer and clearer, and Lu Xi’an’s Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has just stepped out of the "gate of time and space", this door that turns to shine is immediately eclipsed, decayed and shattered, and instantly turned into a flying dust And the line that surrounds the magical array has also faded away from the hustle and bustle, and the inch has broken and become a pile of garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien saw that the hall was not only standing Natasha, but also the Speaker of the Speaker, he rarely lost peace and stability, his face There is some anxiety in the faint, not anxious of fear and excitement, but an anxiety to solve the inner doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien is not surprised by this. After realizing the "real world feedback" and seeing the vision of the sky, if the speaker is not looking for it, then It’s a puzzling thing. As for Natasha, she watched her send it away. She knew that whether she could find the sun or not, she should be able to return within half a day, naturally waiting patiently here, so that she could satisfy her curiosity for the first time. heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you find out?" Douglas did not surprise or doubt to ask if Lucien really found out, but asked him why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha opened her mouth and smiled. She wanted to ask what the sun looked like, whether it was a real materiality, and sent it over the distance. How far is it, but I heard Douglas ask questions, so I hold on to respect and courtesy, and I have time to ask anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed, it’s rare to see the president’s urgency, it’s like being possessed by the teacher, and he must go immediately after the promotion of the legendary peak. I have forgotten one thing I have done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of the Speaker, wait a minute." Lucien pressed his right hand, and suddenly there was a real world behind it. In this world, the sky The stars are indistinct, surrounded by a huge fireball burning with flames, which constitutes many complicated and mysterious figures. Behind the fireball, there is a deep darkness that seems to absorb the eyes and suck the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sky, one is like a real proton, and the neutrons form a nucleus. They are also diffuse at times, sometimes huddled, and composed of electrons of a probabilistic cloud state. The elements, and in different areas of elemental aggregation, have different beauty, such as liquids and solids that emit deep cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light flow between these charged objects seems to be divided into one copy, which reflects the essence of electromagnetic force, and the wind in the surrounding void The power is connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the whole world is faintly curved, but outside the bend, it seems to be connected to other things, so that changes in the cognitive world can affect the material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he saw the abnormalities in the solidified cognitive world, Douglas laughed at himself and how he forgot to become a legendary peak. The change of the knowing world maps to its own semi-position, making this half-plane more and more close to the alien space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cognitive world has just begun, and the Tower of Babel suddenly has a violent sway, from the sway of its own planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside of the dark universe shines a dazzling brilliance, the elemental planet erupts unimaginably bright, more and more real, especially that part The sun-like stars burned the flames, emitting horrible heat, almost real high temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the changes in the "atomic universe" subsided, the "cognitive world" projection behind Lucien disappeared, and Douglas asked again: "How did you find out?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien briefly replied: "The main consideration is two issues. Since our planet seems to be shrouded in 'fog', the endless Wang Yang will be rotated back and forth. When flying out of the atmosphere, it will lose its observation of the ground within a certain range until it enters the universe. Then we must assume two points. First, whether the light is coming in and the same situation is encountered. It is curved, and the other is whether other planets are also shrouded in such 'fog'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A long time ago, we considered whether the 'fog' of the atmosphere interfered with the path of light propagation, and considered whether it was the reason why we could not see the planet after we transmitted it to the planet. However, after so many years, we Still can't thoroughly study the 'fog' and study the specialities of the endless ocean." Douglas said his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generations of arcane masters are not fools, how can they not consider the two problems raised by Lucien, did not consider the impact of "fog", can be problematic Therefore, there is no way to find the cause and the difference from the exploration results and data, so as to establish a model and promote the discovery to the planet. If it is as simple as Lucien, the sun has been found hundreds of years ago! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Douglas is most concerned about why Lucien can find a way to correct the position of the sun from the data, which is the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s right hand five fingers relaxed, and then rubbed his chin, a little hesitant: "I can only say roughly, 'fog' and The speciality of the eternal depth of the ocean should be a spatial anomaly." Natasha next to Naxisha sees Lu Xi’s subconscious movement as soon as he sees Lu Xi’s subconscious movement. The heart is indeed full of contradictions, not deliberately not to make it clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The anomaly in space, the curvature of space is expressed as gravity, the gravity there is indeed abnormal, but..." Douglas sinks, combined with Lucien Ming’s attitude, he suddenly realized that “you are worried that your explanation will blow my head? Is this contradictory to general relativity?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi The grace of the forehead, the Speaker of the Lord is really intelligent, just inferring his own concerns from his own attitude and a little explanation: "Yes, there is a contradiction between general relativity and quantum mechanics, and I prefer quantum, but now I am also I can't guarantee my correctness, I am afraid to mislead you, thank you, so I can't rush out before I further verify my thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since can't To be correct, I just listened and didn't shake my cognitive world." Douglas smiled. "If you don't want to say it, you can give me some tips. I will study and explore it myself. In this way, I will Adjust your perception in the process Even if the final result contradicts the general theory of relativity, I don't know that the world is broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently nodded: "From very early on, I was thinking about why the planet could not be discovered. I had no idea until I opened the immortal chamber and saw the secret of immortality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret of immortality? "Douglas and Natasha have a loud voice at the same time, which is related to the secret of immortality." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien converged on mood swings and solemnly said: "The planet can't be found, the atmosphere is strange, the endless oceans are weird, those in the 'star tomb' Stars that seem to have no gravitation, the secret of immortality, the soul fireplace, and even the 'real world' are all different manifestations of the same problem. They must be seen together, and the research cannot be found separately."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it makes a lot of sense." Douglas thought carefully, and they really felt that they were a bit like each other. They seemed to hide countless similar mysteries, but he quickly wondered, "If both It is the different manifestation of the same problem. The strangeness of the atmosphere and the eccentricity of the endless oceans and seas should be the same, because there is no essential difference in the environment around them, but why do we fly to the atmosphere, but we can’t see it to some extent? The ground does not prevent us from flying into the universe, but the depths of the ocean will fly back to where we passed, and will always be there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien The situation is slightly dignified: "This is also my doubt. Where it needs to be verified, I have established a mathematical model for the speciality of the endless ocean, but this model is basically impossible to form naturally, although it can indeed be embedded in the abnormal space. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible to form naturally, do you mean man-made?" Douglas's expression also became dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s silver-purple eyes also flashed awe-inspiring emotions. If it is artificial, it is likely to lead to very terrible conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is such a possibility, there is a powerful person we don't know, others have created this kind of endless ocean, but this may be very Small, because it is meaningless, does not prevent us from finding the planet from the data collection, so I suspect that it is related to the mythological era, after all, this is the only era we basically do not understand." Lucian said his own speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
