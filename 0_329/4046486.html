			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Moon Alliance League Allinge Division, the hall is shrouded in a layer of cold radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Urisian, what is the banquet today? Why did I see the middle and high-level magicians of the 'Elemental Will' organization?" A seemingly stunted skinny The man looked puzzledly and looked around. It looked like he was only 17 or 18 years old, but his tone was completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black-brown young man opposite him, with a faint smile on his angular face: "How do I know. Your president informed me." I am here, anyway, this boring banquet, I will leave as soon as I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian wears five silver stars in the chest The five black ring magic badges have benefited from the influence factor in these years. His arcane level has improved by one level, and the same, because he likes to fight, he often hones his magical ability, and the magic level is also improved. A ring is sprinting toward the higher order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Ulysian, why didn't you continue to study after discovering the photoelectric effect, let Lucien propose the light quantum hypothesis? For you, we still Can barely accept." Several other middle-level magicians of the electromagnetic system came around and said to Yurisian with a slight lament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian gently shakes the golden liquor in his hand, still a faint smile: "Bono, Feiya, how do you know that I have not studied? It is proposed that the optical quantum hypothesis does not rely solely on experimental research, but also relies on more open thinking and is more immune to the imagination of the past theory. After I read Lu Xien’s energy discontinuity paper, I forgot it on the bookshelf. To make this hypothesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bono is the thin man before, the magical talent is stronger than the arcane talent, is the most in the "Silver of the Silver Moon League" I hope to be one of the high-level backup magicians. At this time, he is a bit gnashing: "I can think of the damn Lucian, I am angry that I want to destroy it with a spherical lightning! My teacher is like that because of the quantum Assume that the cognitive world is broken and solidified, and my friend bursts his head in front of me, and the brain blood splashes me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If going out Adventure encounters him, I will definitely find him trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for trouble? He is a high-level magician. How can you find a five-ring magician to find him? And he is the magical equipment that receives the honorary awards. Enough to let him compete with the seven-ring magician, not to mention the 'new alchemy', the future arcanist." Feiya said harshly, but her bitterness is more bitter, weak and sad for reality. Bitter, because the guy who broke his head was a friend of her and Bono. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bono is annoyed and said: "I know, but I don't think I will be mad, at least, I saw Lucien, I have the courage to marry him. Spit him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's just the courage of the deaf, I have it." Fia's eyes were a little red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urisian with a sneak smile, quietly listening to them, the conversation of other mid-level magicians, high-level magicians From time to time into his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you see Lucien Evans, I will ask him in person how to explain the interference and diffraction of light using the quantum theory of light."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day, I will use a similar volatility hypothesis to explode his head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter him In the field of elements and alchemy, whether the level of the Arcane Master is reached, the electromagnetic and light dark things are definitely not something that their group of research particles can understand! The light quantum hypothesis may be only part of a correct wave theory, we have not lost, We also have classic electromagnetic theory and experimental images!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lost puppy always screams..." Yuris Ann whispered in his heart. One sentence, not because they are high-level or big masters have some convergence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of banquet occasion, the topic is almost all around Lucien, showing the electromagnetic, light and dark and most other faction's magician hypothesis about light quantum and his My abomination, and the magicians in the field of elements and alchemy are excited to discuss "new alchemy", even if they have been discussing for many days before, and between the talks, it is touting Lucien as the future Arcanist. The legendary peak, is expected to take on the man of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuris looked up and saw that the president, Mr. Joaquim, stood with a young man from a handsome Sven to the center of the platform: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. Lucien Evans." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien? Evans? Seeing this young man, Bono’s eyes suddenly showed the scene of a friend exploding his head in front of him. Everything was excitement, but soon, the white brain flowers and the bright red blood were overwhelming. In the smell, the headless body slowly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this thing all the time, in addition to anger, Bono has produced an unspeakable fear. It seems that I look at this man and I will be like a friend. Then the head blew open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinking, the exquisite wine glass slipped from Bono’s hand and fell on the carpet, turning into countless pieces, and the bright red wine was soaked in the ground. It was like the ground that had not been cleaned at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the broken glass seems to have formed a chain reaction, slamming, there are dozens of cups in the ground, and looking at the color of the wine, Feiya is I couldn’t help but bend over and retched, and the cup fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the glasses in the hands of many magicians are broken and the wine is splashed, but they are smashed by their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression on their faces is distorted, and there is deep fear in hatred of hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sound of the break, the atmosphere in the whole hall was quiet, like solidification, and it seemed that even the breath disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies..." Lucien stepped forward and politely bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just issued a word, Lucien saw that many of the magicians below were subconsciously retreating, their heads swaying, as if they were going to say everything they said. They are excluded from the brain, otherwise they will be detonated. Inside, there are several high-ranking magicians who are known by Lucien, who are also known as the "Silver of the Silver Moon". They also take a step back from the underground consciousness of faint fear, and worry about the theory of extreme subversion from Lucien’s mouth. The one who died in the headshot, the magician who knows the broken and solidified world is still vivid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere has become very quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the legendary fire prevention and anti-theft road?" Lu Xien self-abdominal, this is simply the debut of the villains, the devil, and It’s not like a banquet, no one has a bear child, or else a crying bear child can’t cry because of this repressed atmosphere. The rumor that “Lu Xi’s name can stop the children’s nightingale” is sure. I love it in Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, Noahin is quite dissatisfied with the performance of some "Silver of the Silver Moon" magician, and then hate disgusting Lu Xien can not lose a decent. With his cough, the atmosphere gradually warmed up, but no one dared to practice his previous promises, went to Lucian to debate the interference experiment of light, to swear him, to spit his mouth, as if there was an invisible momentum in his body. With his own thoughts, it is the momentum brought by many broken skulls and blood brains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today we held this banquet to present the twenty-first silver medal to Mr. Lucien Evans in recognition of his light quantum hypothesis The outstanding contributions made in the field of electromagnetics and light and darkness.” Noahin’s voice said with a slight sadness that the awards established to commemorate the theory of volatility and classical electromagnetic theory actually overturned its hypothetical awards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian looked at Lucien very calmly. After three years of gestation, the light quantum hypothesis has long been accepted, there is no sad mood, after all, Young non-conservative new generation of arcane masters, but this sentence of Noahkin made him once again find the place of the abdomen: "Excellent contribution? Contributed to a body with no head and more broken cognitive world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magicians suddenly realized that this was the silver medal medal's awards dinner. It seems that Lord Brooke has found a phenomenon that can prove the quantum hypothesis. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always feel that entanglement in particles or waves is a very stupid thing." Lucien slammed the demon king before taking the Silvermoon Medal. "Recognizing the results of each experiment, acknowledging that it shows the volatility and particle surnames respectively is a very difficult thing? We should look at it from a higher perspective. This micro-world thing may be beyond our imagination. We can only rely on experimental results and mathematical equations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
