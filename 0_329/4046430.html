			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the Icemoon comes very early, and the small but dense snow flutters in an elf-like light in the arc of the streetlights, holy and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians on the street are quite rare, they are replaced by a variety of thick coats, while shaking the snow, while rushing forward, refused to stop Enjoy this beautiful view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so beautiful...but why they melt." Avery’s film of “palm” turned into water stains, and his heart hurts. Muttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkling shimmer, well-structured snowflakes are very much in line with its aesthetics, or if you know the essence, it wants to collect them, so Affris I hate winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Lucien "signed a hundred-year contract partner", Aphrodite gobbled up the half-baked whole lamb, and then happily Followed him to Renttat, in order not to scare the ordinary citizens, it used illusion to disguise as a seven-eight-year-old boy, linen hair, amber eyes, wearing a small suit, with a small tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, know Arthur, the cute little boy? Doyle is leaning against the corner of the carriage, and his body trembles slightly. Even if he is well-informed and his position is not low, he is inevitably afraid when facing a legendary "monster." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arc lamp is too hot, and the price is too expensive, even the city of Rentat can not be popular, only the aristocratic area and the most prosperous market area Only then." Lu Xien, who has become a Holmian style dress, smiles and looks out of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desire for wealth allowed Arthur to overcome the fear and follow Lucien’s gaze to look out at the night, eagerly: “When the magic crystal lamp withstands the use The test, the cost is reduced again, I will talk to the governor of Rentent City Hall, let the streets of the whole city use our magical street lights, this will be a great asset, and can be extended to other countries in the future. Other cities..." He could not have imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afris, who heard the word "wealth" jerked back, staring at Arthur, trying to figure out what they were talking about, scared Arthur almost knocked over the white glazed porcelain cup on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very rewarding business, Affris, if you want to join, you have to come up with your own collection, with gold, gems and Crystal shares." Lucien is purely a teasing of Aphrodite, but if it really wants to join, the elemental will should not mind, the initial production and promotion is a lot of cost, and before the cost is reduced again It may not be universal, and it will definitely make Morris very sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, come up with gold, gems, and crystals..." Affris is not calm, unable to make a foolish look, and is caught in an extreme contradiction. And tangled, one side is the rich income of the long-term, the other side is the cute gold, jewel, crystal of the treasure chest, it wants both! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fierce inner struggle, Affris even the carriage has arrived at the villa of the Duke of James in the aristocratic district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to our youngest and most handsome arc auditing committee member Evans. If not my daughter and granddaughter are already married, they will definitely come to me. You know." The Duke of James, who looks like a bald-headed man, smiled and greeted him. He and his guests were in the garden, waiting for something with a warm bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and walked down the carriage: "You were greeted by the Duke of James, this is the treatment that the king and the prince have. It’s a great honor, why everyone Didn’t you go in?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark villa, without a light, seems to be integrated with the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because all the candlesticks in the villa have been replaced with magic crystal lamps, wait for them to light up in the dark in the evening. So commemorative things, of course, wait for guests We all started when we got together.” The bald head of James Duke reflected the orange glow under the bonfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you are really a young literary artist, not right, the old man of literature and art, Lucien laughed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden has been specially arranged, even if there is only a bunch of bonfires, it does not make people feel cold, a lady, lady, lady, not only did not complain, Instead, I was very interested in this strange form of banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the two men and a woman, James pointed to Lucien: "This does not need me to introduce it, you should all know, six-level arcane, five-ring magician, the youngest member of the Arcane Review Committee, The genius Mr. Lucian Evans, who received the two highest honors of the element and the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien has not submitted his magic level yet. I plan to wait until this time to say good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Evans." Black and white mixed hair combed back to the meticulous old man, and a young man, a man and a woman, respectfully Salute: "Hello, Evans Commissioner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the sixth-level arcian of the electromagnetic system, the seven-ring magician Barrebe Pfeiffer Mr. Si, he is the student of the 'master of control' Brooke." James introduced Lucy to the serious old man with linen eyes. "These two are his students, middle-level magician Lillian and Isaac. "Lianlian is a beautiful girl with long brown hair. Isaac seems to have a blood giant's blood. She is tall, muscular, and has a flame color." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Pephos, Lillian, Isaac, I am very glad to meet you." Lucien said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James smiled: "Barek is a friend of my childhood. Later, because I couldn’t stimulate my blood, I embarked on the path of the magician. I can’t think of this. On the way, he bloomed with dazzling light, and he was seen by the master of Brooke, and he became a high-level arcane master. Maybe he will be able to surpass me who started a lot earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time trying new alchemy items involves the electromagnetic field he is good at, so please ask him to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds, Barre Ke is a small aristocratic family. Although there is no title, it is also one of the representatives of the parliamentary pro-aristocratic faction. Lucien was gradually expanded by the introduction of the enlightened circle of the Duke of James and others by Prince Patrick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, the electrons you find have a great role in the electromagnetic system, and many explanations have a deeper meaning." Barrek seems to be less enthusiastic. Communicative, talking directly about the arcane problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also happy to talk with Barrek about the possible significance of electronic research in the field of electromagnetics, Lillian and Isaac do not dare to interject I listened attentively to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, have you heard of the recent experiment by Douglas Speaker?" Barrek suddenly mentioned one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head in a blank voice: "You know, I concentrated on analyzing magic and improving my strength during this time, and I didn't pay attention to the latest research." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Douglas Speaker designed an experiment that 'confirmed' that there is no relative 'ether' medium motion, the speed of light is the same in all directions." Barrek The tone is plain, not like discussing a topic that should be hot recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly realized that, in the absence of other things, Speaker Douglas finally completed the experimental design mentioned in Thaksin and obtained the result, denying " The existence of the etheric medium, without the "ether" medium, as the "wave" of light can not reach the ground from the sun, the world should be dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This negates the volatility of light from the reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, what do you think about this experiment?" Barreque’s linen eyes became brighter and his expression was more serious, it seemed that Lucien’s The answer will be the key to his ability to be a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his expression, Lucien’s heart stunned, the gap between the wave and the particle school is so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the main problem of the elementary teacher and the electromagnetic teacher in the original magic school is that the electromagnetic system supports fluctuations, and the elemental system is more biased toward particle theory. Lucien had a deep understanding of the main contradiction throughout the history of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people open their eyes, they feel the light. Through the contrast between day and darkness, ancient humans are full of worship of light, which is considered to represent life and sacredness. Since the birth of magic, there is no lack of exploration of the essence of light. After the magicians discover that spiritual power is similar to light, the study and understanding of light has become one of the eternal mainstream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
