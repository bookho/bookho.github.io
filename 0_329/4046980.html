			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He? No wonder..." Fernando whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although "real dreams" are the talents of the vampire family, they can do their best to connect so many people's dreams together, each with its own thinking The ability, then only the blood of the legendary king of Dracula - the fallen Abel overall strength is stronger than Dracula, but above the "real dream", but worse than Dracula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that Dracula, in addition to creating a dream of unity of all, can be born out of nothing, relying on his own devouring and plundering talent to materialize his dreams. Life is like real, can think and communicate, but does not know that it is false, it is part of the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec continues to explain to Fernando: "Dream Aalto will cover up the real Alto, effectively preventing the raids of church legends, and, blood, elves, dragons Between the dwarves and our human beings, we have accumulated a lot of contradictions over the years. If we always restrain ourselves, it will cause big conflicts. Now it is very good. It is just a dream. If there is any contradiction, even if it is vented, it can be resurrected after death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he smiled a little proudly: "The vast majority of the power of Dream Aalto comes from Prince Dracula, but the teacher, Stanis Other students, as well as me, have made some contributions, so I can detect that you are entering the dream for the first time, and come to 'connect' you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando looked at the weak and timid friend deeply and found that he finally burst into a light of his own, and snorted: "Your contribution may not be as big as a fingernail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I was promoted The order did not take long. "Antec am not inferior. On the contrary, he was quite proud. Being a high-ranking magician was his dream when he was young. As for the higher order, he couldn’t even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and turned his attention to the battle ahead. The more you watched, the more shocked, the blood and the elves’ talents, the melee ability, the bow and arrow dagger. I can't see a little falsehood at all, even the aftermath of the battle is so real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'real dream' is not as bad as I thought." He reluctantly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec is very clear about the character of a friend. This is just a slap in the face: "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not annoyed, but suddenly thinks of another thing: "Dracula in Aalto At this time, should he not be on the line of Tria, or near Lance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coalition’s counterattack against the church was completely curbed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two days ago, Griffith became the new pope, renamed Gregory, the day, Prince Dracula, Taikoo Time Dragon, Elf Queen, Earth The goddess, the five legendary peaks of the eternal king of the ocean, the sun king, the star tutor, the elemental dominator, the tower student, the summoning master, the metamorphic master, the devil king, the demigod lich, the Taikoo red dragon, the Prince Sette, etc. Many third-order powerhouses, as well as teachers and other legends, once again raided Lance, which is the strongest force that can be mobilized in addition to the 'main brain' of the Dark Mountain Range." Antec’s mood is low. But it is still a good introduction to the current situation of the coalition forces for friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same as "The Sun King." "Star Tutor" is not the legendary figure who created the star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The endless king of the ocean also participated in the war? The result is still a failure?" Fernando asked dignifiedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec nodded: "The endless king of the ocean has to fight, if the church of truth wins, the sea will not be calm, so the nine sea generals and others The forces of the sea attacked the coastal cities of the church at the same time. They dragged the left-behind saints, ordinary cardinals and epic knights, and they secretly came to Lance to participate in the war."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and his expression was a little sad: "The church is ready, and Gregory shows the true power of God, plus the king of angels, Ivan, Rudolph, Philippine Lix, Hoffenberg, Waorit and other strong help, repelled our full-scale attack without any damage, even, even if we retreat in time, I am afraid that many of you will be degraded."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The successor has the power of the gods... It seems that regardless of whether the old pope died in advance because of the 'God Fall', the new pope has a level of God-like." Fernando muttered to himself, this fact is really happy. Come, then, he asked urgently, "there is no legend peak fall no 'God descending surgery'??" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"It seems that he has to 'adapt' for a period of time to master the 'God Drop'. Otherwise, in such a big battle, killing a legendary peak with 'God Drop' will cause the coalition's confidence to collapse and completely collapse." Fernando I have always looked down on clergy, including the pope, and believe that their strength is not from themselves, easy to obtain and easy to lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily." Antec subconsciously retorted, "The Pope will use the "God Drop" to kill a legendary peak, and the rest will definitely Fear and fear, but will work harder to wipe out the hidden dangers that directly threaten life. When will the Pope use the 'God Drops' several times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If they are all magicians of the empire, there is still this possibility, but Dracula, Danisos, the Empress Queen, the Mother Earth, the Lord of the Endless Oceans have contradictions between each other, and even several people can’t wait to kill If you drop the other person, who would be willing to sacrifice yourself, consume the Pope’s second hair, "God Drop", and smash his weak and weak opportunity to kill him?" Fernando unrelentingly exposed Antec's reverie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec insisted on his own opinion: "Whoever sacrifices is not decided by himself, is the Pope. If they withdraw, they will only be killed by the Pope one by one." There was no other possibility. At that time, I could fight together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s too naive, the pope who consumed the 'God Drop' also has a kind of god. Strength.” Fernando sneered, then he looked at the sky, “unless Silver Moon can recover before the Pope restores the 'God Drop'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the best situation.” Antec sighed slightly, “I can’t do it, then...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he suddenly shut up Looking forward, it seems that the battle that is coming to an end has deeply attracted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what?" Fernando questioned doubtfully, and there was a speculation in his heart. The magicians may have their own plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec said with a smile: "Then fall back into the dark mountains, where the environment is complex and not afraid of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, lying coward," Fernando commented briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, I really think so." Antec said with sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando ruthlessly debunked his mind: "You are you, other people may not think so, even if the dark mountain environment is more complicated, the church will advance a little. There will always be no hiding places for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, you will know when you get there." Antec is tight-lipped, "Okay, I will take you into the real world." Aalto, hey, actually how good life is in such a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too addicted, the illusionist who is confused by his dream will sooner or later go crazy. Fernando reminded me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec nodded, no snoring, his right hand pressed over Fernando's shoulder. A wave of ripples radiated from his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of Fernando suddenly swayed, gradually blurred, and then. The bang was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short darkness fades. Fernando had a bright sun in front of him, and the long-awaited city of Aalto was in front of him, and he had not yet entered the city gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His side, Antec emerged, communicating with him while carrying him through the heavily guarded city gates - fear of being unaffected by dreams Special vigils arrived. Enter the real Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real Aalto street is empty, there is no one in a few hundred meters, silent, like a pale sneaky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of them are sleeping." Antec pointed to his head. "The food eaten in the dream comes from the power of Prince Dracula. Can directly Replenish energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ordinary people may not be able to withstand such a dream for too long." Fernando said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec nodded: "At most three years, they will be reminded to wake up. Hey, Fernando, I want to ask you a favor, help, Help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
