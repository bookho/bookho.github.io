			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien carries a white glazed porcelain cup, slightly jaws: "I know. People who sit in his position, if they are not ruthless, have long changed There is no bone in the grave outside the wild. Unfortunately, even the guards around him are not clear, or else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperature is flat and peaceful, but Leo is I feel that it is cold and cold. My employer is a kind of cool and terrible magician. If he knows now that there are several powerful guards around Ivanovsky, he will immediately analyze their defense loopholes and psychological blind spots. And the possible surnames and risk surnames that are planned to be completed, and strive to eliminate hidden dangers in the shortest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I helped Ivanovsky, he only had a big knight or a mid-level magician on the face, but he definitely There are hidden. On several occasions, the assassin sent by the competitor did not even reach his side, and he died inexplicably outside the house. One of the assassinations was a second-level knight who was good at hiding, and the sneak attack seriously injured his big knight. After seeing it, he will succeed. After the darkness, the assassin has fallen to the ground and his expression on his face is full of panic.” Leo told the Ivanovsky’s things that he knew completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face was smiling with a smile: “I just summoned the 'invisible servant’ to follow, but I was almost found. I also confirmed Iraq. Wannowski's room is surrounded by hidden magic effects such as 'discovering invisibility' and 'avoiding detection'. It is difficult to spy, so if you want to get rid of him, you can't assassinate him in the place he ordered, but let He followed our rhythm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master." Leo hesitated, "If you give me a mid-level magic item, I will look for it." The opportunity is the same as Ivanovsky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, the main reason why the assassins can not kill Ivanovsky is reluctant Your own life, if you don't even have your own life, it is entirely possible to get rid of Ivanovsky before being killed by the great knight and the mid-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around the house: "It is not necessary for the time being, you should rest first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At present, his biggest advantage is that Ivanovsky is not aware of his own strength. Whether he is to assassinate or use other means, he is likely to make mistakes. And such an error is his own chance, and he can eat away his men separately. Of course, if he does not have the murderous mind, it is the best result, so there is no need to send Leo to do a human bomb to cause Ivanovsky to be alert and let him deal with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien secretly arranged a hidden magical array unique to the Magic Council. It does not stop others from snooping. The only effect is to increase the sensitivity of the magical force's mental field, so that it can detect extremely small and abnormally convergent magical fluctuations - that is, under normal circumstances, it cannot be sensed at the current level. Arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is soft and quiet, Lucien is backed by the sofa and closes his eyes. It seems to have entered sleep during the moon-watching process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting darker and quieter, and Lucien suddenly feels the tiny magical fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost integrated with the breeze in the dark, and if it is not arranged in advance, Lucien can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical volatility is almost flat, but it has been hanging in the air, illuminating Lucien like a mirror, observing his every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien occasionally twisted his body as if he had fallen into deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "harmony" scene continued until dawn, and nothing happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Ural City, "Green Rattan" Premium Inn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods that will be brought in this bustling city have been filled with a lot of irons, and Berf is very laid back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With breakfast, he has been sitting in the corner of the hotel lobby, drinking spirits, while doing nothing to look at the guests coming and going, and whispering with Another alcoholic character judges the other person's identity, status, hobbies and surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilff took a cellar and smiled sullenly: "Xiao Lena, I will leave the Ural City to go home tomorrow, let me have a good day, and the more I drink, the more spirit I have." The next stop is the end of the caravan, the capital of the province of Kinov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, you have been drinking for two days!" Lena frowned. "Then you promise not to drink a drop of wine from the Ural city to your home." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berffhaha smiled and said: "Little Lena, don't you think that if I get drunk, I will agree indiscriminately, breakfast wine, lunch wine and dinner wine. Still have to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just finished, he jerked up and swayed a little: "Mr. Peter, welcome back, I thought you would stay In the Baroness Carlylena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is awkward, not like an old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien is coming in with Leo from the hotel door, the blonde is bright and full of energy - after breakfast, the cary is obviously cold Lina sent a coachman to send her to Xi'an, which is in line with Lucien's thoughts, but did not relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Mr. Peter." Lena was very happy. She always thought that Mr. Peter was a serious gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at her and Igor smiled: "Miss Lena, good morning. You seem to be reconciled? Then I am relieved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obvious jokes made Lena look blushing, and Igor, a young man who didn’t like Lucien, shook his head slightly shyly. I don't know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there was a drunkard next to the topic, and Bilff patted Lucien’s shoulder and comforted him: “Mr. Peter, don’t be depressed, you In fact, it is very popular with girls. Hey, Mrs. Carlylena probably only likes the orthodox Shahran man, who is tall and rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Lucien was a few centimeters tall, and compared with most men in the Shahran Empire, he was still short, and his body was even more distant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the war of Bilff, the ambiguous atmosphere quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Igor and his sweetheart, after a good mood, suddenly remembered something: "Right, Mr. Peter, you are going back to the room to see your luggage! Yesterday I was too happy late, I couldn't sleep, and I heard that there was a slight noise from your room next door and it quickly disappeared. I don't know if it was my hallucination or a mouse or a thief..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Leo and looked at the same dignity, then smiled calmly: "Thank you for your reminder, Igor. I will go back to the room." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the room, Lucien carefully examined the magic marks and teacups, kettles, etc. that he left in the hidden place, slightly confused. Leo said: "There is no magic trap, no poison, is it really a mouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic trap in Lu Xien’s words no longer refers to The apprentice's simple magical array, but returned to the original meaning of the trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, it shouldn't be so coincidental." Leo has a lingering enthusiasm for Ivanovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and looked around the room again, checking for one item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suitcase that was opened by himself, the "washing" clothes, the collected folk music manuscripts, and the pieces on the road were bought and sold as special items for travel commemoration... When Lucien's spirit was concentrated on a colorful doll, she finally felt the weak and vicious atmosphere contained in it. It set off the exaggerated funny face of the doll with a bit horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Curse?" Lucien, who has been studying this aspect of knowledge in the past year, is keenly judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo looked at the doll with the eyes of Lucien: "Master, is it a problem? What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien indulged for a few minutes and smiled: "Do what a nobleman should do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
