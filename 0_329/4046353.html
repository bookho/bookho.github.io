			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, "Arcane" was released as scheduled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Razard, such as Lazar, Rock, Jerome, etc., have entered the "Atomic Research Institute" and have ample arcane points. Ordinary low-level arcanes borrowed from the school or the basic arcane library to save money, and they were able to buy it by hand and read it as a reference for future research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't imagine there is such a hypothesis, but in this case, the formula seems to have a complete arcane meaning." "Atomic Research Institute" small meeting Indoors, while waiting for Lucien to come, Lazar expressed his surprise aloud, but because of the lack of research on the whole heat radiation arcane knowledge, coupled with the repeated emphasis of the Arcanists and the auditors, he was not too The shake, anyway, is only a hypothesis. In the future, we should be able to find other common sense explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the arcane master who has personally deduced the formula will only see Lu Xi’an’s analysis when he has been vetoed from all angles. When I couldn't restrain myself from believing that hypothesis, and this contradicted the foundation of the arcane world and the theory of Lord Brooke, there was a strong conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock stood up in excitement and walked around: "Only Lucien can make this unimaginable assumption, great, I I like this kind of subversion too much. Oh, I have to give him a hug. He is the object that I yearn for and learn! How can arcane research be like a pool of dead water without a movement? It must be full of storms!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he only hates the assumption that this contradiction with the current arcane system is not his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome’s face became a bit poor, but he quickly recovered calm: “For the time being, just a hypothesis, we don’t need to think too much, just use the formula. Now, wait for the judges and gentlemen to make a judgment and discuss the problem of continuous energy discontinuity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, it is a steady Jerome." He made a joke and didn't put this assumption into his mind, or deliberately didn't take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Katrina, Annick, Heidi and other magic apprentices sit quietly, have no understanding, this knowledge is too far away from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien walked in with a thick stack of papers and the "Arcane" journal, smiling around the conference room: "We started Discuss the experimental situation in the last week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the city of Allinge, in the magic tower, under the shade, in the carriage, I don’t know how many arcans are Looking at the "Arcane", which represents the most cutting-edge knowledge of magic and arcane research, one by one was stunned by the bold assumptions of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it didn't take long, the whisper of a sentence "This is just a hypothesis" sounded no big difference, vaguely revealing a hint of fear and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is only necessary to use formulas and constants to transform the corresponding magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cathode Ray, what is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Rantart, Holm Royal Magic Tower, Elemental Will Headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall and honest K is reading the "Arcane" carefully, his hands are faintly shivering, his arcane badge is already three silver stars, surrounded by silver dots It seems to be endless, it seems that it is not far from the fourth-level Arcanist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The valence theory, the perfection and quotation of ionization theory have brought him substantial benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans is a genius without any restraint." A sigh came from the door, and Larry, with a round face and a beard, held "Arcane." Going in, the arc badge of the chest has also been upgraded to five silver stars. "If it is me, I can never make such a hypothesis. I can't imagine that I will completely abandon the foundation of the arcane system."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K sounds low: "Although it is only a hypothesis, it is also scary. I can't imagine the scene it was set up. The council did not know what kind of winds and waves would be set off, and Lucien How much pressure will it bear..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t think too much, we continue our research." Larry understands the horror behind this hypothesis, Even the enlightened middle-level arcane masters will take a long time to accept slowly. "Yes, given my contribution to the atomic price and ionization theory, the gentlemen decided to award me the Holm Crown Award, the ring. The name is 'ionization'. K, you are my assistant, My research helped greatly, I'm sorry I did not fight for the opportunity to share your "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;The Holm crown was awarded three times in a row, and the treasury of the elemental will be in a state of blood loss, which made Morris heartache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K has no opinion on this. This is the rule of the Magic Council. It is a special case like Isabella and Rachel. He scratched his head and showed a thick and honest Smile: "It doesn't matter, teacher, what I am most confused about now is, why do the ions of matter carry positive and negative electricity separately? What is the law behind it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You started asking why, like the one with the same name as yours, this is our next research focus." Larry touched his yellow-brown beard and tweeted, "In addition, we also measured The cathode ray newly discovered by Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Northland, a crystal clear ice palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be in another world, completely unaffected by the storm and faintly connected to several strangely blurred worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study room of the palace, like Helen, the beautiful snow and ice elf? Paris holds the "Arcane" journal and holds a letter in his hand to read:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I want Lucien Evans in thermal radiation The contribution of the field is enough to obtain the Ice and Snow Medal. Although his assumption of energy as a share has not been confirmed, he can actually make an explanation, and his formulas and constants are so correct, and the improvement of magic in this field is remarkable. Role..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have to admit that I like the idea of ​​energy, or quantum..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend Derek Douglas"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading Helen, he thought for ten minutes and brought a pen to Douglas to reply:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...As far as I know, Lucien Evans’s explanation is not universally accepted, or that almost no one recognizes that many arcans are Try another explanation. Now, awarding the Ice and Snow Medal to him will cause doubts from all the magicians in the parliament. The credibility of the item is a blow to destroy the surname... Evans is a student of Fernando, and this is more cautious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If you don’t People put forward new explanations, and Evans formulas and constants are widely recognized in practical applications. At that time, it would not be too controversial to issue the Ice and Snow Medal to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Atomic Research Institute meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... After a few previous experiments, I found that cathode rays can only travel a few centimeters in the air, which is one of the reasons that have not been discovered in the past... ..." Lazar's face was ruddy, and his smile was brilliantly telling his own research. The glass that reflects the green fluorescence is part of the discharge magic array and the alchemy platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Lucien’s “Tips,” this month’s passionate study, Lazar, Rock, Jerome each completed at least More than seven papers, Annick, Sprint, Lei Yi Liya and other apprentices have also written four experimental papers, Lu Xien's own papers are up to ten, respectively, using different substances to verify the cathode ray Absorption, penetration of surnames, and changes in the position of obstacle shadows under the action of strong magnetic fields and electric fields. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it is concluded that the cathode ray is likely to be a negatively charged particle stream and is designed with a clean ray isolation device to pass the cathode ray in the electromagnetic field. The trajectory of the motion determines its charge-to-mass ratio, and this data is used to roughly determine what particle it belongs to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the cathode ray can penetrate the metal foil, Rock and Jerome also suspect that it may not be a particle stream, but what is specific, they have no complete idea Because the measurement of the cathode ray velocity smashes it is the possible surname of the electromagnetic wave (light wave) - much smaller than the speed of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrival of Lazar, Rock also reported his progress: "...there is no continuous surname deflection of the cathode ray in a strong electromagnetic field, maybe we Judging that it is charged is a mistake. The previous experimental result is probably due to the illusion caused by the complex gas environment inside the magic array..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so too. "Jerome and Lazard each agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
