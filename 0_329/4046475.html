			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." Diana’s voice was weak and ethereal, as if she had fallen into a nightmare that would never wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel’s sorrowful yellow-brown pupil is unexpectedly painful and frightening. I thought the teacher was stubborn again. The buffer cushioning, at the same time, is that the cognitive world is broken and solidified, and it will not endanger life. With the magical power of his nine-ring Master, even if the age is close to three hundred, it can be transformed into a lich or other life. It may not be impossible to find such a small opportunity to reconstruct the cognitive world, but now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! The teacher is not dead, the teacher must not die!" Corey Stern shouted unacceptably, his white hair became messy with his violent shaking of his head, and his wrinkled and distorted face was very embarrassing. "The teacher used life to hide!"<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nine-ring Master, Roland has enough power and knowledge to prevent accidental "death", although not as good as the Lich's amulet, but life-hiding It is also enough to deal with most of the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana buried her face in her hands, a painful and awkward nightmare: "Useless, useless, this is the complete destruction of the cognitive world, even with the talisman Life and death can't be revived..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the current magician, the soul and physical vitality can be divided by magic, such as life, life, and so on. If the hidden items are not broken, I will not really die. I can recognize that the world is still illusory and ethereal. It seems to be rooted in the magician's consciousness and cannot be attacked by magic, magic and knights. Nature can't be used by them, so it can't be divided, can't be copied. Once the cognitive world collapses and destroys, it brings about the true death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the semi-planet of a legendary magician, although the meditation environment is projected in the real world, the change in the cognitive world will bring about its corresponding changes, but in turn If it is not established, even if the half-face is destroyed by the enemy, it will not affect the cognitive world of the legendary magician. For example, in the illusion, by constructing the subversion theory, the enemy’s cognitive world collapses, and the head explodes. The reality is that you are in a state of stagnation. If you want to collapse the cognitive world in illusion and explode your head to reality, only the "King of Nightmare" can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one possibility to resurrect from the "collapse and destruction" of the cognitive world, that is, his cognitive world has not completely collapsed. In the case of psychological preparation or faintly shaken early, the cognitive world is in a state of broken coagulation and collapse and destruction. It can seize the opportunity to transfer the soul before its destruction spreads, offset by the explosion of the head. The impact. For a magician who has no life and no other means of resurrection, this possibility is also equivalent to the complete destruction of the cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the teacher like this? Who killed him? Is Lucien? Evans wants to stop him from completing the experiment?" Cristall sounds mad The mantle rushed to the experimental table with blood from the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the huge blows, seemingly unconscious, Collester, Manuel and Diana were shocked by his crazy violent behavior. Coupled with the shock and horror that Roland did not have the head of the brain, they seemed to be dull even after the reaction, but Wood was confused to see that Collester picked up the experimental notes and watched him look incredulously toward the magic array. And alchemy equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It must have been tampered with, it must be!" The crazy Krester opened the magic array and experimented with the last set of data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubled...Manuel thought for a moment, after a long time, he suddenly woke up and tried to stop Crest, while loudly Shouted: "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound just fell, he was bloody and pale in front of him, his face was warm and hot, and his taste was tangy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! Diana, the five-ring magician, screamed like a helpless little girl, and Collestel’s body without a head slammed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another..." Manuel thought quietly, "...in this case, should I go to the illusionist to be a psychological crisis?" Intervention..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "World Reality" channel ranked fifth in popularity is the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" - mental health lecture, and the first The question is the "Aline Weekly News Review." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resist the nausea and remove them with magic. Manuel carefully read the experimental record and then sighed long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Compliant with the light quantum hypothesis?" Diana is also a five-ring magician, the state of helplessness has not lasted for a long time, barely regained her ability to think and speak, a look of grief Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-level magician Manuel did not know what to use to nod his head: "Yes, it can be said that the optical quantum hypothesis has been confirmed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in line with his understanding of the slowly changing changes in the past three years. I should have been pleased to see this result, because it means that he may be promoted to the Eighth Ring in the next five years, but now The two headless bodies on the ground, the brain and blood everywhere, made him laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the teacher's last paper, do you want to publish it for him?" Diana is completely conscious of the flow of thought, and has no logical relationship with the previous question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel nodded: "It is said that the teacher’s experimental results confirm the optical quantum hypothesis and accept this hypothesis, but unfortunately encountered an accidental death, at least I can't let the teacher suffer damage after his death. After all, Lord Brooke is doing this experiment. We can't hide the result..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have anything to do with Brooke? Diana didn't ask how many arcane masters would believe in the cause of Roland's death, but asked Brooke in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel also became quite panicked: "We will return to Allinge immediately and send the results of the experiment to Lord Brooke, hoping that he has not yet begun. Experiment... If even he is fallen, things are terrible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we want to be teachers... Lucien Evans... Diana asked vaguely. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manuel showed a bitter smile: "If Cristall is still alive, he will definitely choose revenge, but he is the only one in the teacher’s descendants. Mostly taken care of. Although I personally have a heartfelt aversion to Lucien Evans because of this matter, I really want to say that this is his responsibility, and he can’t talk about it. It’s not his experimental design. It is not the experiment he completed. Maybe in the future I will oppose his theory or suggestion because of this feeling, but I can't do it directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most The important thing is that I have already shaken and persuaded the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Diana’s psychological activities are similar to those of Manuel, but there are many other considerations. Lucien is a Sixth-level Arcanist. The six-ring magician, rumored to be due to changes in the influence factor, his arcane score is close to nine thousand, or two years can become a seven-level arcane master, such a character is his own four-level arcane Can the division and the five-ring magician retaliate? And behind Lucien, there are high-level classmates such as Soups and Chloe, and they stand in the Arcane Storm to dominate you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know that Roland’s fallen Lucien is still in the game Black tea, enjoy the beauty of the spring morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s mental field touched, slowly turned to look at the laboratory door, and saw Sprint still remaining sturdy. Open the door and meditate and walk in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Splint, so early?" Lucien asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint was shocked, and he has become a second-circle magician who has no sense of the teacher’s existence, but he has not used any magician means. ! Is the teacher having an essential improvement in the magical power or the soul and cognitive world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I have been so early this time, I have to hurry and do my own experiments. The laboratory at home is not as good as the Atomic Research Institute." Sprint, who was dominated by the storm, refused to accept it, and he was afraid of his teacher, so he answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded lightly and left the window with a white glazed porcelain cup: "Because Jerome got the Holm crown award, so give You are stimulating? Well, it’s good to use a strong heart and pride in this aspect.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint doesn’t admit that the teacher is right, Looking around, I found a thick stack of papers on the experimental table: "Teacher, you have to submit a paper again? So many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
