			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three consecutive days of regular subject examinations, the weather was faintly gloomy, with light rain and cool to a little cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donny, how are you doing these days?" Sami, while waiting for the arrival of the magicians, asked about the arrival of the magicians. Downey, who was next to him, had completed the exam in advance a few days ago. Whether it was subjects such as magical tectonics and basic theories of arcane, or spelling tests, he could not stop him from returning to the bedroom to embrace sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at a statue of a half-length stone statue in the square - the best graduates of the Mills Noble School, trying to relax but still revealing a few nervous : "It's normal to play. I have exchanged answers with other people. I should be able to reach the standard of entering the Heidel School of Magic. Now look at the content of the dead spirit in this test. What about you?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, Sami’s spirit was not bad. He yawned and said: “At least there is no big loss. For me, this is enough.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t ask Downey’s exams, because in the “Natural Heart” school, even if it’s related to the theory and spells of the Necromancer, he They are more conscious than Donnie, just because of the ghost relationship behind them, they are better than Downey in casting speed, spell effect, more cast and special ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drizzle like a cow's hair fell on the apprentices in the square, but they didn't hide in the school building because they were broadcasted by the TV station. In the cognition of newspapers and smudges, the sorcerers of the Necromancers are relatively eccentric, or more sullen – whether it is the sacred medical field under the dead spirit, or the field of body structure research related to the dead, everything and life. The fields of dealing with things such as death, body, soul, etc. always give people a sense of mysterious and horrible but yearning for worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jane? Heinrich? Hunt, the countess, famous mathematician, astrologer..." Sami whispered in front of the bust The words, then laughed, "just mentioning mathematics, did not say the lady's arcane and magic level, it seems that her strength is not strong, and may not even exceed the middle, it should be a purely mathematical Women in the field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is strange, Mr. Langman became a formal magician the year before, but this does not hinder his mathematical theory in the last decade or so. The field ranks in the top 20, but he solves several mathematical problems raised by His Excellency," Downey said reverently. "Although Mr. Langman's magical talent is very general, he has made great contributions in the field of mathematics. He has obtained abundant resources, transformed himself step by step, made up for the gap, and our own talent is stronger than him. How can it be given up? This lady should be similar, and she looks like a a great aristocrat, the female of the Heinrich family ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami nodded slightly: "Well, let's say that with the development of 'artificial intelligence', it already has very terrible computing power, given A lot of magical talents are bad, but the chances of mathematical or theoretical arcane talents, through its assistance, their defects are most compensated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I also want to have an 'artificial intelligence', which can avoid a lot of tedious calculations..." Downey sighed and yearned, "Hey, Hunter's last name..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice suddenly turned a little higher: "I remember! This lady should be the wife of Mr. Ali Hunter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ali? Hunt, this is also a very inspirational name among ordinary people and magic apprentices. His same magical talent is not good, and the study of mathematical and theoretical arcane is not so outstanding. So far, it is only one. First-order Arcanist, Second Ring Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he first developed artificial intelligence, he gained the first pot of gold in his life with his keen intuition. Later, he got strong support from some werewolves. Became their spokesperson and extended their own small company to the fields of magic communicator, wired telephone, radio, satellite application, werewolf security, mercenary dispatch, etc., which belong to the forefront of the Holm Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most enviable thing is that he later married the Miss Jane of the Duke of Heinrich, and got rid of the image of the nouveau riche. The support of the nobility no longer relies solely on the werewolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply the most desirable template for life for ordinary people. The experience of Lord Evans is more exaggerated, more legendary, more eye-catching and worshipping. But it is too exaggerated, too legendary, too ridiculous! Anyone who hears it and measures himself a little can feel that he can never do it. On the contrary, Ali’s experience seems to rely more on the opportunities brought about by luck and the torrent of the times. It may not be the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, it turned out to be her. In fact, there are statues here. It won't go anywhere." Sami exclaimed with exaggeration, then he looked at the wall clock on the magical experiment tower and wondered. It’s almost eight o'clock, why don't you start?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie also feels weird, the high school of magic school uniform entrance exam is in Holm royal family, cabinet, magic parliament The "Arcane and Magic Education Committee" will pay close attention to the serious assessments carried out, and there should be no big accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there are more than a dozen gloomy magicians flying out of the teaching building. Some of them wear Holm style tight suits or long dresses, some Then drag a long classical magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally here." Donnie let out a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wizard who wore a long black dress had a small voice but screamed in everyone’s ear: "The last digit of the exam number is an even number followed by my left. The Master leaves, first test in the fields of soul, ghost, ghost, etc., oddly follow the mage on my right side, carry out the test of the body structure, the corpse combination, the awakening of the undead, etc., and change each other in the afternoon, don't think about it. Inquire about the content of the exam, because the content of the morning and afternoon is different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey took a shot of Sami's shoulder: "I am leaving first." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Sami's tail number is even, and his own is odd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will be successful!" Sami has always had a rare smile on his face, while his right hand clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey also smiled and waved his fist to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the first building, a magician continually leaves with apprentices of different tail numbers, so the flow of people is getting more and more sparse, to the end Downey even felt a long-lost silence, and seemed to be able to hear the birds in the shade singing cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he saw the front of a building that seemed to be a magic tower, surrounded by a group of people wearing dark black coats, they were blocked with alchemy barriers. All around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people at Gran Ling Street?" Downey’s heart beat faster, did something really happen? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grande Street is the headquarters of the Holm Imperial Police Department, which refers to the police in the general population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he saw two middle-aged men with black badges on their chests coming out of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Master of the Parliamentary Discipline Department? Actually dispatched them?" Downey's pupils contracted slightly, which is responsible for the internal division and investigation of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The necromancer in front of the with the apprentices leaned against, let the two disciplinary mage pass first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the cause of death is cardiac arrest, the deceased has a more serious heart problem..." A brown-haired disciplinary mage walks with his companion communicate with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion gently sighed: "It should be too irritating when playing virtual adventures. Illusion triggers a lot of hormone secretion, causing hidden heart problems in the dead." Suddenly, I can't think of the combination of artificial intelligence and illusion of Ms. Heidi, and it can still make people die. Hey, the Commission and the Magic Research Committee have an excuse to stop similar projects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what is the condition of your body is not clear, it is also alive to die..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the two disciplinary mage casual exchanges Downey's imagination came together: "The game based on 'artificial intelligence'? 'The voice of mystery' and TV shows have been mentioned, but actually can let a strong at least the official Master level die, it is really unexpected... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will there be any conspiracy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a familiar reading of many legends For those who love to explore adventure programs, Downey is the standard "conspiracy theory". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this little accident didn’t entangle Donnie for a long time, because the test of the Necromancer is about to begin, and everything else has to be thrown aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
