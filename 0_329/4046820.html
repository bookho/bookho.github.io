			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Ivan. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Church Pope Bilkovsky is slowly moving towards the prayer room. He is tall and bears his back, and is close to the thin old man of Pope Benedict III. Different, it is more like a knight who inspired the blood of the ice bear. In fact, he is indeed a second-level knight who has inspired his blood by himself. Even if he chooses the magical path, he will temper and maintain his body. It is also very important to note that after all, using "God" will also put a heavy burden on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out his right hand and slowly pressed on the door of the prayer room. His eyes were focused. No high-level person was always used to walking while thinking about the signs of the problem. In fact, when doing one thing, you must concentrate on doing it, not distracting from unnecessary thoughts, so that you can do your best, so when you eat, you should eat while you walk, when you think, when you think Thinking, the same is true for even the smallest details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his right hand, ready to push open the door of the prayer room, stopped on the handle of the copper, his eyes slightly picked up, and the surrounding light was invisible, like The enchantment of the entire cathedral is connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is nearby?" Although Berkovsky does not maintain the feeling of the entire St. Ivan, but the most basic warning is still there. If you don’t even know if a strong person enters the cathedral, then the pope of the Northern Church has failed too much. The most important thing is that the strong man just showed off. Now, as if to announce to him that he is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mysterious flash of the strong, Berkovsky is not afraid, more doubts, even if Pope Benedict III, even if it recovers "God descending", in St. Ivan, in the cathedral, I am not without the possibility of surviving, "God" plus the Northern Church has operated for hundreds of years of defensive core, enough to consume God's descending surgery itself Only minor injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like "the past pope" has never attempted to use the "God Drop" to bombard Allen, so that although it can destroy the city of the sky, it cannot Reinventing the legend inside, in the absence of others to cooperate with the siege, at least the legendary Douglas and Brooke are not worried about the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary volatility reappears and disappears quickly, but the position is no different from the previous one, which makes the preparation of the direct-to-be-beliek Bilkovsky A glimpse, smelled an unusual taste, and then the light behind him turned from a virtual to a solid, six-winged, closed-eyed angel figure, and then this figure flew into the void, disappeared into the other In front of Kirkovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the St. Ivan Cathedral, it is a vast square. It is in the same vein as the rough and heroic style advocated by the Shahran Empire, and in a small alley near the square, The darkness near the early morning is completely shrouded here, quietly and extraordinarily stunned, in stark contrast to the nearby sacred church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the alley, the light is prominent, the eyes of the closed eyes appear, and then twisted into the appearance of Berkovsky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." The darkness of the alley suddenly sounded a creepy laughter, not like a human mouth. It is closer to "桀桀" The feeling, but also brought a strong sense of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many strong people who can fear Bilkovsky, except for the gods, that is, Douglas, so he is a ghost who is a mysterious horror. The sneaky person is not a bit polite: "If the reason you cited me is not good enough, then go to hell and think of a better reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿· ······································································································ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkovsky carefully discerned, but found that this mysterious bird disguised its breath very well, so that the projected one could not see through it. Unless the ontology is here and used, then the little bird will probably collapse on the spot and leave no clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can call me 'reporting dead birds,' but this is a good news." This little bird is like stepping on a branch. Strangely paused in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkovsky snorted without hesitation: "Good news? There is not much good news that will make me happy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Berkovsky's pupil contracted, his eyes fixed, and he looked at the weird bird intently. The first time he met, he carefully looked at it, as if the breath that did not exist became heavy. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent and looked at the "Reporting Dead Birds": "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last one or two years, there have been many mysterious and strange events in the northern church ruling area. The results of the final investigation all pointed to the ancient devils, and Berkovsky received a lot from the Dark Parliament, the Endless Seas and other places. Intelligence, almost guessed that someone is collecting emotions and trying to turn into an ancient devil state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Magic Council broadcast clearly mentions that the transformation into the ancient devil state is the method that Tanos created, and he used this and the power of faith to successfully promote the gods. Although Berkovsky did not fully believe in the broadcast of this bright and honest broadcast, but also had a preliminary inference, the reason why the Pope and the saints could not find the door of the gods, only know how to pass on power and steal The use of the power of faith was originally due to the lack of a key link. Therefore, he had a heartfelt heart for the method of "reporting dead birds." !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't know that Wicken secretly announced the law of the gods?" "Reporting the dead bird" tone slightly sarcastically said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Berkovsky repeated the previous words again. The number of surprises he is today is probably worth many years, not enough for him. Calm, not enough attention, but the news of "reporting dead birds" is too shocking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dead Bird" made a stunned laughter: "The Elf Queen knows, so Lanhill is missing, the Dark Lord knows, so the former demon prince fell In the past, in the past, except for the big war, the legend of a few fallen legends has disappeared. You are not aware of something wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that...···· "Berkovsky is not blindly convinced of the "reporting of dead birds", but has long been skeptical about these events, and can be inferred from the faint facts of obtaining confidential information, and today, this fact is complete. The appearance appeared in front of him and confirmed each other. "What benefits can Viken do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the point he most can't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benefits, it’s not good to let the enemy kill each other? Isn’t it good to stabilize the internal situation? It’s not good to delay the time to recover. And they are also Ken's experimental items, their experience and experience can help Vicken find the problem of his own method, find a solution to the hidden danger, let the peek of the true God level, anyway, he is a kind of god, and then can save life, and then there will be The chance to come back again.” “Reporting the Dead Bird” laughed. “Moreover, the choice is that there is no source of solid belief, and it is impossible to rush into the legend of the god-like level for a long time.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No wonder there is no hidden danger to us..." Berkovsky nodded lightly. He was the Pope of the Northern Church and had a solid source of faith and long-term stealing. The law can be greatly improved in a short period of time, and the Northern Church and the Southern Church itself belong to this relationship. It is the easiest to seize the other's beliefs. Viken will not be able to "before the brain is broken." Self" Disclosed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set his mood and said straightforwardly: "What do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the big guys, the decision-making ability at the crucial moment is indispensable. Therefore, there is no such thing as the core of the problem, and he is not worried that the "reported dead bird" will take a fake to lie to himself. The exchange of dare to find someone "notarization" is definitely a part of each other's exchange of their own knowledge, can not judge the true and false, cancel the transaction at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only have a way to transform the state without the means of stealing and using the power of faith, and there is no such thing as a combination of the secrets of the shocking god, and I know that you have From the realm of the dead, we got the means to steal and use the power of faith, and after the improvement of the previous pope, we exchanged each other." The "bird of death" converges, hoarse and low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkovsky looks at him and knows the secrets of the Pope? Who is he? What did Viken tell him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence doubts, Berkovsky "slightly disappointed" authentic: "Not complete?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is your last chance. Other people will not disclose it. No one wants to increase their competitors. If you don't exchange, I can find your saints, I think they It should not be rejected." "Reporting dead birds" Two pale, empty eyes seem to have passed a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
