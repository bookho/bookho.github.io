			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This news, I believe that the degree of attention paid by the Arcane Master is far better than the Holm Crown Award on Monday. Since the Speaker of Light's speed of light experiment is powerful Questioning the existence of 'Ether', the wave-particle debate broke out again, and was pushed to a new peak by Mr. Evans's light quantum hypothesis. It has passed three years and still failed to calm down, becoming the third in the history of magic. The second wave war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recalling the previous two 'wars', the volatility led by Lord Brooke is already close to completely defeating the particle theory, leaving the last stubborn The person can only comfort himself with the weak reason that 'Ether' failed to confirm existence, lest the cognitive world collapse, but the particle theory suddenly took the light speed experiment and the light quantum hypothesis 'resurrection of the dead', and launched a new round of volatility. Attacks, speed of light experiments, and photoelectric effects have become the mountains in the hearts of supporters of every wave, but they have never found a theory to explain these two phenomena."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple introduction of "Lark" outlines the contours of the wave war, let the young magician Black boil, clench his fists, and want to knock down a few of the stubborn and wicked guys to the ground, while He faintly heard from the open window that other magicians in the division were cursing loudly. There is no doubt that there is not a handful of particle theory supporters here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After three years of brewing, the wave war seems to have reached a stage where it can determine the outcome. Both Brooke and Roland completed the magical array improvement. The basis for conducting accurate photoelectric effect experiments, if the experimental data and images can strongly prove the error of the optical quantum hypothesis, then the particle theory will return to the past half-dead state, relying on the speed of light experiment to delay the remnant."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will be a historic event of the parliament, an event that marks the future direction and the real world. Therefore, we randomly invited a few arcans to ask their views and look at the parliament. What is the internal view of this matter." The "Lark" crisp but passionate and infectious voice seems to be able to penetrate everyone's heart. "Hello, I am the "Aline Weekly News Review" The anchor of the Lark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Miss Lark, you are as beautiful as your voice." A clear male voice did not answer nervously, like With a bit of joy and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other male surnames are a bit cringe and say hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Miss Lark, I really like listening to your "Aline Weekly News Review", you are more beautiful than we think." The female surname of the Arcanist voice responded softly on behalf of several companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lark" He smiled and said: "Thank you for your kindness. Today, please come and ask for one thing. I don't know if you are Mr. Brooke, Mr. Roland. What do you think about the upcoming quantum quantum experiment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, this is what we have been waiting for for a long time, starting with the Evans committee throwing the quantum hypothesis, we Just waiting, waiting for someone to stand up and confirm the mistake of this hypothesis. Our own strength has not yet reached the high level, the improvement of the magic array is still at the stage of exploration, so we can only wait, three years have passed, finally let We waited until this day, and we can rebut this day of ridiculous assumptions. I believe that Mr. Brooke and Mr. Roland can give convincing experimental results." The clear male voice talked eloquently, and the eloquence seemed quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very nice to see Lord Brooke completing the magical array improvement, I’ve had enough of the group of particle theory guys.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results of the experiment will prove that the fluctuations are correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several male surnames have also answered one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I personally admire Evans, I admire his many Arcane achievements, and worship him to receive the highest honors in four different fields before he raises the ranks. He is the first in the history of the parliament. He worshipped him as a high-ranking magician when he was less than twenty-five years old. But I also think that the light quantum hypothesis is correct. Evans also makes mistakes. Well, he is more like a flesh and blood. It is more close to people..." The soft beauty seems to want to go down, but was interrupted by the companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the answer, the Lark has some doubts and a little smile: "It seems that no one believes that the experimental results will benefit the quantum hypothesis? The dominance of the wave theory Really so unshakable? For three years, there is still no other theory that can explain the photoelectric effect. All the inaccurate experiments during the period are in perfect accordance with the light quantum hypothesis of the Evans committee. Even a phenomenon he predicted has been confirmed. Is it really so sure that the experimental results will prove the error of the optical quantum hypothesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is inevitable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No doubt.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearly ten Arcans who were interviewed all answered affirmatively, but their voices seemed to reveal a slight weakness and lack of self-confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black's clenched fists are loose, and every time it feels like a wave of deep blue pupils, it reveals deep doubts and lack of self-confidence. For three years, there are still no other theories that can explain the photoelectric effect. All the experimental results prove the correctness of the optical quantum hypothesis. Similarly, several theories that attempt to explain the experiment of the speed of light are falsified one by one, and the existence of the ether is at stake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the fluctuations be correct? Can this experimental result prove the pseudo-light quantum hypothesis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current sound of "Zi" sounds, a skin is slightly dry and wrinkled The hand fell on the button and gently turned off the alchemy radio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Barrek saw the teacher Brooke looking back at the window, looking at the magnetic field of his electromagnetic kingdom, beating the arc, condescending as everything The master, then carefully took a breath: "Teacher, the previous "Aline Weekly News Review" you listened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, very good In the form of the show, Evans can make amazing results in any field." Brooke wearing a wig hairpin gently daggers, like an elegant and conservative old gentleman, "just his humor and him Words created, sometimes I am not too adapted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either Allinge, Rantart, Cox, or the Soral Islands, the more The more young magicians use the novel words created by Evans. This seems to form a trend. Whoever does not use it means backward and conservative.” Barrek said with a faint smile, then the expression became dignified. Some of the branches are authentic: "Teacher, you should have listened to the interview hosted by the Lark. ? "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? Well, "Brooke looked back at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barek has the courage to say: "I am a little worried about the results of the experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Say the point." Brooke said calmly, on the arcane issue, he does not like to circle, nor like a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barek closed his mouth: "I have done several experiments before, and the results are biased towards the optical quantum hypothesis. It seems that only it can explain the photoelectric effect, accurate experiment. As a result, I am worried that it will not be conducive to fluctuations. I hope that before you conduct the experiment, you should not hold a firm idea. The fluctuations are not without a retreat. We still have diffraction images. We have a whole set of theory..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooks gold-rimmed glasses behind a pair of green and deep eyes focused on Barrek, after a while, when Barek was sweating, he regained his gaze. Looking out the window, it seems that Aringe, who saw the main material world through the half-plane, saw the dark night in the early spring, and whispered aloud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s going to rain...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge headquarters, special Out of the 31st floor area used by Sky Radio Station<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery" Voice over much off than the "real world" early, so the entire floor, empty, almost no one could come, tread footsteps in the corridor, resulting in crisp echo, cold lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organize the things and take a quota of potions to protect the scorpion, "Lark" Samantha walked out of the lounge in a brisk pace, ready to return home . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she just went out, she saw a long black-breasted dress, and the gentle and handsome Lucien was greeting other arcane masters of the world’s real channel. Consoling their hard work, they kept a serious and indifferent expression and curiously asked with a crisp voice: "Evans, how are you still in the magic tower at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
