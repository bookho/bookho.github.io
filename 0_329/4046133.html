It is not based on strong vitality and resilience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its sword has a special ability, as long as it is hit by it, it will fall into a state of continuous massive bloodshed and loss of vitality, even if it self-heal Strong ability cannot be avoided unless it is a liquid, elemental or spiritual creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the face of the Todd transparent metal mask quickly turned into a silvery white, sparkling icy sharp metal color, like a real steel magic image! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This not only weakens a large part of the slash and magic X magical damage, but also allows the power to improve again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s indifferent silver-gray eyes didn’t look at Todd’s eyes, and the pupil’s figure reflected in the pupil, carrying the “slaughter” ride The gun continued to charge him forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her left hand pulling out the rifle from the abdomen, she once again held the silver-white electric snake’s shining "Thunder" sword, completely without the blood flowing, it seems that at any time Can slash up and resist Todd's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Natasha did not really slash the sword, reducing the power of the charge, because she is completely convinced that the knights who follow their own charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan’s body bursts with milky white light, and there are four pairs of white light wings behind it, which makes his body suddenly double, like a giant His own hands and giant swords squatted, and they screamed on Todd's bloody sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power Angel" bloodline! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not only to become a knight, you can cast some angelic magical powers, and the strength of Wyan can be compared to Natasha, Verdi, etc. The sixth-level grand knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two big swords collided, provoked violent shocks and squalls, and the iron gloves that clasped the hilts of the two men appeared in countless smalls in the rapid tremors. crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the four pairs of angels behind Wyan have fallen off many feathers of light, and Todd’s steel-like hard-faced face has not changed, obviously his Strength has the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wynn did not retreat, and the legs caught the dragon scale horse to let it follow Natasha, and the two-handed sword kept slashing and slamming. Todd will try to stop Natasha's offense from being blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gloves are broken, the hands are split, the blood is flowing, the angel wings are getting scarce and faint, and Wyan can only hold on to the teeth, holding Natasha to the side, and then There is no way to resist other knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yavi...", after a brief and rushing cry, the sound of heavy objects falling to the ground, Bocht did not have a clip under the back and left How long can you support? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after he swayed on the ground, the rest of the knights were busy blocking Natasha and others, and did not take care of his life. After taking Natasha and cleaning up the battlefield, it’s not too late. L<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s strong balance, calm and focused characteristics when he ran wildly. And the instincts of "vigilance" blessings and the "ice and avenge" brought the will, not being scared by the scene of this charge and fierce melee, constantly twisting and waving the sword to help Yaka to resist attacks that he could not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the long swords of the Dangdang came in succession, Lucien was paralyzed from the palm to the arm, and must be clenched in both hands to make the sword not fly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of strength, Lucien is not a small gap between the quasi-chief and the official knight, even if the enemy knight does not use strength as a specialty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another slammed from behind, Lucy's body, the star shield can no longer support, and directly collapsed into pieces of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the movement, the round shield of the cockroach reappears. But it has just condensed, and there is a big blow behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the star shield suddenly faded. If you don't walk, Sean has a very fast forward speed, which offsets part of the power. The star shield is likely to be close to breaking, and Lucien, who is still in the caster buffer, can't cast spells so fast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is definitely a second-level knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a regular knight, Lucy Even if you stand still, the star shield can withstand the 3rd and 4th. Before the mental energy is consumed, you can completely keep the shield on your body, unless the knight's blood power has a unique place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the performances of a magician who is stronger than a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Verdi saw that Natasha had already rushed to the front of her for a few meters, and the long black gun tip shone with the bloodthirsty and indifferent light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sides are a small number of knights who protect Silvia, and behind it are only the ridiculous wilderness and the very close Melz Black Forest. As soon as he opened him, Natasha could break out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Nata Li escapes into the Black Forest, it will be very difficult to chase in complex terrain."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Natasha is still alive, I will definitely be executed by the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as Natasha is blocked for three or four seconds My knights will all be surrounded, she can't escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear cousin, let me see if you can take a few seconds I will kill me in the face! Break the shield of truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Verdi is wide enough, but does not prevent him from having strong will and bravery The style, without the iron black shield, he inserted the sword, his hands crossed in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth swayed violently, the black soil slammed high, and a thick layer of walls was erected in front of Verdi. At the same time, only a few stars in the sky bloomed brightly, letting Verdi shine light white, and gathered a transparent and solid force field shield in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shield of Truth is a blood that combines the power of the Earth and the Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Verdi didn't have the superb shield, he took the power of his blood to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Slaughter" black spurs on the "Shield of the Earth", the first few layers are silent and disappear, the latter layers collapse, but they also It consumes the power of the Natasha charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the gun is immersed in the transparent force wall of the condensate, and the ripples of the road spread toward it around the center, but Verdi only retreated. In one step, the "Shield of Truth" will be stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second, two seconds, the tip of the gun is only a few centimeters deep! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildi saw that the other great knights had already arrived at speed, and wielding a giant sword would cut to Natasha, and suddenly he sneered: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear cousin, you have not realized that you have been moving forward and killing all the obstacles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Victory is about to belong to........."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a white pillar of light descended from the sky and struck heavily on Verdi's shield of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glow of the glow is like the wrath of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light strike!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this level of magic does not weaken the truth Shield's defense, but Verdi was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
