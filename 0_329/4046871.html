			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Heidi and others’ stunned eyes, Lucian said with a smile: “I like to listen to music and write music in my free time, Mr. Oliver likes it. Watching drama and creating drama, this is no different from playing games. It is a kind of relaxation. As long as you don't indulge in it and interfere with the research of your own arcane and the improvement of magical power, there is no problem."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the teacher’s words, Heidi and others finally completely let go of his heart. He really does not blame himself and others for making a small game when studying "artificial intelligence". As he himself said, if he is addicted to music, there will be no breakthroughs in arcane and magic for a long time, and he will also be secretly ridiculed by the arcaneists to distinguish between the primary and secondary, being harmed by music, but the teacher is very clear. My own goals and directions have always regarded music as a measure of life. Therefore, when the Arcanists mentioned him, they would sincerely praise him as a great musician. As long as they can control themselves, they can’t play games. Can't be a beautiful talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is good or bad, largely determined by its own attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and others are not afraid and afraid of teacher scolding, but Lucian’s criticism is often accompanied by a large number of “jobs”, such as quantum field theory. Learning, such as the practice of new achievements in the current mathematical field, and this is a "nightmare" that they can never forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you can rest assured that we are mainly trying to test some of the modules to design this box game, not to be addicted." Heidi represents the members of his group Sean is doing a guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the square game on the water screen display, and felt a lot in his heart. Although it is still very simple, it basically has the prototype of the game that you are familiar with: "Just call it 'Aringe box', in fact, designing the game is also a very good thing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? This time, even the shy and introverted guy of Annick expressed surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician has to have leisure and entertainment. I don’t think the number of regular entertainment methods for opera, drama, concerts, dances, and mystery. Is it too little?” Lucien is half-jokingly joked. As for the activities that the nobles like to hunt, they are not very popular with the magicians. “And this can also promote the positive image of the arcian and the magician. Think about it, If you have a game that simulates adventure, let ordinary people play the magician and feel the magic of dealing with monsters and everyday applications. They will definitely be more and more yearning for magic."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi listened to his eyes and looked like it was very interesting, but she immediately frowned and said: "Don’t say if ordinary people can afford it, now the 'artificial intelligence' There is no way to run such a complicated game, and we still have a lot of research projects and no time to design more games. We have to continue the research on magical crystallography, we must start the integration of 'alcheming life' and 'artificial intelligence' Try..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not for you to design. There are at least a hundred of the arcane masters who follow your research on 'artificial intelligence', with your Apprentices and alchemists are more, they can play their role, and the process of designing the game can be completely separated from the magic, just like writing 'drama' with a simple 'artificial intelligence language', so that this can be Outsourcing to ordinary people who don't have any magical talents is a new job for the kingdom." Lucien offered his own advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outsourcing?" Heidi first heard the noun, but did not prevent her from understanding the meaning of Lucien. Anyway, the teacher is notorious for tying up words and sentences. This has become a popular way for parliament. "There are some simple modules that can be outsourced, but they have to be specially set up... but the most important thing is to upgrade artificial intelligence. 'The performance.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the game, she suddenly remembered one thing, wondering and curiously asked: "Teacher, large live screen can be produced half a year ago. But why is the 'Mystery Voice' not yet starting to 'live'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to their previous "artificial intelligence" research, the screen for displaying images is not How long it took to make a breakthrough, although it took a lot of work to reduce costs, maintain color, and reduce size in the later period. Until now, there is no finished product suitable for promotion to aristocratic families, but large-scale live screens have already begun to be produced. The squares of the important cities of the Straits and the North Coastal Corridor - there are not many places to be arranged, the Magic Council and the Union of Freedoms and the Free City Alliance can barely bear, and this also gives Heidi It provides a rich patent income. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these newcomers, there are even ordinary people without magical talents. They are people who are smart, active, and novel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and others can understand the teacher's meaning and nod their heads and sigh: "I don't know when I can see the first live broadcast in the real sense..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it will take a long time..." Lucien said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the beginning of the month of the Blazing Moon (August) On the town square of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white water column spurts directly into the sky from a stone-shaped pool, then cascades down in all directions, splashing waves on the clear water The sound is loud and loud but it doesn't make the nearby people feel uncomfortable. Instead, they are so close that they want to dispel the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the famous fountain is a strange huge "glass" screen that looks translucent and faintly sees the many complex components and Complex mysterious pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said why this live screen has been established for five months, but there has been no 'live event'?" A citizen asked his child Langman . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Langman’s body has been raised a lot. He is a fourth-grade student of the first general school. He is already a learned scholar in the eyes of neighbors and friends. I know a lot of knowledge. Although there is no outstanding magical talent, I was praised by the teacher as a mathematical talent. This makes Langman’s father and mother very proud. I don’t consciously regard my child as a scholar. Any questions are subconsciously asked. he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Live' is not an event, it should be something like 'Sound of Mystery' in the future..." Langman followed what he heard at school Interpretation in a halfword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the huge "glass" screen suddenly glowed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s glowing, it’s shining, other book friends are watching:!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How is there no notice on 'Sound of Mystery?’”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are picking up and there is a lot of excitement in doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Langman and his father and mother also ended the discussion, and their eyes were completely projected onto the "screen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the live show? Really looking forward to it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the development of arcane and magic brought about great changes in society, the citizens of Rentat often spend every day in shock and surprise, so this is The abrupt broadcast was full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is gradually stable, and there are two sitting figures on the "glass" screen, one male and one female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women’s long-haired shawl, wearing a long dress like an evening dress, faintly allows the citizens who were impressed with the last live broadcast to recognize this as the “nightingale” The man is a typical Holm, with dark blue eyes and deep eye sockets. He has two mature mustaches and a fitted tuxedo, dressed as if to go to the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello everyone, I am your old friend 'nightingale', this is a live experiment, so I didn’t inform everyone in the Voice of Mystery, and Now, I can see that I will witness the first live broadcast of the 'Aringe' satellite TV station.” Louise was too nervous to temporarily impose a 'mechanized mind' on herself, but smiled sweetly but did not really smile. The one next to me is also an old friend of all of you. He often presides over the call of the 'Human and Nature' program, Mr. Karon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People and Nature?" Lang Man and other citizens looked at the screen with enthusiasm, but did not understand why Mr. Karon, who was the host of the "People and Nature" program, partnered with Miss Nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caron smiled and said: "I am a little nervous, I can't say anything, so we start today's 'people and nature'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
