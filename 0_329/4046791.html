			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the Hall of St. Ann's is still so luxurious and magnificent, and it is very different from the architecture of Rentaite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the foyer, the waiter is welcoming a nobleman, musician and musician who came to the concert to see the beginning of the concert gradually approaching, from far The carriage that came at the door gradually became scarce, and he seemed to relax a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary citizens like him, being a waiter in the Hall of the Holy Grail is a very rare opportunity. If you perform well, it is easy to be a nobleman or Musicians valued and got a better job, and because of this, when faced with these guests, he was careful and did not dare to go out of the air, for fear of making mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The concert is about to begin..." He saw the young musicians who came out in the small hall to welcome the audience while finishing the bow tie while walking in the background Going, suddenly more relaxed, this is from the subconscious reaction that often participates in this occasion. "The weekly sacred hall concert is really full of scenes, and there are few empty seats. It is the highest hall of music. However, if you want to have the madness of the city seven or eight years ago, you don’t know how many years you still need to wait..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seven or eight years Before, he was only a 13-year-old boy, and such a scene left him with an indelible impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the capital of other countries is so crazy about music, Bog is always mysterious to say that this is because Aalto entertainment is too Less reason... What kind of entertainment can we have for ordinary civilians like us?” The waiter saw the concert coming soon, and his thoughts diverged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, the crisp sound pulled him back from his own world, and a horse tied with a bell dragged a pumpkin carriage to the front of the foyer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The carriage made by the pumpkin..." The waiter thought it should be very strange and very strange, but why do you think it is normal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no time to think about it, saw a gentleman in a tuxedo walking down the pumpkin carriage, and then extended his right hand to make a lady in a purple court dress. Hold it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms., are you coming to the concert of Mr. Francisco?" the waiter asked respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, take us in, give us two positions." Lucien said in a normal tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter quickly turned around and led the two to go to the hall and faintly felt that they had forgotten something important, such as their tickets? For example, the Hall of the Holy Ghost has never added a position? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is the pumpkin carriage?" Natasha was funny and curious about the short road she had just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s right index finger flexed and knocked on his chin: “Do you think this is a fairy tale?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he shifted the subject and looked at the ring of the holy hall, and sighed softly: "Actually, I am more familiar with the stage above than the audience below." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I have no experience in performing in the Hall of the Holy Grail." Natasha said without regret <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mainly her identity restriction at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter didn’t know where to find the two reclining chairs and placed them on the edge of the last row, where the musicians turned a blind eye to it as if this was taken for granted. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucine and Natasha sat down, the concert officially began, and today’s musician Francisco went to wear a black tuxedo. At the front desk, first salute the box and then salute the audience below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His high nose and thin lips, slightly higher cheekbones, with a typical sacred Heerzian style, is a young musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to listen to that box...Hey, Mr. Victor Othello, Franz..." Natasha I looked at the box and read the acquaintances that Lucien knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't have the idea to meet them, which would upset their quiet and normal life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francisco raised the batons Lussien and Natasha were quiet, listening to his music carefully, according to the track list, this is a The symphony called "Growth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music begins with the tone of the question, as if seeking the meaning of life. Then, on this theme, the melody changes slightly, showing a picture of youth. Full of vitality, then the melody changes again, warm, sweet love infiltrates into the hearts of every listener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melody, every listener seems to have re-examined his childhood, youth and first love, which is more and more sorrow can not cover up the bright, but The melody has a deformation, the various instruments become rushed and fierce, the drums roar, the stringed instruments are sharp, and the brass pipes roar, creating a scene of lightning, thunder and storm, which is as difficult to avoid in the course of life. The difficulties and frustrations make people feel nervous, painful and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after the storm, the sky is more blue, and the sun becomes more and more charming. It shows that the suffering of the world will eventually pass, and the life that has suffered through hardships is more rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melodious "muddy" sounded, this bleak life reached its utmost, and music quickly became a march of battle, indicating the coming of the next challenge. But full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good music, but it seems to be very different from the normal symphony." After the music ended, Natasha had a question while applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled, and Aalto’s symphony developed this branch: “The symphony of a single movement, more like a poem, a complete symphony Pay attention to the structural form, and its structure is more free, focusing on the thoughts and contents of the body...····<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former musician hears the back The discussion between the two couldn't help but show off the impulse to show off: "You don't know the symphonic poems created by Mr. Francisco, are you coming back from the field? This is the most popular music topic in Aalto recently."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha looked at each other and were busy with the study of arcane and magic. They were dealing with the major events of the Parliament and the Atomic Research Institute. She was immersed in On the temperament of his own knight's strength, he has to deal with the affairs of the kingdom. Although he also pays attention to the development of Aalto's music, it is also the kind of person who only knows once in a month, and naturally does not know the hottest topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musician finished and appreciated the authenticity: "But even if you don't understand the symphonic poems, you don't know the characteristics of it, no. Like someone who just heard, this shows that you have extraordinary musical attainments. Do you know if it is a musician from other countries?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't join any musicians The association only has a lot of research on music.” Lucien answered half-fuzzyly, “Dead” will automatically disqualify members of the Aalto Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musician did not ask, but the break between the two works introduced the symphonic poems to the two men. Francisco: "... He is a musician from the sacred Heerz Empire. He studied with Master Christopher for two years. He is famous for his bold innovation and passionate piano performance. This "Growth" symphony is his famous work... ···”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after the death of Silvia, Master Christopher had the idea of ​​re-training a student, Lucien And Natasha is very pleased with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...··· His musical talent is very outstanding. You should have heard the symphonic poems just now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Enough to be a classic! After the death of Evans Master, people from other countries thought that Aalto’s concerts were gradually declining. Now they should understand their mistakes! Aalto’s music is the whole city that has been passed down from generation to generation. The atmosphere is there, there is a precious legacy left by a master, there will always be new outstanding musicians to grow up, Mr. Francisco is proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The musician probably got a similar stimuli and was very excited. He looked at Lucien and Natasha with gaze, hoping for their approval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled, solemn and leisurely: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
