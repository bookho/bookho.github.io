			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas Magic School, Jerome's Garden Villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you are also called Lucien? Evans?" A black-haired, messy young man with a smile in his tone, casually outside his white shirt Wearing a black vest, no long dress or suit, "K always said that his name is very common, I always don't believe it, I can't think of it, even a school can meet. Well, I admit what Tom Ah, Jack, etc. are very common. There are five pairs of names in the school!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the second ring magician introduced by Lazar Ke, good at elemental magic and mathematical basis, is said to be jumping off, active, and joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Lucien answered, Rock said indefinitely: "I will introduce you to K, and the same name is the same name! Lucien, You can rest assured that K is a very good person. Although he is silent and introverted, he is diligent and talented, and he is willing to help others. If he asks questions, he will try his best to give answers, unlike some The guy in the electromagnetic faction, the look of the eyes on the top of the head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the previous issue of the "Arcane" journal, Mr. Brooke confirmed with magic experiments After light is a special kind of electromagnetic wave, they call it spiritual power is also a kind of wave. Every day, people laugh at us who insist on spiritual particle theory. I don’t want to think about it. There are still several magic experiments that cannot be explained by waves. Your speaker has not responded yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien glanced at Lazar very funnyly, thinking he was a lot of words, comparable to Luo Ke, the gap is too far, but from Rock’s words, Lucien also grasped Magic parliamentary latest research trends, it has been smiles and listened politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Lazar is helpless: "Rock is like this. Hey, since the last issue of the Arcane Journal, I am a magician running around. I don't think that the magician who insisted on 'Psychology Particle Theory', who lives in Aringe for a long time, has already felt great pressure. Well, although I also like the spirit is the concept of particles, the light is electromagnetic waves. Proof makes me sad, but the blow to the church is to destroy the surname, and their theory of 'light is created by God' is completely shattered. I am very happy when I think of this, I feel very proud and proud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome, who is better at the stars, and his beautiful wife, Vera, did not interject, always smiling and listening to the complaints of Rock and Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element of the element and the elemental magician who established the atomic concept seems to be naturally a supporter of the "spiritual particle theory", if it is not under the pressure of the church, it looks Rock wants to fight with those electromagnetic magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the discussion between the two of them stopped, Lucien and Jerome were already sitting on the couch, leisurely drinking the Earl Grey tea that Vera had soaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much brown hair, ordinary looks, slightly fattened Jerome, but the whole person naturally exudes a happy atmosphere, and his wife Vera It is a beautiful girl with red hair, about twenty-three or four years old, quiet and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, you drink black tea first, I go to the kitchen to prepare dinner for you." Vera left politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This caused Rock’s emotion: "Why Jerome, you can find a good girl like Vera, and the girls around me don’t know how." "A good lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Jerome smiled and smiled a little shyly, without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar did not want to raise such a "sad" topic, so he moved to Rock: "Roque, what about the magic research project you are going to apply for?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What project?" Lucian asked very cooperatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Rock answered with dismay: "Don't mention it, it has been rejected. The reason for the refusal is actually 'Mr., please don't make a joke.'"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said with a little excitement: "Lu Xien, this is a very good project. As a high tower scholar, I always think that everything can use numbers. To express, such as the power of magic, the degree of defense and weakening, and the lack of standardization is now a problem. We need to measure the data of different magicians to release magic, organize them into different forms, and if there is a disputed magician If you want to fight, compare the data of each magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of reaction, Lucien will certainly not be politely expressed, but casually perfunctory: "If the two magicians have strong magic, some magic is weak?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Rocke was very interested to start with a stack of white papers on the side of the table. "My total mental strength is 105, Lazar's 96..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of figures were reported, which led to Lazar's dissatisfaction: "How is my low." Then the two began to argue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerum reluctantly smiled at Lucien: "They are like this, they love to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So they are good friends." Lucien thought of Lazard's use of "below" Rock's words, and now it seems that he is also suitable for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucian and Jerome ignored Lazar and Rocky to discuss the topic of astrology and elements, two of them a deep horror of knowledge, an actual More use, talk very happy, I have a feeling of wanting to know earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, a few gentlemen, please have dinner." Vera walked in, behind the maid pushing the dining car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Jerome put down the white glazed cup with black tea and turned to see Lazar and Rock are very engaged in "cards" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I use ‘magic missiles’, the power is 5.” Roque threw a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar’s face is seriously taken out of his hand: “Yangyan bodyguard, defensive power 7.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Mr., what are you doing?" Jerome awoke them a little curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock frowned and thought for a moment: "I admit that this is a failed magic research project." Then he smiled brightly, "but it is a lot of fun." The card game! Hey, I have to prepare a sieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was dumb, and Roque was thinking strangely and jumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I smelled the smell of steak and grilled fish, Vera, you are such a good girl." Rock started with an unimaginable jumping speed. Another topic, "How can you see Jerome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vila quietly smiled: "I think Jerome is focused on seriousness. It looks very charming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really embarrassing. How can I not!" Rock and Lazar patted their faces Lucien is also envious of the love of their couple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dinner of the host, Lucien and Roque sent Lazar and walked back to the garden where the two lived in the grotesque garden of the magic garden. villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic school, except for the married teacher Jerome, only the second-level arcanes are qualified to live in a garden villa, after all, the teacher A large number of people. So before leaving Lazar, Rock negotiated with the magician and exchanged to live with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien originally wanted to go to the lab tonight to use a mixture of other materials to refine a "hard rock" that helps the mentally stable drug. I broke through to the second level, but the busy day made him a little tired, and felt that the state is not suitable for refining pharmaceutical agents, so I am going to finish the course after the afternoon of the next afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The next day, the "thorn tree" class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher of today's 'Ancient Magic Language' class was replaced by Mr. Evans!" Heidi looked at Reyaliya and Annick mysteriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick is very puzzled: "Mr. K? He is a second-level arcian, a second-circle magician, shouldn’t he only teach high-level apprentices? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, I heard about it from squad leader Grant." Heidi shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, other apprentices in the 'Thorn Tree' class are also discussing each other, even on the table, not loving and other strange apprentices. The exchange of Sprint also sat up, and the name evoked his memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
