			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the words of the little old man, Lucien was secretly confessed: "The words of the compliments are reluctant..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, however, Lucien is modest and courteous: "Yes, sir, I still have a lot to improve and learn." The perverted old man can sit next to Lord Hathaway, at least It is also a legendary magician, and it is always true that he is following him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon, who led Lucien, smiled at this time: "Evans, this is the great Arcanist Hathaway." He pointed The beautiful and beautiful lady introduced, it really is the "element dominator" of Lucian's conjecture. The Holm royal family is directly bloody. Natasha does not know the "ancestors" before generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mystery is on, your glory shines on the entire world of elements." Lucien holds the chest with his left hand and holds his forehead with his right hand, using the official magic parliament Saying hello to Hathaway, I don’t know why I suddenly feel a little uneasy, and I have a feeling of seeing my elders. For every legendary magician, according to the long tradition, there is a unique tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri’s expression nodded coldly: “The path of mystery and truth cannot be slackened.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is less than words, and her words are concise. It seems to be a straightforward truth, and it seems to be mentioning Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hathaway finished, Gaston turned to the little old man in bright red robes, and he was not aware of it under the smile on his face. A little fear, it seems that I am afraid of saying something wrong and ushered in unrelenting criticism and accusation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, this is the great Arcanist Fernando Barista." After a few discretion, Gaston still uses the simplest and simplest words. Introduction, without adding any modifications and remaining words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominates? The abnormal old man is dominated by the storm? Lucien was quite surprised. According to the rumors he heard, the storm should be dominated by an old-fashioned, unreasonable, unfair authority, and a violent arcane master who faced zero tolerance and was like his legendary title. This short and clear, faintly can be seen that the handsome old man in his youth is really not like, and his original humor has also left a deep impression on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s impossible to think that Gaston could deceive himself with this kind of thing, unless he wants to be drowned by the real storm to dominate the roar of the wind and the waves, so Lucy Once again, solemnly salute: "Mystery is on, you are a storm, lightning, and the master of the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ceremony, Lucien also became Be careful, the words are a bit of a word, a little afraid of which one of your actions, which word is wrong and is roaring, Mr. Raven's roar and the storm dominated certainly not in the same series. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be so careful, except for arcane and magical mistakes, I rarely argue because of other things, such as Oliver's discussion of oil painting and drama, I Never interrupted." Fernando sneered and defended himself, letting Lucien relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people’s expressions don’t think so, and Florensa said to Lucien with a mouth shape, “That’s because he doesn’t understand at all.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Gaston to introduce others, Fernando said straightforwardly: "Lu Xien, Tang Pei recommended it after seeing your first paper. I, I got some inspiration from it, I think you have basic arcane thinking and certain potential, so I went to the library and went to see what you are, a good, very interesting young man. It compares my appetite. And then there are no mistakes in your two papers. This is very rare for a young man of your age. It is necessary to know that some of the guys in the top panel have the same naive mistakes and ridiculous Wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he may be praising himself, Lucien always thinks his words are very weird, people can’t hear it is praise, and completely Regardless of the one who is next to the highest panel of judges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beltlang Castle and the two missions to send a letter to the Dark Mountains show your potential for fighting and dealing with things. This is a lot of arcane in the parliament. What the teachers lack is also the efforts of the parliament to improve. I hope that you can continue to keep it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I think what you show, not Should be limited to elements and astrology, but step into a broader field, I want you to follow me to learn arcane and magic, become my students, do you have any opinions?" Storm dominated Fernando's slightly wretched smile convergence, The expression became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just thinking for a second, Lucien nodded firmly: "I am honored to be your student."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you are mine now. Student." Fernando answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Whether it’s Lucien, or Gaston, Morris, and Florencia, they all blurted out the surprising question, only the cold and quiet elements. The dominator "Haysey and the middle-aged men around Fernando did not have any unexpected look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "Now we are the relationship between the teacher and the student. Do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So simple and simple, there is a big arcane teacher as a teacher, Lu Xien suddenly has a strong sense of unreality, Gaston and others feel a bit ridiculous, according to the ancient magic empire to the magic parliament The tradition of recruiting formal students is a grand and serious matter that requires complex rituals to demonstrate changes in the identity of both parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have always known that Fernando is an eager surname, a grumpy, hateful trouble process, but he did not expect his "acceptance ceremony" to be as simple as these two sentences. The question and answer will be solved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien is a bit ignorant, Fernando’s face is a board: “You follow me to learn arcane and magic is the thing of both of us, since you are willing, I Also agree, do you still need troublesome rituals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, teacher, I have no doubt." Lucien also hates cumbersome, unnecessary The ceremony, so immediately free and easy to answer. The relationship between mentoring and apprenticeship lies in the inner identity of both parties, not the external ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon didn’t expect Lucien to answer so simply, and they were really like the idea of ​​mentoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando laughed and said: "Today is the scorpion of several of my students who have gathered together to exchange arcane and magical studies. Wait, you can participate, listen more. Listening to the latest research difficulties will help you master the foundation and choose the direction of your next research. I have something to talk to Hathaway, you and Tang spectrum go out and wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the study together, the soup smiled and looked at Lucien: "The teacher never praised others, and the evaluation of you just was very good."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also good..." There was a strange teacher suddenly, and it was a famous bad-tempered arcian. Lucien was always a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the feelings of Lucien, Florensa smiled and smiled: "The little guy, Lord Fernando is very strict with his disciples, but It is the most loved among all the legendary magicians. If it is not him, you may not agree with Hathaway, she hopes to be Lord Lavendi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Wendi?" If Fernando is not a Great Arcanist, Lucien would rather be familiar Mr. Ravendi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon is still that weird expression: "It is said that Lord Lavendi has been looking for the storm to dominate the Lord. Someone heard a fierce quarrel. Then Lavindi’s face was pale, and it went out like a storm. Every time he mentioned this, he was not in a good mood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............ Aalto, within the referee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Acting" Valdo looked at the report in his hand and said with anger: "Lusien Evans turned out to be a magician, he turned out to be a suspended animation, church and The whole city was teased as a fool! Be sure to grab him and tie him to the firearm!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure?” The cloth bishop Amorton’s eyes were half closed and his expression was plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "reviewer"’s low voice seems to contain endless anger: "From the passage of John’s report and the interrogation of the rest of the people, the road can be confirmed. Sean Evans is not dead. The villa is a trap set by him and the professor. On the one hand, in order to remove the traitor, the other magician who knows the headquarters of the Magic Council is removed. On the other hand, he perceives the clown in doubt. He, so he got rid of the dead and framed the clown. There was no problem before and after the straits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do Natasha know? Is it concealed, or cooperate?" Morton opened his eyes and his eyes lifted the chill of the substitutes and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
