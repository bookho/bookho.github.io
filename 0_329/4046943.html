			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray and bleak sky, the city that is upside down, there is no superb color and the solidification of a little bit of sound, so that the entire dead spirits have a eternal coldness and silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Downey’s two figures outside the city, the high-volume voice is high: “Reassured, nothing will happen, I just want to have a look He tried his best to see what he wanted to do and where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Carl trusts his brother very much, no more to say, "It should be a way to find out how to get out of trouble completely. Oh, if he seeks cooperation, we will not really seal and study him. Grandfather Fernando has a lot of experimental materials, and his father has already opened up a kind of arcane master. The road, the study of Him is more about trying to understand what is 'death', how to incorporate the current arcane system, and how much extraordinary power it can make, can be transformed into the legendary magic of the Necromancer..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall figure reached out and smashed his forehead: "You are not strong enough, you can only rely on talent, or do not say so much in the realm of death."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at everything around him and looked at the hall of the slum in the slum area. After a long time, he slowly returned to his heart and said with a smile: "I have always been yearning for music. It’s impossible to think of this situation coming here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a bit stunned, don’t understand that the mysterious existence pulls himself into the realm of the dead What to do, so he didn't even have the mind of the St. Hall in front of the "visit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he felt that his right hand was cold, and a sorrowful but hoarse voice echoed in his heart: "Go back, go back to your own place!" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is both grand and cold, shocking the soul of Downey’s soul, as if feeling the deepest call in the distance, it is the call from the deepest heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves him without any resistance, just as he wants to do that, stepping forward and marching toward the deepest part of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Downey’s ability to think has not been lost, wondering where this call comes from, where his destination is, but he does not feel himself There is something strange about "accepting summoning". It seems that this is his real thought, and it is a logical move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, Downey’s right hand began to glow with a layer of cool, monotonous black and white gray, which wrapped Downey’s body and made his eyes blue The pupil, the silver-white background of the magic badge, and the silver spots of the arcane badge are all presented. Walking between them, flickering, a step is like crossing a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Downey’s eyes lit up, a majestic, invisible black palace group reflected in his pupil, many palaces Towering into the pale sky, you can't see the top, it seems to lead to the home of the true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a brilliant and deep sight that Downey has never seen before. This is a grandiose that he can’t imagine, so he definitely stands there. Such as the same lifelike wax figure. However, Downey quickly shuddered and woke up from the shock, because he felt the horror of countless shares that could make his soul collapse. That is only The breath of black armor in the nightmare is higher than that of Robert Mentor and others who don’t know how many times it is. It is the breath of the body and mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mummy wrapped in a yellow-brown greased strip, looking at the black cloak, dragging the sickle, the face was foggy, flashing Two red-eyed monsters, looking at the golden skull floating up and down, looking at the huge white bone dragon, Downey hated his magical creature identification class for the first time, so that they recognized what they were at a glance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient mummies, the servant of death, the demon lich, the dragon of the dead, these are legendary undead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further afield, there is a lot of similar breath in the dense undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Biography, Legend..." Downey’s eyes are wide, if it’s in the realm of the dead, he’s already sweating, he’s so big, still the first I was so close to the legend, I witnessed the legend for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Downey’s inner fear made him subconsciously want to retreat, but the voice of the ancient sky still screamed: “Go back! Go back!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Downey step back Step by step, you will see the ancient mummies of evil and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s stomach trembled and the teeth collided up and down. I really wanted to faint in the past and escape the end of the legendary undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the ancient mummies fell directly like a mountain collapse, squatting on the ground, his head squatting at the foot of Downey . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the countless dead spirits around them all fell to the ground and smashed huge "waves", just like welcoming them. Dominate, their king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny looked at this scene with a stunned look, and there were countless toes in his heart, both horrified and with a feeling of being above the top. It was so wonderful and pleasant, no wonder so much People would rather risk their lives to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the legendary undead creatures are not me..." Downey reluctantly kept a awake, following the inner desire, flying forward, passing At the same time, whether it is a legendary undead, or a whole body rotten pussy, Downey can kill its small zombies, all smashed, tidy, neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the undead creatures become shorter, the scenes are empty, allowing Downey to see the distance, and then the line of sight with a pair of translucent amber giant eyes. Meet"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a legendary monster, but Downey, who is watching live shows all year round, is no stranger. It is a dragon, it is a crystal covered with transparent scales. Dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crystal dragon seems to be wearing something, so that its scales can also flow cold and dreamy light in the dead spirit world, but its state is very strange In the undead creatures, the claws are constantly pulling on something, with a gray, bulging bag hanging on the back, a black cloth covering his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Wei surges, Downey screams: "Monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster! "The crystal dragon was also shocked, and the slightly tender voice became sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one person and one dragon each turned and fled, it seems to be scared by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car, who looked at this scene in the distance, couldn’t help but laugh: "How come it comes here again? 'Garbage'!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has the items given by the father, will not be noticed by the legendary undead creatures, naturally come here to find valuable materials and gems." The tall figure smirked, "There are many materials here are very precious." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so dirty!" Karl squeezed his nose and his voice went high. "I don't want to be friends with it anymore!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall figure turned to Downey: "Is there any secret in the Temple of the Dead to be worthy of his return?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe there are arrangements to help him get out of trouble." Carl snorted at the back of the crystal dragon disappearing into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After fleeing the dragon monster, Downey entered the huge from the side door The black palace group, the inner cry is getting higher and higher, the sense of summoning is getting stronger and stronger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him faster and faster, and it seems that there is a big advantage in front of him waiting for him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a palace, Downey suddenly appeared, because the palace is lined with rows of bookshelves with countless dark yellow Books, the rotten taste is rich and tangy, and the instinct from the arcane masters makes Downey pause and look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These books must be very precious, otherwise they will not be so protected, and the color can be revealed in the dead world..." Downey thought with joy. He has a deep-rooted love for books, and they have changed their own destiny! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I really wanted to take a look at the ancient books, but the strong call to let Downey can not stop, crossed the bookshelf, and rushed to the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
