			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black mist in front, no fingers, no resounding, the whole person is like being trapped in the purest and most peaceful death, even the soul is stupid. There is no idea at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a touch of gray color shines through this rich black fog, Donnie trembles, gets rid of that state of solidification, and finds himself standing In a wilderness filled with black sand, the sky is gray and bleak, as always, the scene of the dead spirit, and not far from the front stands a dark and broken palace, simple and desolate, grand and majestic, exudes endless death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Downey’s heartbeat unconsciously speeds up again, as if something in the old palace is calling himself, this kind of incitement is like that. Strong, so clear, so irresistible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something in the palace calling me?" The duck-like voice sounded in Donnie's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donny slightly looked back and found that Sami, Carl and a fat man were standing behind him, looking at the palace not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount, who is this fat man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Donnie did not ask for an exit, was able to have a nightmare with himself, can be included in Carl’s soul call, he should be a close relationship with himself. Unfortunately, I didn't bring my notebook...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind Sami constantly trembled and buried her face tightly around Sami’s neck, seemingly very afraid The black palace and the things in it, but at the same time, its hands are pulling Sami's body, as if urging him to enter the palace, close to the thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this level of 'dreamland'?" Carl was half confused and whispered in excitement, and then swayed as if he had commanded the charge. "Let's go in and see!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie and Sami did not answer, because under the strong call, they have already moved forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ridiculous and cold black wilderness, the four people approached the black palace and saw the door carved with the pale pattern,<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These patterns are distorted, mysterious and ancient, and seem to contain some kind of hard-to-touch laws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly. The loud and screaming voice came, scaring Downey, Sami and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr made a defensive stance, eagerly looking at the place where the sound came, and could make a sound in a dream similar to the dead world. "Either powerful, or not weird! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the top of a broken stone column near the gate, standing with a semi-rotted owl, whose body of black rotten meat showed pale bones, two Only the wings are gray and white, and the head. One eye has been corrupted into a black hole. One retains a strange yellow-brown color. Looking at Donnie and others in a cold and indifferent manner, the mouth screamed with screams and screams, and listened to Donnie, Sami, and Jones, who were afraid of the cold and shivered. Is this the messenger of death? Is this a reminder of the sound? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An owl that can keep its original appearance in the palace, nothing strange, have you not seen undead, such an owl, I have not dissected One hundred, there are fifty..." Carl said with a slight disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Downey is thankful to Carl for his arrogance, which frees himself from the screaming and eccentric owl, otherwise he doubts his own The soul will be broken a little bit here. Part of the palace, although it is not clear why Karl is not affected, but his feelings are really true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go in." After Carl said a lot, he opened the door with the mysterious pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is silent and open, and it is dark. It seems that there are countless monsters hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, the moment the door opened, Donnie, Sami, and Jones clearly sensed the thing, it was in front, just in front of the hall ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summons seems to have turned into a substantial voice, Downey and others subconsciously took the step, while Karl looked around and looked curiously. Around, silver and purple eyes are a deep desire to explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go, the clearer the call is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on! You will gain powerful power and you will have a long life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Come on! Power, wealth, glory, and beauty are waiting for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Don't bother to study hard , to study, you can grasp the power of unparalleled immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗." In the heart of the conversation, Carl laughed out loud, and Downey’s head was congested. Sami and Jones woke up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" Downey asked subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl can’t stop laughing: “The difference between the words of this temptation is too big, the first two sentences are very formal and ambitious, and the last sentence is too specific, haha I don’t have to study hard and study to get the strength. It’s just like preparing for someone who has taken the unified entrance exam. I seem to see a wretched uncle who is holding a donut and telling the little girl. Let me go, every day is delicious, no need to go to school any more, no need to complete the exercises, haha, don't you feel so small, funny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not think..." Sami blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie and Jones also nodded, Carl's humor is very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you hear the summoning voice?" Suddenly, Downey wakes up. Doesn't he always say that he can't feel the call? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl smiled and said: "I have some special abilities..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't explain too More, the gentle and quiet face is full of curiosity, and I seem to want to see this tasteless "tempter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the hall, there are seven steps in front, and above the steps is a deep and majestic dark throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And above the throne, is a strange black full-body armor, it is filled with cold light, sitting like a real person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sits quietly, but like stuffed in this world, dominates everything, behind the helmet mask is the darkness that can’t be seen, just like everyone Unable to escape and see through the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I saw this full body armor, Downey, Sami, and Jones’s heartbeats became soothing from the fierce, my eyes were confused, my expression was intoxicated, and my right hand stretched out. Out, you have to touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the vast horror is in front of you, you can grasp the thrill of everything so clearly, as long as you get a part of the whole body armor, you can easily get it by wearing it on yourself. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such a temptation make it possible for Downey, Sami, and Jones, who are still magic apprentices, to resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he kept the awake Carl, he frowned at the moment, his expression changed and he looked at Donnie and others to get the black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black wilderness, which is full of gravel, the two figures are watching the huge palace quietly, it is Felipe and the former young man . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough..." The young man snorted and his slightly lazy expression did not change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Downey, Sami, and Jones quickly touched the weird armor, he suddenly extended his right hand and pressed it into the void in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his whole person became illusory, as if it was diffused, everywhere, and the entire black wilderness swayed, and the ground quickly split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe inserted his hands and silently watched the change, his expression still flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
