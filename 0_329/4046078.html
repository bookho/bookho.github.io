			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are short, the expression is a little anxious, Lucien is acting like a normal person who first encountered such a thing, of course, compared to the rush For most people who are irritated and uneasy, they have to look calm. After all, when talking to the cult priest with stationery, Lucien has already revealed his own calm character, so he is afraid of it and is worried. Over-fire, and complete calm and calm, will cause the other party's suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien enters the state of caster concentration, the soul seems to be another person on the high, looking down on his body, carefully sensing the crowd around, so anxious Hurrying out to rush to the aristocratic area is a temptation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the time of the week is close to noon, it is the most lively time in the Adejan area during the day, the strength of the other side is higher than the current Lu Xien, let Lucy En is no discovery, can not be as gangsters as before, can rely on the strong mental power of ordinary people to blur the induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of the aristocratic and Adejan districts are open, but very deserted, with only a small number of poorest and hardest working poor people in the noble villas. , rushed to do things after the week. '<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two guards stood beside the door and looked at the poor with a little superiority. They lost the chance to become knights and joined the city. After the Guards, they were quickly infested by the bustling Aalto, forgetting many things learned from the Cavaliers training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, they saw a black dress, a white shirt, medium height, temperament and clothing are not ordinary, Lucien hurriedly came over, weird The subconscious stopped it: "Sir, what do you do in the aristocratic area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you need to go to the nobility area for inspection during the day?" Although I forced myself to calm down, my inner anxiety was real, so the tone and attitude of speaking were not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randell immediately stopped knowing that he made a mistake and then was oppressed by Lucien’s “tough and arrogant” attitude and had to make an excuse immediately. Apologize: "Sorry, sir, the recent investigation of the devil's believers has made us too nervous, and please forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently jaws, Just going straight past, suddenly in my heart, whispered: "I went to the noble area to find my classmate, Felice Hein, her father is Mr. Haier? Mr. Haien, the clerk of the town hall, ask her Where is the home in the nobility area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yu 尓书书 remembered in No. 158, Noble District, a former villa of the Haien family." Rand Er was impressed by the Urba, who was responsible for assisting the consul in the city hall, because the Aalto City Guard was more or less managed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said shortly: "Thank you." Then passed through the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the nobility area, there are many knights, big knights, and the cult priest may not be too close to himself, so let him know in advance. If you still can't keep up with it, if you don't know what to do, it means that he has no means to track and monitor himself for a long time. If you can find a way to get rid of him, you can do some preparations. Keep up, then the next step is to test what he is doing to monitor himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of Lucien’s departure, Randall complained: “This guy is dressed like a gentleman, but even the location of the nobility. I don't know, is it by the face seduce to Miss Felice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time Lucien entered the nobility area. Compared to the night before the rainstorm, the aristocratic area looks a lot more beautiful, the trees are shaded, the flowers are overflowing, and the building is very occupied. The wide villas reflect the architectural style of each of them. They have the gloomy and magnificent period of the ancient magical empire. They have the solemn and solemnity of the peak of the church rule. There are more than a hundred years of Rooky-style luxury decoration. Asian style, and often there is only one villa on one road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage rides slowly but lightly on a wide stone road. Every carriage passes through Lucien and casts a strange look. Although Lucien is dressed in formal attire, and can't judge the value of clothes in the distance, but go out, there is no carriage ride, certainly not a noble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien was anxiously anxious, but the surface was still very calm, responding with gentleman etiquette: "Thank you for your compliment, beautiful lady, can I have this honor to know your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, I am Yvette? Hill, a good friend of Felice, Mr. Evans, are you coming to the aristocratic area to find her?" Yvette looked at the interest with interest. A musical genius that is less than 18 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hill family, together with the Haien family and the Lafayette family, is the three major families of the Vaurit Principality, with the exception of the Violet family. The count of the county. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Yvette’s self-introduction, Lucien recognized the Hill family’s coat of arms consisting of rifles and violent bears in the carriage: “Yes Miss Hill, I am looking for Felice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you may have to wait, Felice is still in the Golden Cathedral. Because of the success of Mr. Victor's concert last night, she asked for a separate prayer to thank the Lord for his blessing.” Yvette smiled very flatterly. “And, call me Yvette, I am now Mr. Evans, your faithful listener. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien strongly pulled out a smile: "Miss Yvette, you can also call me Lucien. I will wait outside the home of Felice." She is back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you are two years younger than me, it is an unimaginable genius." Yvette put down the gauze cap and revealed it. Face, "If you don't mind, let me send you outside the home of Felice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she signals the maid to open the compartment door, without hesitation Do not worry about damage to reputation invite Lucien up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not refuse, since Yvette is a member of the Hill family, she can also buy moonlight roses within the family, if Fei Li Silk refused, and he could have one more road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the carriage, Lucien immediately smelled a sweet scent with a hint of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yvette sat sat with satisfaction and looked down: "Genius is really different from ordinary people, not at all shy. They always think about it and don't dare Come up, worry about the accusations of others." She leaned slightly, and some of the large lavender dresses opened slightly in the neckline, revealing a seductive white and plump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has a mood to see this, barely smiled and replied: "Go your own way, let others say go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very fond of words. Lucine, you are more interesting than I thought." Yvette’s eyes lit up, but he sat up straight, not so close. Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage went very slowly, and Yvette casually exchanged music with Lucien, from time to time by speaking, approaching Lucien or producing a slight body. Contact, seems to be playing a game called seduce, but she encountered Lucien, and Lucien was very bad and impatient at this time, so it behaved like a very straight, very dull The gentleman completely ignored the charm of Yvette and made her a little depressed and lame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half an hour, Yvette’s carriage stopped outside the luxurious three-storey villa of Felice’s home. At this time, Felice The carriage has also arrived at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, how do you spend with Yvette?" Felice showed a strange expression on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked down from the carriage: "When I came to see you, I met Miss Yvette. She kindly sent me over."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy’s expression is more eccentric, with a little anger: “Yvit, what have you done?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What can I do? I just kindly sent Lucien to come." Yvette looked at Felice in the window with a smile. "Reassured, Felice, recently, compared to musicians, I I prefer the mysterious magician." I can't say that I seduce failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you change your hobby?" Felice snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yvette looks forward to the tunnel: "On last night, when I heard the Archbishop of Sald and the Grand Duke, the discussion of His Royal Highness, they described I am very interested in the mysterious and weird magician 'Professor'. I have never tasted the taste of a magician. I don’t know the dark guys who always hide their faces in their hoods. What would it look like when they were stripped? , see what a beautiful woman would look like, what would it look like at that time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
