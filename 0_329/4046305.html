			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of the Sky? The Kingdom of Holm?" Mercury blurted out in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged and reindeer are also incredible: "Rentat? Near the capital?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is completely out of their expectations. Like the former Lucien, they never thought that the Magic Council could exist in such a bright and honest way, in an orthodox kingdom that was not declared a heretic or evil country by the church. It does not seem to be much worse than the period of the ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their original idea, the Magic Council is either deep in the dark mountains, or in a different space or half-plane, and then through the secret The magical array is connected to the main material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides having long been from the mouths of the great aristocrats of Earl of Hain and Earl of Lafayette, from the rumored Grand Duchess, the location of the Magic Council headquarters was faintly guessed. Then, with the help of Lucien, the "Sage" Viscount Viscount looked calmer, and the rest of the magic apprentices expressed their shock more or less, or quickly or slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully discerning their amazed emotions, Lucien laughed and said: "No doubt, the Magic Council headquarters is in Aringe, and got Hall. The acquiescence of the nobles of the kingdom of the kingdom completely overwhelmed the church power in the kingdom. If the church cost a great price, the rigorous protection was arranged in the Glorious Cathedral, and there was enough time to wait for the cardinal of Lance to help, and the nobles maintained The idea of ​​balance, the Kingdom of Holm has long been completely controlled by the Parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? Mr. Professor?" Mercury asked a little unbelievably In her heart, the young girl born in the Principality of Vaoli, who grew up in the Principality of Vaolirit, the church is unbeatable and powerful, and it has a lot of space for different powers. If it is not a split between the North and the South, I have already let myself wait for the magicians. Anything is going on. It is really incredible that the Magic Council can grow into a behemoth that contends against the church in some way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the question of most magic apprentices, even if the "sage" is no exception, the nobles may be able to feel the kingdom of Holm and other opposite the Stormwind Strait. A bit unusual - because they rarely know the situation from books and stories, but only the great aristocrats who are qualified to sit in the same VIP box with Dagong can know exactly the bad situation there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien spoke about the development of the Magic Council, the achievements of the Arcanists, and the status of the Magic Council. Lastly: "The Parliament is already full." The second strong force in the mainland. In Aringe, you can get free access to the basics of arcane and magic. You can study magic with great brilliance. You can avoid the exchange of ideas and exchange materials by the church. You can get it with magic. It belongs to your status, identity and wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No inflammatory tone, no exaggerated expression, just plain words, but let the mercury, hanged people and other people Trembling, excitement, people who have never had a similar experience can imagine a dark depression, a sudden pain in the dangerous pain, and a feeling of a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is good at keeping calm, the tone is almost choked at the moment: "Professor, Professor, how can we go? I think the church must be blocked." The strait and the border. Can you take us in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes other magic apprentices suddenly wake up, yeah, the light has not really come yet, The front is still dark and dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have my own business, I can't send you." Lucien refused to help first, then told them the two routes, and finally: " If you have flying objects, you can consider taking the Northern Shahran route. If you don't have it, you can go to Stourke to find the ferry. After their observation and test, you will have the opportunity to go to Allinge. Yes, if you arrive at Stu When you are not a formal magician, you need to show your potential and ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not disclose the identity of Granny, Because these magic apprentices are likely to have church spies, they just tell them how to find a ferry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Stewart’s Magic Council liaisons accepted the lessons of a serious loss a few years ago, and had an observation and inquiry for all magicians and magic apprentices. The strict process of identification, testing, and testing, even if the spy reveals the news, let the vigils change their status, it is difficult to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury calms down the mood, thanks to the authenticity: "Thank you, Professor, if you have the opportunity, I hope to see you in Allinge." She and the Sage Similarly, there is no doubt about Lucien’s last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can tell this news to other magic circles, don't hide it selfishly, let everyone have a chance to choose." Lucien snorted, then smiled and said: "Right, after tonight, you guys It's best to change your identity and hide places. I worry about other magic circles and spies, and the church doesn't need to know the illusion that the guys at the Magic Council headquarters are in the circle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Professor!" Mercury and others first glimpsed, then answered seriously, without doubting Lucian's words. He personally disposed of a traitor and let more than 20 horrors of the night watchman die! At the same time, you must be cautious and careful, no one wants to fall close to the light when they are close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange silence lasted for a while, and the chilling voice of the hanged person showed a bit of enthusiasm: "Mr. Professor, I heard you mention the basics of arcane and magic. I also know that you are a knowledgeable middle-level magician. Can you give us a general introduction of this content? Our materials are left to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Probably the content of the introduction is free in the parliament, I don't take advantage of you, just talk about it." Lucien's tone is hoarse and hoar, I can't say that you can't see the materials you have here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask Mr. Professor to explain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the words of Lucien, including the Sage Inside, everyone stood up and solemnly prayed to the teacher's courtesy in the ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien explained to them the current arcane and magic system in a way that established "Arcane" thinking from the beginning. They are all stunned and inconceivable, which is quite different from what they have learned before, but trying to analyze magic has an unusual harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the last time you saw the "Arcane" journal, they didn't understand it at the time. After getting the explanation from Lucien, they only I feel that I have opened a new door in front of me, and the door is so deep and so vast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the end of the secret meeting, the sages and others are still immersed in the "new world", even if it is part of the conflict with their past cognition, professor Mr. is also well-founded and convincing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their current level and occlusion-like environment without high-level characters, it’s hard to have a solid cognitive world, it’s the general crayon When absorbing various knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the underground secret room, the sages, mercury and other people lined up again, solemnly helping the right hand to salute: "I hope to have the opportunity to listen to Professor Mr. Teaching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the teaching and teaching, the professors are no longer just the big characters in the purification sequence, the horrible magicians in their minds, but more vaguely It is the embodiment of the magical parliament that represents the ocean of arcane and magical knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "My students are very 'hate' me. If you have the opportunity, I hope you don't regret it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The doubtful mercury and others witnessed Mr. Professor and the sage leave together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ A hidden place in the Alto sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? The professor appeared in Aalto?!" The clown stood up, and the dark, dark eyes on the funny smile seemed to burn with two flames. Juliana, who was scheduled to stay in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana is excited and has a shudder: "Yes, just an hour ago, he attended the original magic circle and confirmed it." Identity! This is the news that the spies we placed in that circle are the first to return!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor is a famous figure in the purification sequence, the spy can not delay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown became quiet and silent, then he laughed and laughed so crazy and so desolate: "Lu Xien returned to Aalto, the professor appeared Aalto, if they don't have a close relationship, I will go to the fire! I will teach the big men, and you see it now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, You are waiting for the good news, as long as you catch the professor and testify to the way out, Sean Evans is when you return to the referee!" Juliana is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
