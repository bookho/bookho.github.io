			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter months, the night comes extraordinarily early, and the northerly Lentat is blowing the whistling wind, let everyone on the street The pedestrians tightened the coat and held the hat to speed up the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For them, the biggest difference now is that the street lights on both sides of the road have covered the streets of Rantat, the magical crystal lamp It lights up the road where I wait for people to go home. It is no longer like the past. Only a few prosperous streets have installed arc street lights. Most of the citizens will either use the silver moon and the stars when they are on the road in winter, or they can bring their own lanterns. Just touch the night, so the road often falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfman Nasdell walked down the last magic steam train along the crowd and set foot on the smooth stone ground of the six-star platform - due to the city of the world It is part of the magic or magical defense system. Therefore, except for a few very special cities such as Aringe, most cities are not likely to demolish walls, gates, etc., and they are not allowed to give up their defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the magic steam train can not enter the city at night, with the last shift of the day, and then can only temporarily stop at the temporary platform outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, the magic steam train is really the same as recorded in the book, comfortable, fast, convenient, and indeed a very good alchemy item." Nasdell With a sigh of relief, they watched them form a "white fog" in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a typical Holm kingdom clothing, a white shirt, a brown sweater, a black double-breasted long dress, a top hat of the same color, and a hand in his hand. With a decorative cane, the burly figure holds the clothes tightly, and at first glance is a man with great strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasd looked around at the platform and thought: "Unfortunately, the magic steam train can't travel in the dark mountains, only the silver moon is considered." Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Mountains are full of dangerous space cracks and magical creatures. More than 80% of steam trains may go out and never come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Silver Moon Wasteland" is a different space controlled by the werewolf family. The name is not quite consistent with the actual situation. It is not a wasteland of silver moonlight. It is a very rich and prosperous plain, but the wolves insist on naming this alien space, so with the passage of thousands of years, its original name has been forgotten. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After looking at the platform and discovering that there was nothing to watch, Nasdell pulled the clothes and went out of the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prince Dubner gave me this task is a matter of value to me. He definitely thinks that I am a rare wolverine with a clear mind and good thinking and Observing members, I can't live up to his attention." Nasdell proudly and gratefully thought, the pace of the feet under the subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal has always claimed to be the most wise and scheming of the werewolf. It is the "idol" in Nasdall’s mind, imitating him everywhere. Behaviour and way of doing things - although other princes and vampires laugh at Dubnaar as a true straight-line thinking creature, reckless and unplanned. But this does not change Nasdell's view, they must be smashing the prince of the prince! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping out of the platform, Nasdell’s eyes suddenly lit up, full of hustle and bustle, as if the starry sky in the sky was reflected in the city of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magical crystal lamp sways its light anywhere in his sight, whether it is a street light, a family light in a house, or an alchemy car. The lights of the carriages and the carriages of the carriages all have a feeling of warmth and tranquility. The light is connected into one piece, and it is dreamy and shocking. It seems to cover up the stars in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one direction, two tall tower-shaped buildings overlook the entire city of Rentt, and their towers are inlaid with a glimpse of盏明净的水晶灯· Rendering itself beautiful and noble, left a deep impression on Nasdall, who was first arrived in Renttart City, that is the most intuitive beauty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Nasdell stopped and walked in the same place, as the full moon night could not restrain himself The brain is short-lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was no Lentat? The tallest is the Holm Royal Magic Tower. The slightly shorter one is Holm Radio and National Electromagnetic Wave. The management committee..." A passing passenger next to him looked at Nasdell with a funny smile and answered his question casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That must be the look of the country!" Nasdell felt that he had guessed it right, but in order to complete the task of the prince, he could only force himself to control himself, not to smash the passenger, "it must not be revealed." The identity of the werewolf! How can I pretend to wait for other things to pretend that I am not the first to come to Rantat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a strong presence of the werewolf family Self-respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With luggage, Nasdell called a carriage and drove to the bustling streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are so many people? Are they not afraid of cold?" When passing through a square, Nasdell saw hundreds of thousands of people standing in the cold wind. The heart suddenly felt very strange, they are not as cold-resistant as the werewolf...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After letting the carriage stop, Nasdell stood on the edge of the square and saw the central The giant horn heard a sweet and touching voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next show is the body mystery that everyone likes very much. We are fortunate to have the Viscount of John Wellsley, who is a great knight. With a wealth of experience in tempering the body, he will tell us what kind of exercise concept should be avoided before the body is fully grown, and where to strengthen your body...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasd’s eyes lit up, took a piece of information from the baggage and flipped it through quickly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, he turned to specific One page, then constantly listening to the ear, and constantly looking down at the information in his hand, and finally, he laughed aloud, his heart is very self-satisfied: "The original is this <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The voice of mystery, the intelligence is not wrong. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to the Welshley Viscount, Nasdell opened his mouth: "Is this not a formal knight exercise?" Can actually be promoted directly on the radio! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This surprised him. Even the most open Aalto, there is no such thing happening. You must be a waiter of a knight to get a similar Method.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aristocrats do not protest? Or are they better? To be announced in order to fight against the church? Nasdell thought for himself, but soon his attention was drawn to the wonderful show of "The Voice of Mystery", which was like a drunkenness. This is the entertainment he has never experienced before!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "dark mountain range", it is difficult to receive the "voice of mystery" due to the influence of harsh spaces such as space gaps and fog.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The voice of mystery, it’s great, a hundred times stronger than the intelligence description. Fortunately, I came to Renttat! Nasdell said excitedly, unconsciously, the "voice of mystery" has ended.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd in the square leaves, he is full of curiosity Behind the giant horn, there is nothing valuable except the wires and some simple devices.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what is this? Nassell came to the wall on the other side of the square along the wire. I found that there were dozens of strange holes in the wall, three in a group, one on top of the other side down the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasdl watched for a while. I couldn’t see the role of these holes. I wanted to ask passers-by, but I was worried about being a countryman, so he decided to do his own research. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a werewolf who grew up in the dark mountains, Nasdell understands that even if something doesn't seem dangerous, he can't just touch it, so he is very cautious. Remove a steel needle from the baggage and use it to replace your finger. If there is any danger, you can avoid it in time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The holes are brightly arranged It is obviously not too dangerous to be near the square without worrying about the citizens. ······ Nasdell, who thinks she is smart, made a very reasonable inference.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look around and confirm that it’s already dead in the night, Del inserted the steel needle into the hole.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver current was pulled out of the hole and hit the Nasdall along the steel needle. Let him avoid it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
