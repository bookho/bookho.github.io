			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the silence of Lucien, Natasha asked with a little doubt: "Don't like me so straightforward?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I like your initiative very much, I like your atmosphere very much. If you are ashamed and cringe, it is not Natasha that I like." Lucien also actively expressed his feelings. "But that sentence I always feel too 'dominant', suitable for men."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to the original version of this sentence - crazy gods give way Sean left a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha gave a long sigh, then sneered and said: "In fact, when I said this, there was a scene in my heart. I played "Moonlight", creating a calm atmosphere of faint sorrow, then left the piano, walked to your front, kneel down, hold your hand, gently kissed the back of your hand, looked up Gazing into your eyes, expressing your affectionately, haha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ridiculed, Natasha, this is what she expected for Sylvie Ya’s romantic confession scene is on my own? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After clearing the laughter, Natasha said with a smile: "Just kidding, I know you don't like it. But, to be honest, it's weird. Ah, how good I was to create a 'romantic' knight, why every time I try to talk to you, the topic will always develop in a strange direction, destroying the original atmosphere?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good at creating romance? Good at telling love? I remember the confession or I taught you." Lucien smiled and teased Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s voice became louder and very refuted: “This is just a sentence, I can say love words. At that time, I was relying on romance and love. Silvia pursued it! Well, this is not the point. The point is why is there a strange change in the romantic sweet atmosphere between us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and Under the scour of new feelings, she seems to have forgotten the pain of past feelings and can refer to Silvia more normally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, I like this atmosphere very much, I feel very relaxed with you, very pleasant, very warm, will go on like this, don't worry about feelings The change. "Lu Xien thought about it, but also expressed his feelings with initiative and frankness, but compared to Natasha, Lucien always felt that this kind of words would be a bit old-fashioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed softly, then went deep and said: "Me too, it makes me feel very happy and comfortable, just as we started a long time ago. The same will continue to the end of life. When I was with Silvia, I always worried, worried that one day she would choose to give up, but with you, I am very relieved, because I know that you are forever Here, always by my side. This has nothing to do with the surname and external pressure, even if you are a girl, I believe that you will not choose to give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lu Xien, although I have had emotional experiences, I have never had the experience of getting along with men. If I have a bad place, or exceed your bottom line, please tell me, I will pay attention. The reason why I and Silvia have problems before is that we are not honest enough with each other and communication is not enough. I want to protect our feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiles, a little excited but control The sound, try to make it softer: "Natasha, me too, I have no emotional experience, if there is no place to do it well enough, too clumsy, please don't give up, tell me frankly."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just like your clums!" Natasha's voice became a bit hoarse, charming Lucien's ear. "I think this year my oysters can spend with you." I am very happy and very yearning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of gift is needed?" Lucien asked half-jokingly, of course, this kind of thing had to be prepared. There are surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha whispered and said: "What gift do I like the most, you should know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Lu Xien was suddenly speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Natasha followed and laughed again: "Just kidding, I know this is your bottom line. You never let me put down my family and let go. Responsibility to run away, I will also respect your thoughts, at most occasionally fantasizing in the heart, unless one day, you can be willing. For me, the best oyster gift is that you can accompany me through the early morning." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien had thought that Natasha would be ashamed when she said the last sentence. She couldn’t think that she had just said it in a big way, so in order to protect the dignity of the man, she also said: "I miss you too. "Miss you all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Natasha said with a slightly hoarse voice, "When I go, I will pick your favorite long skirt." Style, pick your favorite stockings, do you want black, or other colors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is full of temptation, Lucien is hot, just to answer, Natasha broke the electromagnetic communication with a smirk and made Lucien depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study room, squatting back and forth, Lucien said in the heart: "The last time I was pushed down by Natasha, I must take the initiative next time, push her down." Otherwise, there is no dignity of the male surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, what should I do then? What distance should I keep with her to easily push her down? And won't be overthrown by her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Into the room, if she was in front, I immediately hugged her from behind, sucking her earlobe, This will make her weaker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you walk side by side into the room, then use other topics to draw her attention, well, not as direct Boldly confessing, she was surprised to react to it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or use the romantic atmosphere to stimulate the softness of her heart, with me being pushed down?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if she is as direct as yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lucien The beginning of the "tight" and "Natasha pulled down plan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lovers of love are trying to control the number of communications, But it also kept the frequency every two days, and the time soon reached the month of the fire (July). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sorted out his clothes and told the housekeeper Leo: "You bring a few skilled assistants to review the accounts of those companies, I They have already said it with Arthur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no specific management, Lucien maintains his own phone call in Aringe with a quarterly check-up method. Telegraph company, minerals and harvest company, 'Elemental Gifts' company's rights. Although they should have no courage to corrupt their annuities in their current status and place, they are stricter and better for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master." Leo answered reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great hatred has been reported. After the life is stable, he also has plans to re-establish his family. He is currently interacting with a middle-aged woman who studies magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the magic tower, Lucien went directly to the Atomic Research Institute, intending to continue the analysis of the eight-ring magic "scoring of the spell" in a circle, let the magic go early Strength matches the cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the office, Lucien saw that Annick, Sprint, Katrina and other students were holding an "Arcane" waiting for each other. Yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Katrina, Reyia, have your superconductor papers published?" Lucien thought it was this thing that made them happy and excited. Restraint, after all, this is the first time they have published a paper on "Arcane." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina smiled brilliantly: "Published, teacher, just in the third part of this "Arcane"."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And during this period, many electromagnet magicians wrote letters and even had direct visits." Lei Yi Li Ya was also very happy, and this treatment made her flattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the arcade badges of the two girls and found that they had all successfully upgraded to the fourth level, so he nodded slightly: "This job is still Go on, um, is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most popular name of Sprint is urgent, open the "Arcane" road: "Teacher, look at the first In a paper, the idea put forward by Lord Oliver solved the problem of the light speed experiment of the Speaker of the House of Lords, and gave a formula for the transformation of the length of the material in relation to the movement of the ether."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several students looked forward and looked at Lucien reading. I hope he can point out the problem of this paper. What makes them stunned is that Lucien just turned over and closed the journal, and his face was calm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher?" Heidi couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up his eyebrows: "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have nothing, ideas "Heidi hesitated, or asked directly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his "Arcane" journal: "What do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a brief coagulation, Sprint eagerly said: "Teacher, this is the light speed experiment used to explain the Lord of the Speaker, this is a blow to the particle theory! Now Ariel's magicians who support particle theory are Waiting for the Speaker, Lord Storm, Lord Hathaway, and your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words broke Shen Ning, others suddenly Tongue up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those fluctuations say that supporters are starting to smug again, and they have acquired new weapons!" Heidi said dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, do you think there is any loophole in this paper?" Annick asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I always feel that this paper is a bit wrong, but I can't find anything wrong." Chely held her own hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be just an idea..." Katrina and Reyia said at the same time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the light quantum hypothesis put forward by his teacher Lucian, and he belongs to the elemental faction, several of them are all supporters of particle theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said for a long time, Sprint and other talents found that the teacher Lu Xien is still a calm look, as if the papers he and others saw are just illusions. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi is puzzled: "Teacher, are you not angry? Not angry? Don't want to refute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What do I want to be angry?" Lucien pointed to the "Arcane" journal in his hand and laughed. "I just looked at it. Lord Oliver just proposed a theoretical explanation and is still at the stage of envisioning. It only shows that it may be like this, but it cannot explain why this is the case, and there are no experiments and phenomena to confirm, why should I be angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi I patted my chest in a sigh of relief and joked: "It turned out to be like this. I thought the teacher was betraying the particle theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other students are similar Look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at them and said very seriously: "When did I say that I am a supporter of particle theory?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Heidi, Sprint, Cherie, and Katrina almost dropped their chins to the ground. Even the more sturdy Annick and Reyia were too sluggish. Isn't your light quantum hypothesis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the interference and diffraction experiments can be explained from the particle point of view, I have the same opinion on particle theory and volatility, and all have problems, can't really Explain the essence.” Lucien seized the opportunity to instill his own ideas into the students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several young people are dull, don’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien’s monocle became hot and someone tried to contact him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien?" Raven’s loud voice sounded. "Do you see today's "Arcane"? What do you think?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Lucien suddenly laughed, no matter how many awards he received, how many subversive theories were proposed, in Lavendi, Gaston In the old authority, I am not really a true authority, but a genius similar to the sudden inspiration, so when they have problems to discuss, they will never communicate with themselves for the first time, but " After the submission of the new alchemy, with its own complete system, everything has undergone subtle changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
