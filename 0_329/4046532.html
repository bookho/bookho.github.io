			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No response?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough weird!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long-awaited feeling of Lucian's horror, like something that had been waiting for a long time finally happened, and the remaining boots upstairs finally landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more attempts to call, no more wasted time, Lucien decisively, indicating that the "Thunder Angel" hiding in another bomb shelter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preventing accidents" means preventing problems with El! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be able to create a vain ruined ball condensed, and two needle-shaped red awns on Congos' white skull stare at Lucien, and he will be jailed. Locked in, let him rise from the heart of the chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Congers flew out in the left rear, with six wings behind him, entangled with thunder and holy light, driving the gods Remnant breath, just like he is the master of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fierce blazing angel, he is in the second level of existence in the domain of God, and can replace some of the authority of El! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus’s white gimmick can’t see the expression, the ruined ball flashes and appears next to Lucien, and he doesn’t know when to read it. Moved the mantra:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The soul is imprisoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been guarding close to the ninth level The lord of the gods sneaked him with "The Ring of Congas", but there are several legendary magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul..." The hard voice that almost overlaps with the Congers mantra sounds, and huge magical fluctuations emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers was innocent to see the stone statue in the original "God of the Divine", shocked to find Lucien wearing a black monster on his right hand The ring, that looks so familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can he recognize the essence of the world when he is promoted to higher levels?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Maybe!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Congus has an illusion that the soul collapses and the cognitive world collapses, which completely contradicts his common sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Forbidden!" The end of the weird and strange words, Lucien’s spiritual power is like a long river that breaks into the dike, and it’s poured into Conger. At the moment of the destruction of the ball, the trigger started, and he flashed to the other side, got rid of the lock, and watched the ruin become the "black" of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom soul emerges around Congos, dragging a small tail and trying to get into his body, suddenly, two red needles on Congers' face Mang solidified there, no more flicker, the "time stop" area was disintegrated, Natasha returned to normal, and then she did not look at Congers, and swung the sword to a corner of the ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the slight magical fluctuations on the white bones wrapped by the soul came out, and Conggs disappeared into the spot, flashing to the corner not far away. Get rid of the illusory souls that have not really penetrated, but the forehead just greets the "pale justice"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the estimate and arrangement of Lucien based on the effect of "transient teleportation". When there is a holy atmosphere in the rest of the world, undead Intuition has 80% chance of choosing here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short-term influence of "the soul is imprisoned" is not thinking ability, can only rely on instinct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A firm and gentle color emerges above the long sword, two illusory horror gaps wrap around, Congers' black cloak slams apart, white bones The shelf smashed, the white skull split into three pieces, and the mouth screamed sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the golden skull was rotated in place, and the sense of time and space twisted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the pale righteous resistance, she was swept away by the horrible sound waves, and fell heavily on the ground. The corners of her mouth overflowed with blood and were seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Chaotic transmission... Still not able to kill him, the legend is really difficult to kill." Lucien's mental strength is almost exhausted, and even the strength to raise his hand is stubborn. "Get out of here and leave, the strength of Congus has not really lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main body of the demigod lich is that The golden skull, the cymbal shelf is mainly used for constant part of the magic, and the loss is not a problem. Therefore, Congos now retains at least 95% of its strength. After returning, it must be vented with legendary magic. Natasha has also been seriously injured. If she does not want to escape now, then there is no other way out except that it is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn’t have much to say, walked a little embarrassedly to Lucien’s side and lifted him up, ready to leave the Death Valley, now the mysterious world is out of control The interval has been getting longer and longer. Before Congers returned to escape one kilometer, he would not want to find himself as easily as before. This is really a hope of surviving! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I was seriously injured, the speed was barely maintained. As long as Congers moved a little further, we were safe." Natasha has some Rejoicing in comforting Lucien, at the same time, watching the surroundings with caution, did not need Lu Xien reminder, seeing the lightning angel standing there, she understood that El had a problem, need to be careful of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the soul has not fallen, everything around has suddenly changed, the collapsed ruins have risen again, and the small city decorated with agate jasper is as new as yesterday’s, holy shrine The light that has spread all over again, and everything is like a real mountain of heaven, except that those white souls and angels can no longer be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El flew out of the "air-raid shelter", wearing an olive wreath, wearing a white robe, slender hands, smiling and looking at Lucien and the sword Natasha, slanting and vertical: "You have no mental strength, a serious injury, even if you have a legendary ring and this legendary sword, there is no ability to resist."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His momentum is erratic and shocking, but Natasha refuses to wait and see, and when he bites his teeth, he must attack the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien patted her arm secretly and said in the mind line: "Wait again, there is a chance, by then, You run hard to the back, don't look back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to die together?" Natasha's voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "There is still some hope to survive. These two days, the mysterious existence of the dead spirit has been weakened a lot, even love Turner completely released the control and attacked. I also hope that the body will only rot, and the soul can be hidden in the 'immortal throne' magical robe. The extraordinary items are not so easy to decay. You have to rely on you for help. It’s not a big deal for a teacher to change a body.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But...” Natasha seems to want to say something more, because this is just Lucien himself. It is inferred that if the residual power of the debris exceeds his expectations, then the article will decay with the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say it again, this method is much bigger than the hope that you rushed to desperately. Which one is not easy to judge?" Lucien yelled at Natasha. Hesitate, "In my heart, you have always been a hero, you can get rid of your feelings and make a decision." Don't let me down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the road On the face of Xi'an Junxiu, there was a rare sternness. Natasha bit her lip and nodded hard. The silver-purple eyes seemed to be covered with a mist. Then she stepped back a little and stood firmly. On the right hand side of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of conversations was done in the mind connection and didn't take much time, El was not far away, looking at Lucien's left hand:" Waiting to kill you, I have enough time to return to the spirit world before the demigod lich comes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death? Lucian and Natasha looked at him with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El seems to enjoy this kind of gaze, laughing! "You still can't recognize who I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a solid black and white gray flash in each eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El smiled and said: "Aitna's biggest mistake is that I didn't expect that I had already awakened some of the subject consciousness in advance, so I was entangled by the power that I took off. If I was completely absorbed, I would be Back to the phlegm, and my body is good, the power of faith is also very abundant, so that I quickly recovered to the level of the Nine Rings, can not deal with the demigod lich, but it is very easy to deal with you now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, you are all going to die." El mobilized the power of the gods, the holy light was very dazzling, and under the physical isolation, there was no conflict with the mysterious existence of the dead world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above this heavenly mountain power blessing, He is surrounded by the Holy Light, like the true God of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi’s heart sinks and begins to agree with Natasha to run backwards, while communicating with Etna and letting him venture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the sacred voice, the praise sound has become a million times, so that Lucien and Natasha have the feeling of being washed, and El However, he stayed in the same place, could not move, and still maintained a scene of radiant radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to him?" Lucian said to himself inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha shook her head in amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, finally this step." The familiar voice came from the entrance to the Death Valley, and Francis, wearing a plain robe, took six white wings and walked slowly. When I came in, I looked at "El" with a mad look, just like admiring a piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s gaze: “Francis, what did you do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis It seems very gratifying, and Lucian and Natasha don't have the ability to threaten him at this time, so they are quite proud: "According to different prayers, faith gathering, sublimation, surname, on this point, Leviathan you should Already know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Lucien didn't expect Francis to recognize himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis smiled: "I didn't see it, but it doesn't mean that all existence can't be seen. I didn't know it until I was seriously injured a few days ago." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he continued the previous topic: "But, the surname of God is a gathering of countless faiths, representing different souls, representing their strongest desires." Is 普通 普通 普通 ? ? ? ? ? ? 像 像 像 像 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔 埃尔? He seems to have countless people in their minds crying wildly, so for the pseudo-god, the more you go up, the more the power of faith gathers, the more crazy, the more dangerous, few pseudo-god can be promoted to the legend." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what does this have to do with what you do?" Lucien sees Francis calmly, as if he doesn't know that there is a half-god lich to come back, so Ask questions in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s a problem." Francis looked at Eldon with respect: "If a false god has the doctrine of the Lord, the priesthood, the ritual, the prayer, And the believer also completely worships Him as a omnipotent omnipotent like the God of Truth. Do you say that His God's surname will become more and more like the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You also call the Lord, what you do is completely in the Lord." Natasha out of anger and blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis laughed: "How could it be? When his surname is more and more like the Lord, what do you say will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Lucien and Natasha to answer, he turned and said to El, piously: “You are one, also 10,000, is the beginning, It is also the end, it is the moment, and it is eternal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, it seems that the final step of the ceremony was completed, and El’s body broke out with endless light, which will be in the body. The mysterious existence of the dead spirit world is firmly suppressed, and in the sky, the ethereal and ethereal sacred voice is heard. A huge, illusory light group emerges. It is divided into seven layers. The first to fifth layers have the Holy Spirit and angels. Musical instruments, there are joy and serenity, and on the sixth floor, there are six blazing blazing angels, who worship the seventh layer of unspeakable light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paradise Mountain..." Natasha shook her head in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
