			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French’s true feelings, as if he had fallen into his own memories: “Because I study music at night and night while working hard, I put all my heart into creating songs, my body and The spirit is gradually unbearable, health begins to deteriorate, and suffers from frequent illnesses. At ordinary times, attention cannot be concentrated. It is awkward to use neighbors and workers, as if they have not yet woken up from their dreams, like a dead body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They persuaded me to give up music and think that if I continue this way, my body and spirit will collapse completely within five years. Although they all admit my music. My songs are not bad, but I agree that I can't support myself to support my mother, my brothers and sisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hardships of life, The pressure of the environment, the limits of the body and mind, and the intangible burden of the family make it difficult for me to breathe and start to give up the idea of ​​giving up music, because I am not alone, and I have to shoulder many responsibilities."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly choked descriptions have made many successful musicians, as well as hard-working musicians and music students, feel the hardships of their past or experiencing music. The kind of ubiquitous pressure, the kind of exhaustion from the heart, is not difficult to resonate with people who have never had a similar experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they all admit that compared to the difficulties encountered by Franz, everything they face is much easier, so the musicians and music students secretly made up their minds. We must persist in and work hard, and strive to have a chance to remember the past on the stage of the concert with the success of Franz. This is a kind of emotion and a kind of glory! In their minds, Franz has been successful because his piano skills are excellent and his songs are new. He has to admit it, and on the basis of his own strength, he also received a very high evaluation of Mr. Evans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being praised by a top musician means that he has made a name in the music industry and is about to become a real musician, just like being Cristo Mr. Evans praised Mr. Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also very touched by Franz’s experience. If he is not in danger, he will improve his mental strength, make his memory stronger, and his spirit will be full. Then even if there is a soul library, while studying the magic of day and night, I am afraid it is difficult to learn the music foundation. Even if there is such a great music as "The Symphony of Destiny", I dare not come up with a short burst of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Mr. Evans, Mr. Christopher, and Mr. Victor are all slightly squeaky, Franz’s line of sight seems to be a little blurry and continues to be full of affection: “When When I decided to give up the music, my heart was initially relaxed and lost, so I went to the civilian concert hall to listen to a cheap concert as a memorial to the music road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"But I underestimated my love for music. When a sonata, concerto and symphony came out in the hands of the band, I couldn't restrain my sadness and despair. If there is no music, what is the meaning of living? In the pain that made me dying, I chose to get up and walked hard to the door. I didn't want to listen to the melody that was not related to me. I didn't want to hesitate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"When I walked through the aisle in a beautiful melody and stood at the gate, it happened that the symphony ended, and the applause covered the music, which seemed to indicate the end of my musical path. The huge loss hit me. Mind, I turned and silently prayed, mourning poetry, and making a final farewell to the music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French gradually got excited and waved his hands: "Light seems It disappeared completely, and the darkness completely covered my life, but when I dragged the disappointing soul and body back and pushed the door open, Dangdang, the short and powerful and shocking notes suddenly appeared! It seemed to be pounding my heart. Let me feel both fear and an unspeakable shudder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next melody slammed into the rain, and I couldn’t breathe. As if the hardship of life, the poor physical and mental, and the intangible family burden broke out completely, I wanted to destroy me, but in the storm, I heard the cry, heard the firmness of never giving up, and a piece of melody is like a branch. The gun is in the courage to declare the battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I seem to hear Mr. Evans's torture in the music, I was defeated by life, or I chose Yielding? Is life let me Abandon, or did I give up my own music? When faced with difficulties, I was looking for various reasons to make myself weak, or to go forward like a knight, until death, never shrink, never give up?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franz retracted his hands to strengthen his tone, and the voice slowed down: "As the songs I sang as a bard were loved by people, the income grew richer, and many nobles hired me to join their private band and finally let The family has lived a good life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the younger brother and sister become apprentices, with their own life path and the craftsmanship that depends on them, I I left most of my savings to my family and really pursued the dream of music without any burden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his right hand on his chest and bowed with great respect:" And all of this is because of Mr. Evans, without your life philosophy and screaming in the music, I can't find the strength to support myself. You are the mentor of my life, my first real concert can have Your attendance is my greatest pride and glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you again, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The musicians, musicians, and students present here Heart applauded warmly as the tide, both as Franz's insistence, but also to the power of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said with emotion: "The main thing is your own tenacity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Christopher and Victor also commented on Franz's songs, which gave a good evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true affirmation of joy and excitement makes Franz's next symphony completely reveal his own style, although still very young, far away It's not good, but the hopes and expectations contained in the music are as natural as the spring fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When quietly enjoying the Franz Symphony, the auditorium door came in with three ladies, one bright and beautiful, thick lips, one brown, Sweet and delicate, a mature temperament, full of black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis, Elena, and Grace heard that Lucien came back and rushed to the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing Lucien sitting in the first row, the three ladies were relieved and it was him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was keenly insensitive, turned back and smiled at them, and put his index finger on his lips, indicating that they listened to music quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, the aristocratic girl of Felice matured a lot, apparently following Victor’s travels and her own concert experience, she quickly got rid of the tenderness Elena's appearance changed a lot, her long hair was up, the sweetness showed a mature charm, and her face was a little tired; Gris did not have the repressive and proud contradiction of Stewart. A move is very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available for three years, especially for three years around the age of twenty, for ordinary humans, it is enough to forget many people, although Lucien The names often appear in the music world and appear on newspapers, but they still feel a touch of strangeness and estrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also felt it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After Franz’s small concert, Lucien agreed with him the next day to discuss poetry conversion songs, and then with Victor Felice returned to the familiar No. 12 Sneew Street in Jisu District - Victor had a private luncheon and welcomed Lu Xien back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Victor went to tell the housekeeper Mr. Ace, Feili and Elena, who were silent all the way, finally said: "Welcome back, Lucien "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time no see, they suddenly did not know what to look for, what kind of attitude should be used to get along with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans teacher, thank you for your letter." Grace took the opportunity to express her gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw it, smiled and shook his head, talked about his travels and interesting things, and solved the invisible barriers and suppressed atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Felice and Alina began to talk and laugh, and restored some past attitudes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the servant opened the door, and a large and lenient woman ran in a tight skirt and hugged it in. Lucien: "Little Evans, you are finally back! I am also worried that you have encountered robbers, wolves on the road..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
