			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holland, this ancient vampire pinches his throat, wants to talk but can't make a sound, black blood constantly sprang from his mouth, delicate and ** The skin is like a charcoal, which is usually dry and carbonized. The red eyes lose their senses, and the remaining solidified unwilling emotions slowly fall to the ground. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's blood is not sucking, go to the master of deformation, hehe." Klaus licked his mouth and seemed to be for this ancient vampire. IQ is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "In fact, the blood of the master of the deformation is very good, sucking one is equivalent to sucking blood of countless races, but he should not When Elika’s blood became a blazing angel, it seemed that he was desperate for life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do they both comedians?” Elika put away her handkerchief and glanced at the two people who said that the wind was cool, then said to Douglas: "His speaker, when I observed the bookshelf, I suddenly felt the time and space change, then I entered the secret room and met this. Only an ancient vampire, I was worried that I could not solve him in a short time, let him pass the information out. As a result, he seemed very hungry and full of desire for blood, so I changed my blood with the trend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is "local deformation". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time and space changes..." Douglas repeated. "We didn't even notice for the first time. It seems that the Temple of the Dead is indeed guessed by Vicente. Part of the projection of the mysterious existence of the dead spirit, the legendary undead can borrow a little power in the form of controlling the magic array, in order to overcome our induction, then we need to be more cautious to face a kind of god-like attitude!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead, Wissen, nodded and his eyes moved to the ancient vampire body on the ground: "He seems to be one of the legendary dead spirits, how can this be? Stupid? The real vampire is a little more arrogant, arrogant, and IQ is still passing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Normally, the first generation, the ancient vampire is the silver moon The other vampires created by God Aitna are through the form of the first **, and they have absolute obedience to the silver moon. They should not and cannot serve the mysterious existence of the dead world, although they are also undead." En looked at his left hand and said When knowledge of vampires, vampires have just come across this ancient, it does not have any reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando progressed forward and applied magic to check the body: "It is very likely that he is a mysterious existence in the dead world and synthesized in other ways..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the way?" Douglas also walked aside and checked with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead and Klaus followed and walked over, squatting, ** a part of the skin of the ancient vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The skin is delicate, there is a surname, the blood is still flowing slowly, and the death is full of vitality, but there is no power of silver moon." Just like the ****, while doing the evaluation, the voice is filled with fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus East pokes the West button: "Maybe it is because of the synthesis of the day, it caused his IQ to be damaged, even things can not be eaten Is his soul created or merged?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fusion” is the current way of making alchemy life, synthesized with many similar soul fragments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very reasonable to say this, like Mr. Rhein, they are the blood family, they must first completely control the enemy, prepare the knife and fork and wine, after detailed The check before I started to eat." Lucian also came to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are enough!" Elika licked the wound that healed quickly on her neck, slightly annoyed. "This is not an arcane study and discussion." Time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃? A group of research madmen wake up and have a lot of important things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika saw them retreat a little and smiled and said: "In addition, this is my trophy, the body of an ancient vampire is important to a master of deformation. Role, I believe I don't need to say more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the future half of life, you can also rely on the extracted ancient vampire blood source to hold the corresponding magic ceremony . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's move on." Looking at Elika's corpse of the ancient vampire, the soul of the dead soul is somewhat sharp and it seems that I can't wait to meet a similar idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Chamber of Secrets and returning to the library, Lucien and others showed their respective warnings and explorations to prevent the recurrence of the previous incident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a library ban, six people crossed thousands of bookshelves and left the palace from the other end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a calm lake behind the palace, connected to the opposite spire by a black iron bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the realm of the dead, the lake is undoubtedly gray-gray, reflecting the coldness around it, without the slightest wave of light, making people intuitively uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not a lake of wraith, there is a kind of sinful taste." As the negligence of the deceased, the rule of the dead soul distinguishes a little different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas and Fernando also nodded: "Like a demonized necromancer, similar to the Apsius feeling of the Skeleton Wasteland."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apusis, the entrant abyss of the 213th layer of the "Sacred Wasteland", "Life Reaper", "Death Monarch", was once fascinated by the Great Cross Lock seal, the legendary third-order demon king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing the discussion, Lucien and others did not delay and quickly set foot on the Iron Bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the lake suddenly turned up, and a pair of red-red eyes stared at the bridge, and the vitality of those who looked at them would quickly pass away. It soon became an undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the iron bridge, a pair of gray-white hands suddenly came out, scratching the empty road, Lucien and others, these joints are thick, skin No luster, cold and cold, slack and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not close to Lucien’s feet, they are mutated in the faint green light, and there are countless fingers, like the tentacles of the sea monsters. These palms are even stuck together, blocking the reddish eyes below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of result, Lucien is quite surprised, originally wanted to use the "professor's care" to destroy the curse they contain, but unexpectedly there has been such a remarkable variation. The effect, under normal circumstances, will be slightly mutated by the "professional care" long-term exposure - provided that there is no death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of the heart of the ** take-off, Lu Xien exhibition "Douglas flying high-five", the variated gray hand is broken, the life has pulled up more than a dozen Variants, they are heavily wrapped and thrown into the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a layer of vain black at the foot of Douglas. Whether it is a gray-white palm or a red-red eye, it is twisted and turned to the side of Fernando. Faced with the surrounding black storm, it was torn apart and difficult to change. Klaus’s feet did not know what became the feet of the magical couple. No gray hair was scratched, no response, and Elika’s face was pale and innocent. Vitality, I don’t know what has become a high-order undead, smile and look at the red-eyed eyes below. Come on, anyway, I am not dead, but I am afraid to become an undead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼, the soul of the dead dominated Vicente, and the dark red flame slammed, and the faint sense of deterrence spread, letting all the gray-white palms fall on their own, letting red Color eyes are solidified and sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This should be a special arrangement for the living, undead can pass without any influence, not undead, regardless of strength, will be found "The soul of the dead, Vicente whispered, the many traps of the Temple of the Dead have really opened his eyes. This is an arrangement that has never been seen before." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erica is thinking about the metamorphosis mantra, turning Lucien and others into undead creatures, quickly passing the iron bridge and coming to the hall door. outer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of this change is very short, almost the "evil lake" has rolled over two or three times and has returned to normal, without paying any attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front door of the palace is painted with a strange symbol, which symbolizes the sun and looks like a pale eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is getting closer and closer to the soul fireplace, and it is getting easier to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This left eye stuck to the ground gap and sneaked into the palace. Lucien and others observed everything inside through the picture in the crystal ball. , warning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a darkness in the palace. With the advancement of the "mystery eye", there was gradually bright, pale light, and no slight temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the horizon is completely lit up, and the original appearance of the center of the main hall is in front of Lucien and others, and a white robes with magical robes are being held. What magic ritual, on the left is a silver cup, inside is a dark red blood, on the right is a smiling puppet, wrapped in countless reddish-brown spider silk, the front is a blank, it seems nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lich King." Lucien recognized the dead spirit surrounded by crystal clear gems on this head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary third-order undead, the ruler of the outer periphery of the Temple of the Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, the Lich King suddenly raised his head, and the two-pointed red mans looked at the "mystery eye". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Founded!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar ideas were born in Lucien and others, and Douglas read the mantra directly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced time stop! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the silver cup fell to the ground, the blood evaporates, the reddish-brown spider silk on the puppet is broken, and a group of flashing light balls emerge from the front of the Lich King. , turned into countless pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they also stir up time and space, so that advanced time stops are offset! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando, Vicente, Lucien, and Klaus have surrounded from different directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gems in the head are lit up, and the whole person becomes transparent and disappears directly in the place, but there is no fluctuation in the time and space jump! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This?" Elika is puzzled. How could it be so easy to escape under the eyes of others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked around: "It didn't escape, and was hiding somewhere in this hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Lucien nodded in agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are both authoritative in time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, several magicians blocked the two exits separately and began to search carefully and sense the fluctuation of any communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Lucien found a secret door with a sword-like symbol hanging vertically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inspection, Douglas opened the door and revealed a small room that was much brighter than the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chamber is very empty, only five black squats, two on each side, lying on the left, no difference from normal, and the front is placed one vertical Dark black shovel, as if the owner inside wants to stand forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These five cockroaches are not long, the normal person’s height, especially the one standing at the forefront, can be clearly seen, less than two meters, and In the eyes of Lucien wearing "曰之冕", above or in front of them, there is a group of sacred and solemn, hard-to-reach light balls. Each group of light balls has three similar flickering light connections, one from below. The emptiness extends in, and a hollow into the sky, one into the raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The name of the god is shining?" Lucien is not surprised to see this thing here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hidden in the shackles?" Claus wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Douglas suddenly sighed: "Look at the floor, walls, ceiling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
