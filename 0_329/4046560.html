			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf flew like a kite flying toward the rear, a red cardinal robe was ragged, blood in the mouth sprayed like fog, eyes closed, lost perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his face was distorted, and a sacred glow broke out in his body, and four pairs of white wings were woven behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes slowly opened, the pale blue eyes became cold and colorless, with a condescending dignity, indifferently watching Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angel is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian’s astonished voice was introduced to Octave The ear, he couldn't help but smugly and proudly said: "We are the righteous to the Lord, the disciple who truly inherits the will of the Lord. Naturally, angels come to save the power, and your fallen morning star will be purified by us. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks quickly and speaks of the heavenly language contained in the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking back, Octave consciously, with the possession of the angel, his mind is sharp and sober, knowing that this power cannot last, and the two sides fight again. It’s too big to move, it’s easy to attract the attention of the Glorious Cathedral, the Holm Royal Magic Tower, and the Nexus Palace. So behind the wings, countless ethereal dreams float out and gather into a solemn grandeur. Sean went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lu Xien turned into a left-handed right-handed knight, even if he played the strange power of his left hand, he could not break this "holy spirit" in a short time. Octave snorted snoring, no entanglement, a flash flew to the side of Lund, will be hit by the crystal dragon, and he was caught in a mental paralysis, and blocked the dragon by four pairs of wings. The claw attacked, forcibly broke free from the bondage around him and escaped from the "Redemption Cathedral." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings are converging, the light is dissipating, Octave shows his magic, and Lund is integrated into the darkness, quietly going away, he is very clear, Lucien and his "magic pet" can't be chased. If they reveal their possession, they will definitely be regarded as the primary object of erase by Sald, Stone, and other elite cardinals and elite night watchmen. So they must now seize the opportunity to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously changed the whereabouts, Octave showed different traces of magical treatment, and when Lund recovered, he made a special ability to eliminate blood. Covered, this really went to the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous battle stopped in time, did not alarm the big man in the city, so the night is quiet and deep, making people feel quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think I will run into Lucien? Evans..." Lund said with a bitter hatred, only deep in his own strength, not able to kill on the spot. This evil deceit to the extreme devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktafu snorted: "He can only succeed if he is attacking. If they are talking to Richard, and then we will not be able to escape." But pay attention to his left hand, it is very weird, much like your elimination of blood, but it seems to be better in nature, there is a sense of order to suppress my magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Level suppression? Is it a high angel's suppression of the magic? Is it difficult for the road to be the angel, the fallen morning star, the left wing of God?" Lund said, although he and many night watchmen often The fallen angel or the fallen morning star called Lu Xien, but it was not actually taken seriously. It was always thought that it was the interpretation of the Pope’s influence in order to eliminate the influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf was just miserable by the left hand, and there was no refutation of Lund under his heart, but it became silent, and it may be true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unspeakable silence, the two went forward for a while, and Octave whispered: "Wait for the great prophet, he is an angel." The king's coming, with the will of the Lord, to destroy the fallen pope, should know the secrets of Lucien, and when we deal with him in the future, we can be more targeted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Lund gently nodded: "Wait a sin to the great prophet, we have not been able to pull Richard, nor failed to kill him to blame the magician. Yes, the bishop, why do you talk? It’s awkward, a lot of unnecessary things don’t need to be said.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He means that Octave’s mention of the great prophet only needs to say that he is When the king of angels descends, you should know the secrets of Lucien. There is no need to insert a fallen pope in the middle, for fear that he does not know it, but he is also a core member of this secret organization. What do you know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lund understood the nod and didn't say anything more. He turned into a tattered chapel with Oktaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chapel is unexpectedly holy and bright, and it is comparable to the Great Light Hall of the Holy City of Reims. The contrast between inside and outside is not shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Oktaf and Lund did not squint, as if returning to their homes as normal, familiarly walked through the prayer hall and walked toward the confession room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you back?" A young, hard-working young man came over and looked like he was only about thirty years old, but he was wearing a sign last name. Cardinal robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktafu slightly decapitated: "Arthur, the action failed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recognizes This man is the most re-used cardinal around the great prophet. He is also the most gifted pastor of the Holm parish in the past 50 years. He became a cardinal until he was 35 years old. Now he is already a 9th grade. One of the most optimistic candidates for being a pastor of the Holy Spirit, but unfortunately has been excluded from the core of Holm's parish power because it is too radical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur with Holm’s name stunned in amazement: “Failed? You failed to win with three nine-level reels. Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We were going to be successful, but we met Lucien Evans, who should come to lobby Richard." Oak Taff did not know why, did not mention the strangeness of Lucien's left hand, that this is his own and Lund's secret, can only tell the great prophet, "We were attacked by him, and it was caught in a passive, and his magic pet is a The dragon, so we can only rely on the ability of angels to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur's brown eyeballs seem to have a strange color for a moment, he meditated and said: This is an opportunity not to pass on the contact between Lucien Evans and Richard for the time being, which may be beneficial to our future plans, and, in the absence of evidence, Richard’s middle and lower clerics The prestige in the game will not have any good effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rende calmly said: "Arthur, I know what you mean, but this thing can only be decided by the great prophet."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur did not say much, left here and returned to the Rantart Monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf and Lund continued to follow the corridor, and all the way to the seven or eight cardinal level clergy, this is already They are the secret organization of most high-ranking members, and they are also the most radical representatives of the Holm parish, accounting for about a quarter of the high-ranking people of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? How did they come?" Octave looked at Lund, who had developed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lund shook his head and said that he didn’t know: "Maybe there are urgent things to discuss, and we just have the task to go out, wait to see the great prophet." I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocked on the door of the confession room, there was a gentle and clear voice: "Oktafu, Lund, come back? Come in "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Octave and Lund went into the confessional chamber and saluted the great prophet who ended up repenting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confession room is very narrow, and the ordinary candlestick exudes the light that is about to be extinguished, making the interior very dim, the shadows dragging the old, there is a kind of depression and horror a feeling of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great prophet in the white linen robes stood in the shadows, and people could not see his face, only the pair seemed to contain the whole world. The deep eyes attract everyone's attention, as if even the soul will fall into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktafu saw the prophet holding a book in his hand, but he could not hear the name and heard the prophet without a trace of anger: "The mission failed?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Octave and Lund both lowered their heads deeply and then detailed what happened before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has nothing to do with you. It is my fault. I didn't ask for the gods beforehand. I didn't get the revelation of this matter." The prophet said sadly, as if The person who failed was like him, and then his tone became inspiring. "But this shows that our path is correct and no action. The clerics of the parish will be tempted by the evil magicians one by one, the pope and the part. The members of the Cardinal Mission are evil accomplices!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
