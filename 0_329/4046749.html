			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the natural residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Annick, Yurisian, etc. all returned to the tree house, and the magicians such as Katrina and Sprint also hurried back and gathered together. It is convenient for Atlante to protect and see the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of a legendary druid is the most serious thing for the elves in centuries, and it is scary even if the elves are slightly polluted. Therefore, they have to have one more mind and be prepared for all aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that the legendary second-order druid of Lord Ferragand will be projected by the devil ghost. The teacher is not saying that the seven ancient devils are the strongest but legendary. "Hey peak?" Heidi squatted back and forth in the tree house, saying with horror and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick calmly analyzed: "The teacher is also judged from the situation of the data and the devil projection event, and has not really encountered the seven ancient devils, but also ancient If the devil does not exist, he still has to ask a question mark. Maybe they are just the realization of the negative emotions in everyone's mind. Each person has its own personality and belongs to the abstract code, not the concrete object."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary druid is also a life of wisdom, but also has its own joy, troubles, hatred and pain. It is normal to be 'projected' by the emotional devil, and Ferragat is a natural hateful The leader, who has accumulated hundreds of years of hatred, is not surprising in this situation.” Sprint did not witness what happened at the time, so I didn’t think there was any problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians like Katrina also think so, nodding their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is that the investigation of the progress of the matter is too smooth, and the result is too easy, it is not like a legendary plan." Heidi carrying Hands are very good for the senior police detectives of the Holm Kingdom Police Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris looked at himself from the Martha Tree House "Shun" and "Sjing Jingliang Stone", casually said: "Even if it is憎 Devil's possession, Martha's performance is also difficult to qualify. If she is not on her own IQ, it must have a different purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It is the first high-ranking magician in the parliament to deal with ancient devil events. It has a deep understanding of the devil's sinister and singularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Affris, do you mean that Martha deliberately slanded Ferragad? Who is the real mastermind?" Annick looked bright and hoped To Affris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small crystal counts the "Jingjing Liangshi" in his claws over and over again, casually saying: "Martha has already blew himself, how do I know that the mastermind is Who? Ferragad was demonized in the devil, but when the pollution of the elf tree was ruled out, Lan Hill killed him, and the matter was solved satisfactorily, and our mission was successfully completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My trip is also rewarding and perfect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the truth, leave them to Lucien for their troubles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Ellestin, who was not very good-looking, flew in from the outside, and his voice was low: "Thank you for investigating who the mastermind behind the scenes is. Otherwise, if things continue to deteriorate, the entire elf family will be in danger of being destroyed. I have already reported the matter to my mother, and she asked me to convey her thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nothing, Princess Royal, don't worry, Ferragand was seriously injured, and certainly can't escape from Lord Lanhill. When he falls, the pollution of the Elf Tree will be lifted accordingly, and things will get better." Heidi comfort From Elstin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice did not fall, the light green light suddenly appeared on the wooden wall of the tree house, and a little firefly-like light of the same color floated out from it. The tree house is decorated like a fairy tale dream, which makes people feel quiet and clear in the heart. It seems that all negative emotions are naturally eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of surprise sounded one after another, Heidi and Katrina looked out of the tree house, and saw that the whole forest was also flowing with the light green "water waves", and the little light danced to each one. corner. In addition to bringing peace and tranquility, they set the "natural residence" as dreamlike and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a dreamlike scene, Aphrodite's claws danced, trying to capture the fire-like light green spots, while Ellerstin looked at the pure green of the lake, and the troubles on his face disappeared. Authentic: "The pollution of the Elf Tree is ruled out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the natural residence, an elf has forgotten the troubles, dancing in the light and green Next, among them, the elf expression of the natural hateful party is slightly struggling, and the soul seems to have a black air emerging, blending into the void and gathering in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this vain blackness is completely ruled out, they have a relaxed smile on their faces, and it seems that the stone that has been pressed in the heart for a long time has been completely removed. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "prison", the elf who was screaming and screaming gradually calmed down, and as soon as the black gas swelled, pieces of scales fell. The magic pattern on the body is also slowly shrinking, no longer exaggerated to shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They feel the peace of mind, all leaning against the wall, making a silent sob, rejoicing in regaining their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf branches of the sky are stretched and the glow is shining. A little black plaque protrudes from the trunk, and it is dry and peeled off, disappearing inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante sitting in the tree house suddenly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of the elves, as the pupils of the human heart were full of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hidden cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanhill was stunned by the reverse-incorporated magical array, stunned at the other end of the magical array connection, where it should be "The bloody plain", how did it become the "heart of nature"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the black air emerged in the void, gathered in the magic array, concentrated into a drop of liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liquid is dark and dark, and as soon as you see it, it seems to see the deepest and most hesitant hatred, making it difficult to restrain your emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water droplets quickly formed a black figure, and the head turned into an ugly face. No, this face is enough to be beautiful, but it is strong. The greed, hate and other emotions make the muscles twist, the facial features are deformed, and the horrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." After seeing this face, Lanhill made an unbelievable scream, which was originally used by himself for paying Lagunde. Prepare, how did you become yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black silhouette is the "old devil", "abominable" and "greedy" that are brought together by the negative emotions of many elves! However, this time is based on Lanhill as a carrier, as a container! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mixed "Ancient Devil" slammed into Lanhill's body and made him mourn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty, why?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not willing to scream and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After focusing on time and space, "Emperor Queen" and "King of Green" Aglia said calmly: "I am half-fused with the heart of nature. How can you not notice that it has been smothered by someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, impossible! The way I use will definitely circumvent your feelings!" Lan Hill refused to accept and shouted, black figure is working hard with him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferragand returned to God and looked at Agraia if there was nothing like it: "Her Majesty, you have known Lanhill." Conspiracy? Why are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't finish it, and the life of a normal IQ can be seen in Her Majesty's magical array of benefits. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Lanhill heard Ferragad’s question, he also shook his head fiercely: “Why, why not stop me? Why let me hurt the Elf Tree and People? Are you also blinded by greed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
