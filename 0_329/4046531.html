			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black forest that looks far away from the Death Valley and is relatively short in straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha look at the sky covered by dark clouds through layers of leaves, no stars tonight, no silver moon, almost reaching out Not seeing the five fingers, brewing the deepest and deepest fear and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The activity area has been compressed very small, it seems that we have to return to the Death Valley." Natasha leaned behind a big tree, with Lucy Grace, pointing to the sky and sighing, "Quick days, Amir Kamil should have arrived at the Metaning Oasis, but unfortunately it will take a day to wait until the rescue, I wonder if we can see the sun rise?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were probably caught up by Congos one day later, and then killed him, let him spend more than a day and a half reshaping the body from the main substance The world rushed back, and then hid around the death valley for more than half a day. Therefore, the distance from Camille has been more than three days. Even if she counts the recovery time, she should have arrived at the Metanin Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can definitely see the ones together." Lucien had no signs of depression and decadence on his face. The more dangerous he was, the more determined he was. There is a gentle smile full of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is also such a person. After a little sigh, he held the sword tightly, with a strong sense of warfare and strong self-confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and looked at Lucien’s left hand and said: “After the early morning explosion, the mysterious fragments of the dead spirit world should have been controlled by Silver Moon. The frequency of getting out of control is getting lower and lower, maybe the next time will be after one day. If this time can escape from the demigod of the demigod, even if we do nothing, just hiding, he may not be able to find us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the mysterious existence of the dead spirits appeared the biggest out of control so far, not only solidified Lu Xien, but also next to Na Tasha was also affected, so that she had the feeling of having passed the past one or two years. Fortunately, in the real world, the time was only two or three minutes, and there was no other accident. From then on, the interval of losing control became longer and longer. Once in the early hours of the morning, that was the time that the position was exposed, and the two were gradually compressed by Congos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aitna said that she has passed the fiercest counterattack stage, and the next step is to digest the rhythm of the cake, but the mysterious existence of the dead spirit is slightly weaker. Well, even if he has not recovered his consciousness, he can be absorbed by the same level of existence for seven days, and it is very fragile." Lucien expressed his doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha snorted: "Is it weak? If He insists for a few more days, we have to be sent to Confucius as an undead. Etude is definitely better than you in this kind of god-like field. He has no doubts, and it should be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien just wants Answer, only a little light in the Black Forest disappeared and fell into the purest darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hide again, come out, so I will let you sleep after death." Congers seems to be silent in the cold wind. The other side of the forest came, "How long do you think you can hide?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The straight line is less than a kilometer away." Lucien and Natasha I glanced at the tree and quietly left the tree. I began to follow the planned route and returned to the Death Valley. I walked a little along the road to avoid the servant of the mountain full of forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding scenes, living is a scene of "the undead natural disaster." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus sneered: "I know, you still have hope, and the 'deep blue tide' that you want to separate from you has now arrived at the Metaning Oasis. Inform the storm that this old metamorphosis and Hathaway came to the rescue, but do you think I am such a stupid and careless person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is slamming A meal, his face turned slightly white, Amir Camille? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, if Amir Camille has been killed or caught by him, it has already been shown to shake us." Lucien shot Natasha The shoulders are softly comforted by the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care is chaotic, Natasha quickly wakes up, restores perseverance, nods to Lucien and speeds up the return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucine’s face changed slightly and his eyes flickered. Congers had been monitoring himself for more than two months, and he must have arranged everything else. However, it was just a hope that was shattered, not desperate, just like Na. As Tasha said, if he can get rid of him this time, the fragments of the dead will no longer be out of control, and at the same time, they will be able to get a safe situation. When Etna recovers, the identity of chasing and being chased will be replaced. Changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Natasha sighed softly and smiled at Lucien in the mind line: "He did not catch Aunt Camille. Hathaway's mother-in-law, the storm dominated the lord, since I personally entrusted me to look for you in the area controlled by the church, I must have sent a secret liaison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fine, Lucian also had a smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers clearly judged that the two were nearby, so when they swayed with the language, they suddenly turned into gray smoke, which was filled with countless strange mosquitoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mosquitoes are the same color as the smoke, but the head position becomes a distorted face, the illusion is like a soul, they are awkward and noisy. The sound, which led to the gray mist, filled the area of ​​more than 400 meters around. In just a few dozen seconds, the search for this area was completed. Then, the smoke drifted forward and re-covered. A new area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Natasha saw each other, speeding up again, traversing a hidden cave, returning to the vicinity of the Death Valley, dragging out the blur Shadow, hiding in the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗡嗡嗡." The distracting mosquito sound suddenly sounded in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Lucien whispered, and quickly extended his left hand and took the Natasha next to him, his figure flashing and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magician has too many different means, and even found a little ahead of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A green ray hits the original position of the two people in just one second. Stones, dirt, and plants all turn into green spots. There is a huge pothole that is enough to bury dozens of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers made a sneaky laugh: "Catch your two little mice, this time see what little tricks you have to get out of trouble!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s voice has a strong feeling of resentment, and a half-god lich has been killed by two “children” who are not even in the nine-ring ranks. Once, it’s a shame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief teleport into the Death Valley, Lucien and Natasha were all open, and with a bang, they passed the deep darkness toward the advance The area where the arrangement is rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Divine Realm?" Congas did not sneak up this time, but floated over the Death Valley. "Want to join hands with the false gods to deal with me? I want to rely on the gods." The increase and the magic array arranged in advance to weaken and limit me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let's see what is called a magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers will take a trick, seven small meteorites with flames descend from the sky, illuminate the night, straight into the valley of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"X, Direct 'Map Cannon'!" Although Lucien was prepared, he was shocked by Congras's cautiousness and decisiveness. Can't help but burst into a foul mouth, and Natasha is not a "lady" once in the mind connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get rid of it!" Lucien and Natasha rushed to the pre-arranged place, and told the self-controlled erect gods and others. The pseudo-angels evaded, and they faced the artillery shells and shouted a "sleeping down" feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small meteorite almost reached the death valley at the same time, and the layer of magical defense was present, but under the "meteor burst", They quickly smashed and shattered, and by the time the attack was over, the protection of the domain had become ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Congers did not stop, beckon again, and seven meteorites fell at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to have a slight stagnation, then, with a loud bang, a small mushroom cloud rises out of the valley, the smog of smoke makes these hundreds of meters The area has lost its color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
