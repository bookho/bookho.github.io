Ellerdant's cold and disgusting The ground handed Lu Xien two bark-like yellow but elegant paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of "elf paper" is made of bark that is naturally dropped by the elf tree. It is a special product of the elves and is praised by many magicians of the Magic Council. One of the best materials for high-end magic scrolls is comparable to dragon skin, but unfortunately the number is limited, often with no price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two "natural hateful" druids are worthy of being members of the Elf Wang Ting, so they are so wide-minded, they can see the "countryside" Lu Xien Quite a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through two papers branded with magical techniques, Lucien sees the "stereo" mark on it very messy, many of which are missing and scattered. Feeling, there is no balance of mystery in a supernatural power model, so I frown slightly: "Prince Eksilion, Princess Ellerstin, I think these two magical imprints are not complete, since you come to cooperate, It’s best to show sincerity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our sincerity is to destroy cooperation as much as possible!” Ellerd’s heart whispered, then elegantly perfect but cold The smile replied: "Mr. Evans, we are druids, not magicians. The extraordinary power used is from the gift of nature. Only when you have a heart that cares for nature and protects nature can you feel the will of nature. From the memory and construction of the magic model. We have never learned, and will not learn the analytical and drawing knowledge of the magical mark in the future, we can draw it so that we have tried our best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For sister Explain, Exxon is very satisfied, and proudly added: "If you want to see the complete divine imprint, we can directly map the magic with the way of making artifacts, but there is a natural will. Protection can only be destroyed and cannot be resolved. Mr. Evans, can you have the ability to keep the magic mark intact while penetrating the natural barrier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; What he said is the truth, there are many artifacts seized by the Magic Council, which can still be stopped in cracking the mystery of the magic. One of the reasons is that most high-level magicians have no way to stabilize the internal structure of the magical mark when bypassing the magical barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great arcans with this ability, after eliminating the barrier of the gods, found that according to the construction principle of the magic mark, it needs the help of the inexplicable "Power", and this power is temporarily unpredictable, so if the Druids perform the magical cooperation at the crucial moment of the analytical principle, it may be rewarding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has a nine-level sacred item "曰之冕", which has always been mentally in addition to the message of Maskillin. The branding inspired the magic, there is no way to resolve the magical imprint, so after seeing the two Druids do not cooperate with each other, he used a research madman's tone: "Well, then I and Teo Mr. Dole and Mr. Yurian will first analyze this part of the mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Mr. Evans is ready to start, it seems that we have no effect when we stay." We want to go out first, observe the situation of the land and other research groups, and lay a good foundation for our future experiments." Although a little arrogant and impulsive, can not control their own mouth, but was born in the court of Exeter There is still a good talent in the excuse of looking for a grandiose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the gold-rimmed glasses: "No, you need to use your magic for us to observe and sense when analyzing, otherwise we can't continue." Didn't the two cooperate with sincerity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the elves and the "natural hateful" Druid elders issued further orders, Exxon and Ellestin did not dare to say that he did not cooperate with the light, it was to make trouble, it was simply an excuse to give the Magic Council a house arrest, and then the Elf Wang Ting would not take this obvious loss. question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two elves replied sullenly: "Of course we have sincerity to cooperate, but when Mr. Evans analyzes the magic, we have nothing to do, is it sitting like this? Waiting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can sleep, you can pray for natural will, you can whisper, you can read the books I brought, in short, stay here, let me need When I can get the first time, I can get along with it.” Lucien tried to imitate the image of the Arcane Master who was indifferent to the experiment. “If you still feel that you are doing nothing, I have a few beginners number questions here. Do you want to do one?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the thick stack of white paper in Lucien's hand, looking at the numbers that seem to contain infinite mysteries and curses, Exley Lyons and Ellerstin, who relied on the natural will to get the magical mark, suddenly had a head. Swelling, dizziness, feeling of pain, they are the least good at hating math! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'Elemental Order', when you don't study arcane and discuss meat, it's an elegant gentleman who talks humorously. Knowledgeable, handsome, courteous, and good artistic appreciation and quiet and calm temperament, more attractive than many male surnames, but as long as there is meat, there is arcane, he will be his devil-like evil and ruthless It’s completely revealed at the end, and people hate people’s disgust!” Elstin, who had a good sense of Lucien’s senses, secretly regrets that a “gentleman’s watch is different. He hates him for hating a bit of itching. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Exeter and Ellerstin sat in the chair in the corner of the lab surrounded by the Elf Guard, Theodore looked at the complex The magical imprint, and then the "transportation" told Lucien: "I have a headache when I see these models, and the next analysis depends on you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a magic of short-distance communication. It was originally a second ring in the ancient magical empire, but after many simplified improvements by the Arcans, it became an apprentice-level magic, wrapped with special energy to transmit sound waves, and fit within ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the voice of Yulian’s headache was also heard in Lucien by “traveling”, his mathematical basis for the reverse analysis of the magic. It is also very fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handing over the "heavy burden" to Lucien, the two fighting mad magicians pretend to look at the magical mark, the feather pen floating in the hand, but actually They are drawing the winter scenery with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, isn’t it only that I am interpreting magic?" Lucien was deeply "desperate" about this arcane research team, and then took A stack of white papers began to answer the mathematical basic questions of Lavin's layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the last generation did not thoroughly study advanced mathematics, Lucien had a lot of foundations in this regard, just to quickly make up for it with the help of Laven’s guidance. After all, the magical parliament that began to study the complex variable function is equivalent to the level of the earth in the early nineteenth century, and has exceeded the scope of most people's common sense learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of the book in the soul library that has not been unsealed, Lucien is currently only a few of the mathematics knowledge of the Magic Council, such as line surname algebra (matrix), the axiomatization system and the mathematical conjecture that I don't know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world has fully reflected the spirit of serving practice and magic application because of mathematics. Therefore, there are not many studies on number theory and conjecture. Lucien once I thought about waiting for myself to become the top of the Magic Council and then put forward and publish the famous mathematical conjectures one by one, so that the different arcane artists can enjoy a "mathematical meal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, Ellerstin and Exxon looked at Lucien’s serious face, the feather pen that kept moving, and the heart How happy is it: "No matter how serious you are, how can you be genius, in the case of incomplete magical marks, how can you quickly reverse the analysis?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasant feelings of this strategy and the upper hand are fermented in the hearts of the two elves, making them feel that time is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by, Lucien suddenly said: "Prince Eksilion, please show the 'thorns of the thorns'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion’s face is serious, and the three-ring magic is released as quickly as possible. A clump of iron-green bushes appear in the room. The lab floor was quickly wrapped up, making it difficult, and it flashed with light, seemingly piercing the knight's defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I was inspired." Lucien nodded in a blank expression, then turned around and continued to practice mathematics for a while, the road Sean’s request without any emotions sounded again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Princess Ellerd, you are in trouble to show the 'bumpering source'."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wave of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
