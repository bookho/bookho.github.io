			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Golden Trident", the brilliance of the "Azure Key" suddenly softened a lot, as if there was another ocean inside, if there was a loud noise It seems that there is no feeling that the flow is eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "blue door" behind the altar also slightly faded away from the sacred, untouchable "sacred", light-colored light, and the "secret key" Small land shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the entire "Azure Gate" made a hole in a layer of light blue, empty, as true as magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual field that Lucien spread out touched this layer of light blue slightly, and was bounced back like an electric shock, thus connecting with the outside world. cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner heart is slightly sinking, Lucien’s expression becomes dignified, and Hells’s timing is just right, he just triggered the “scoring of the spell” in advance. In the future, if the other magic is removed from the scope of the "Blue Gate", it will be trapped by this strange "enchantment". If he is late for half a second, he has already sent it to Natasha instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dignity is dignified, Lucian has no despair and frustration, although his strength is far worse than the legendary peak, but he must be positive with him. It’s not a big problem to fight against it for a while. As long as it can weaken the "enchantment" during this time, plus the attack of Natasha outside, it is not difficult to get rid of the predicament. After all, I am not alone, and if not this " "The enchantment" looks like a time and space class, and it is solved by a "yang electronic gun"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he can actually mobilize the power of 'Azure Gate', this 'enchantment, can't be underestimated." Lucien secretly snarled, more left hand A morning crystal ball, launched a prophecy, looking for the weakness of the enchantment, at the same time, he read a difficult mantra, "steep turn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since you have to deal with the "enchantment" first, you have to consider the defensive problem in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror with a strange pattern in front of Lucien highlights the passage to another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herkes did not attack immediately, but looked at the "Dark Jellyfish" Tiels in the state transformational array with a slight frown, its body has Completely stained with sneaky darkness, it seems to be squirming and creeping, as if a group of people constantly polluting the surrounding negative emotional aggregates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black line on the aggregate that is almost empty and spreads into a vacuum, which is connected with all the negative emotions in the vicinity. It is impossible to tell who is the subject and who is Projection, like the ubiquitous “probability cloud”, is the only difference that can only be determined after the final contraction. The “dark jellyfish” transformed into this group of things constantly interacts with the surroundings, but there is no sign of contraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not the kind of peculiarity that is constantly shrinking and pervasive in the immortal way. There is no such thing as a transcendental, high-level feeling, and there is a level of the gods. A short journey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so fast?" Helks was slightly surprised, but he had no control and could only judge based on his own experience and keen intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no control over Tilles, and he is in trouble when he adapts to this state." Helkes decided to shift his focus to On the side of the state transition matrix, this is not the reason that he fears and fears to become the state of the ancient devil, but he is worried that he will escape or "suicide" by means of this strange existence, and that his plan of no hidden danger will be defeated. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His deep red indifference eyes deeply saw Lu Xien, who had just displayed the "steep turn", a "golden trident" wave, in front of more A layer of azure blue, completely isolated himself from Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your chance. If you can open the 'blue bondage before I succeed, escape, it means that you are enveloped by luck today, will not die in me. If you wait until I change the state, you still stay here, then don't blame me." Helks's words are long, but under the strange shock caused by his voice, it is a moment that Lu Xi'en understands him. the meaning of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not in a hurry, not affected by the provocation of Heilx, a mind to break the gap between the two to prevent him from switching state, but You are arrogantly performing magic:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you can get out of the "blue door" range, even if Hells has changed state, he can easily retreat with Natasha, and even if Helkels successfully converts, there is still a long way to go from the gods. It is equivalent to the strength of the Speaker of the House of Representatives. It is not a matter of urgency. So why bother to stop and waste precious time here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the empty blue light blew a series of crisp pops under the “luxury cracking”, the water wave swayed violently, but that The "Blue Gate" did not move, leaving the entire enchantment only weak, not completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Direct brute force requires five or six 'luxury big cracks, this time may be enough for Helks to use the 'dark jellyfish to complete the state transition...·· · Lu Xien judged the situation based on the feedback of this offense, so he was ready to display the "luxury cracking" with the "unsure hand" added! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is the case, the mental energy consumption is serious, but with his current strength, it can already be applied dozens of times, in this rushing time. There is no need to worry too much about using it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Heilx suddenly burst into a roar, causing the nearby waters to surge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of Lucien's cast spells slowed down and found unexpected changes on the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hercules was standing in another magical array, ready to use the "dark jellyfish" Tiers to complete the state transition, so that it can achieve the goal, It can also let negative emotions confine on this body, without affecting itself, but at this time, the rune lines connected by the two magical arrays are dyed with pain, despair and greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the group of constantly squirming polymers did not know when they actually crossed the enchantment of the magic array, and rushed to Helks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no sign of such a change, not to say that Heilx is horrified and angry, even Lucien, who is familiar with this state transition, feels inexplicable - although I don't know the unique symbols and patterns of the sea, but according to the overall judgment, it can be confirmed that there will be no situation in which the "Ancient Devil Polymer" can easily escape from the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herkes is horrified, but not flustered, the "golden trident" in his hands shines, layers of waves emerge, it will be The "old devil polymer" that lives in your body is separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Helks, useless, your reaction is good, but it is still a little late, because you are fundamentally wrong. I often warn Everyone, greed will lower the IQ of a strong man, but unfortunately no one believes, hey, similar idiots will appear every day." The dark and creepy "Ancient Devil Polymer" suddenly burst into ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This familiar voice, this familiar sarcasm, let Lucien hold it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord of Hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maldi Moss!" Helks is also no stranger to this voice, angered and snarled, before the calm Suffered a trace of panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he is the legendary peak of the ocean, it is inevitable that there will be a few mistakes when he knows that he has been counted by a genie who has not known for many thousand years. Fear and panic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Hell" Maldi Moss did not hide his identity for this moment of panic, grabbing the emotional loopholes of Helks's mind, the whole dark and creepy The figure penetrated into his body and completed the initial fusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, from the end of mythology, I have been looking for a body that allows me to come to the main material world in a stable manner. Unfortunately, apart from the legendary peaks, even giants The dragon's body can't take on my strength, so I can't always find a chance. Thanks to Vikken for secretly publishing the way to transform into an ancient devil. Thank you guys who have been blinded by greed and sensible to let me miss the opportunity. It is also difficult, hey, who knows the ancient devil, who can compare with me?” Maldi Moss constantly used his ironic and ridiculous words to influence Helkex’s inner feelings and strive to invade as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Helks forcibly suppressed the emotional fluctuations in his heart and did not hesitate to let the "blue key" on the "Golden Trident" burst out. Unbelievable bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
