			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a diagonally downward, long, wide dark black stone ramp inside the cave, and the surrounding stone walls are inlaid every ten meters. There is a copper lamp, but most of them are not lit up, and occasionally a few faint yellow lights will make the road pale and gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien entered the martyr, he quickly and calmly ducked into the dim corner, mixed into the shadows, almost stunned, without footsteps, stunned toward the front. Go ahead quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the temple, another high priest wrapped in silver robes is checking the other entrances and exits in turn, fearing that it is a man-made coincidence, some people will Sneak in from other entrances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance here is because of the place where the fierce battle took place, and there is Angela outside, so the high priest is subconsciously neglected, thinks safe, put To the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a deliberate use of blind spots! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After ten seconds, the ramp became flat, and there were quite a few old and broken doors on the stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding in the dim outside a door, Lucian did not use the "bat scream" to investigate, but concentrated, becoming more acute Hearing listens to the movements inside, because he is worried about the magical array, the magical array, etc. that monitor the large magical fluctuations in this underground palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No breathing, no conversation, no action." Lu Xien used feedback to judge that there was no one inside. After all, the battle outside was fierce. If there is someone in the place where the silver horn cult is hiding, or if there are strange creatures that do not need to breathe, it will never be so quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand held the door handle and gently applied, the door slowly opened, and Lucien quickly swept the inside with his eyes and flashed into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this time, Lucien was relieved a little, the tension, depression, fear of being discovered by the high-ranking strong, finally eased a bit, or else Sean suspected that he would suffocate unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that in this underground city, most of the powerful cults have been transferred out to fight, but they have not gone out, and they are basically guarded in key places. En, Uncle Joel, their family is a poor, and they should be held in a tight position." Lucien understood that his initial plan was successful. "But there is really a relic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious from the many rotten furniture in the room that this is an underground relic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calculating that the cultist was hiding 100 meters near the forester’s hut, Lucien guessed that there might be underground ruins or underground caves, both of which have a percentage The possibility of fifty, so the "Emden" magic remains is not a casual nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief adjustment, Lucien opened the door again and continued to go deep into the road. It was urgent, and the strength of the cultists occupied an absolute advantage. I believe that it will take a long time to end the battle and return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lurking in the martyrdom, Lucien relies on past traces to determine where is the core, while looking for cultists in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to three houses in a row, Lucien finally heard the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a somewhat old-fashioned door, two people are talking nervously:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What happened outside? How many dignitaries have gone out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but I can hear the explosion outside is very loud... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien judged the strength of the two, gently twisted the door, slammed into it, and turned into a residual image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cultists are worried about the situation outside. They did not expect that they would be in danger. They were directly stunned by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the wooden door, Lu Xien wakes up one of the young cultists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cultist just woke up and remembered the experience just now, he had to ask for help aloud, but there was a pair of deep eyes in front of his eyes, which seemed to be shining with stars. Fantasy starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know where the poor people who were arrested are locked?" Lucine asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Star of the Eyes" used in this way is equivalent to hypnotism, basically no magical fluctuations, more direct mental and spiritual strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "communication" with the cultists, Lucien mastered the general situation of this ruins, in the west of the ruins is the core temple, where there is a high priest, The priests, the priests, and the dark knights, and the Joel family and other ordinary hostages were held in a remote room in the northwest of the ruins, guarded by an ordinary dark knight with several knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this ruin has more than one floor, but the following layers have been completely destroyed, and there are five exits on this floor, respectively in the Melzer Black Forest. Different places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t dare to delay, Lucien twisted the two cultists around their necks, then left the stone house, bypassing the core of the remains, toward The northwest direction sneaked silently and quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The silver robes in the temple check the other entrances, begin to display the sorcerer, check the entrance where there should be no problem, and at the same time command the left behind The priests, priests, and dark knights focused on examining the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Because of the topography of this ruins, Lucien is still cautious, but the hidden tension has disappeared a lot, more calm and more Freely moving forward, and most of the cultists with strength in the ruins have already gone out, so they quickly reached the "Jailhouse" position provided by cult believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large, remote room, separated by two iron rails, and the innermost is divided into seven or eight cabins, each holding different hostages, traitors Wait, while the outer part is hung with a lot of torture tools, and the four physically strong knights walk around uneasy and discuss the outside world from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man wearing a black leather armor and a little distorted face due to long-term negative emotions is sitting on a wooden bench and staring fiercely at the iron railing The room inside the "Prisoner" seems to be able to see the situation inside through the closed iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent noise is still coming, and although the battle outside has eased a lot, it can continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the old man of the Dark Knight, he suddenly stood up and said with deep anger: "Get the two guys who have broken their fingers, I have to be good." Punish them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the shadows, hiding and quietly listening to the movement inside Lucian, "He refers to Uncle Joel and Eliza. Amoy them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the knights hurriedly dissuaded: "Master Jensen, before the success, can't let them die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, but my mood is very bad now, I need to vent, and they are the most troublesome prisoners. It’s too awful to take them out every other day or two. It’s too It’s annoying! I just taught them!” Jensen said violently because of the outside fight. “Tim, if you don’t want to, then you will replace them!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knight attendants know that Jensen’s relationship with the blood is very irritating and very irritating. One, not stop, he took out the key, opened the iron railings and gates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." Joel woke up in a groggy way, and the torture of this time made them slow to react to the outside world, even the fierce battle on the ground. Did not find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim kicked his foot on Joel and kicked Eliza away: "Master Jensen will interrogate you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he opened his body and let Joel and Eliza worry and fear to go out. The awake Ai Wen glanced at the scene with a toothache, no crying, no noise. It is much maturer than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go faster." Tim kicked Joel again and let him stumble and run out of the iron railing, almost in front of Jensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen picked up the whip on the torturer's arm and slammed it on Joel's back: "You guys, low-lying bastards, why bother me? Damn, really damn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
