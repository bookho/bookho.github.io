			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh la la la, the downpour is like a waterfall that falls down in the sky, the sky becomes dark and depressed, looking at the white mist that splashes outside the hall, making people feel alive The illusion of being abandoned by the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rain of the fire is really no sign." In the banquet hall, Drummond stood by the window and watched the rain, the cup was dark. The red wine was slightly shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella wearing a crystal crown heard his sigh, contrasting the warm and soft atmosphere in the hall with the ridiculous darkness outside, smiling slightly: "The power of nature is much stronger than our magic. Unless it is the lord of the legendary field, it can rid the weather of such a wide range and create such a terrible scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Lightning thunder and storms will always calm down, just like the obstacles we face, regardless of the ancient magic theory of inheritance, or the church of strong horror, will eventually be defeated by arcane and magic. Destiny is like a huge The wheel, which rolls forward, will be crushed into a meat sauce, and the one that cannot keep up is destined to be abandoned forever. I like the weather after the rain, it is so fresh and beautiful, it seems to be stained with dirt. The world has been carefully cleaned up and re-established a new world.” Drummond said with some enthusiasm, the outside was thundering and the rain was pouring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Around Aringe, thunderclouds are dense, lightning is dancing, the bright sunshine is replaced by black and black, and the harmony of Rantat is not far away. The beautiful scene is in stark contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not think that the anger and roar of an archer would cause such a terrible change in the sky, and the surrounding air became confined On the body, let yourself have a feeling of not being able to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is not continuous?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is not continuous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s roar is ringing in the ear, more intense than the roaring thunder outside:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is only a hypothesis that this formula is established, it is just a hypothesis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storm" rushed to the surface, Lucien did not bow, facing the like The pressure, slow and calm, but calmly and firmly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is only a hypothesis, at least it is the only assumption so far!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are countless thunders ringing at the same time, and Fernando’s eyes sparkle with dazzling silver and white lights:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The only assumption? Do you dare to rule out everything else now? Is there a strict derivation? Is there an experiment? Is there a magical verification?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien's black pupil is as deep as a lake, and is not affected by roaring and storms: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the time of work, at least other The analysis of the angle has been rejected. If it is assumed that this inference is correct, is there any tangible evidence and deduction to overthrow it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work during this time is two Discussing together the study, the veto explained by different angles is recognized by Fernando himself, and the difficult overcoming is also his personal experience. Under such a premise, he could not deny the words of Lucien, and his heart began to waver. He could only growl::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evidence, the whole world is evidence ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly smiled, gentle and peaceful: "Teacher, the essence of the world is profoundly mysterious, what we see, hear, feel Is it limited to itself, does the ordinary arcian and the Arcanist have the same view of the world? Are the Arcanists who support particle theory and wave theory the same in the world? And this formula is real, not Before we find other explanations, we have to accept such assumptions for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you have told me a word, sometimes, past experience and Knowledge is a hindrance to our progress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, it is only a hypothesis for the time being. I will continue this work and look for explanations from other angles." Fernando sighed softly, and the voice revealed a bit of old age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he seems to have received signs, Lucien asked with concern: "Teacher, are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately, it is only a hypothesis for the time being." Fernando repeated this sentence. "If you have this irresistible evidence support when you make this hypothesis, then I have now become a real one." The storm, the flesh and blood storm, of course, may also be the cognitive world breaking and solidifying, and the possibility of continuing to improve in magic becomes extremely low."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now Given that it is still only a hypothesis, I still have time to buffer. Finding other angles of explanation to refute it is itself a process of slowly changing acceptance. Of course, during this time our discussion made me understand that no new theory emerged. Before, the meaning of a complete explanation of this formula from another angle may be very small. Oh, perhaps the new theory is based on your assumptions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Teacher, energy discontinuity, quantization is just one At the beginning, on this road, there is a "devil" that is more horrible than it is, and it is a subversion of common sense. Even Einstein, one of the greatest scientists on the planet, "cognizes that the world is broken and solidified. No further progress." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words, Lucien is naturally impossible to say, the road to the world is always so cruel and incredible, but see Fernando is still stable, and even After making a joke, Lucien finally sighed quietly, and he didn't want to explode the teacher's head. Especially, no magician below the legend tried a legend in front of him because his world collapsed and his head exploded. No one. Know what power it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe like those middle-level and high-ranking arcans, sitting in a chair and bursting out, at most, soiling other people’s bodies, maybe It is to annihilate everything in a certain range of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Fernando sighed again, unlike the harsh and violent storm, but like the old man of the coveted year: "I can’t wait for myself to never do it. Experiments on superheated radiation have never produced this idea, but everything can't be reversed. We may have released a horrible monster that can destroy the arcane system, the magic parliament, and even the whole world. Before today, I never thought about energy. It may be discontinuous, the world may be discontinuous, like a piece of picture patchwork. What kind of reaction do you think other magicians will see when they see the meaning and premise of this formula?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more vivid statement is that the whole world is like a movie. It is not continuous, but frame by frame. Lucien is used to correct the surname and then smiles. "The vast majority of them will feel trepidation, and then comfort themselves. This is a hypothesis. Finally, the subconscious mind ignores this problem, simply using the formula, and a small number of people will be angry and will refute the accusation. ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You understand, the submission of this paper, and how to throw it, you have to discuss it, although it is only a hypothesis, but also try to Relieving its impact. It’s a hypothesis of subverting surnames.” Fernando regained his serious appearance. “You sent today’s work into a paper form and sent it to Douglas. He is probably the most basic arcane master who can accept your hypothesis. Hey, energy is not continuous, but a share, not like a particle? Well, it is called quantum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for Hathaway they The paper divides the upper and lower parts, allowing them to buffer more than one day. Sometimes, what they think of is more acceptable than what others have told, at least the situation I have just confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Fernando’s instructions, Lucian wrote the paper. When I was about to sign, Fernando, who was leaning against the back of the chair, suddenly sat up straight and solemnly said: "The author of the paper writes one of your own, and I retreat when I assume it. This result belongs to you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." Lucian looked at him with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s eyes: “Just follow my instructions, I don’t want to sign on a paper that I don’t want to admit.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending the letter, Fernando closed his eyes and calmly recognized the world, and thought about the interpretation of formulas from other angles, and the whole room became quiet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also adjusting his status. He did not feel that he had no intention of it before. It is only now that he has discovered that in the face of the terrorist pressure of the storm, he has already Out of a cold sweat, the heart jumped out of the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
