			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Philosopher from the Eastern Kingdom?" Jacob, the first disciple, looked at Francis in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not skeptical that this strange man has problems, can pass the test of "Flame and Destruction God" Afando, and get the trust of "crown" El. As a devout believer, he dare not and will not doubt. The reason why he speaks is to learn more information in order to make a reasonable judgment on Francis's suggestion. After all, he is the main leader of the secular missionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob's attitude represents a similar idea of ​​other disciples, and even Lucien is the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world is special, there are many false gods, and there are not a few 'God's in the moon," then the god of the silver moon, Aitna, falls into the world. It is also possible to try to 'absorb' them to restore their own ranks by the similarity of 'the surname of the gods'. After all, he is still the ancestor of the blood family, absorbing blood and the surname of the gods is a hidden ability." For the study of the realm of the gods, the magic parliament is at To the extent that it is backward, the words used by Lucian are basically from the church "ship". What kind of priesthood, the surname of God, can only understand what they mean, but can't figure out what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this premise, Lucien swears: "In the absence of other better ways to find Silver Moon Aitna, control and attention to the moon. The false god of 'God' is an effective method of 'waiting for the rabbit'. Is Francis a Southern church, a church in the north, or a church from the northwest of the Dark Mountain? Hey, really, the parliament, the dark council, etc. The forces can also help to make similar religious improvements - every day, when you hear it, if you don't know it, it's harder, but the more stubborn elves, the druids will not do this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mature religious concept mentioned by El, walking the path of redemption and appeasement of the soul, Lucien himself can also be a seven-eighth-eighth, can not determine the identity of Francis, and if he is a church Helping the false gods to carry out religious reforms seems to violate their own beliefs. Of course, in the face of the number one event of Yinyue Aitna, it is slightly contrary to the beliefs. For the church officials and night watchers, it is not necessary to test. Thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien is more alert and cautious, most of his magical items are in a state of damage to be repaired, which is not conducive to a long battle, and still do not know Francis has no companions nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El smiles pointing to Francis: "Mr. Francis is from the oasis in the east desert, and has a profound study of philosophy, theology, and occultism. To the Eldo Peninsula, because he watched the astrology at night, he found that a star became very shiny in a short time, and then quickly calmed down, corresponding to the rise of the Father, so he came to worship and communicate specially."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This god stick... Lucien cursed in a secret way, and felt that Francis had a problem. The star phase change described is obviously the "old god" fallen, the new god is in the throne. The symbol, what does Afan take to rise? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not understand the astrology, make up indiscriminately, or deliberately ridicule Afando and El ignorance, illiterate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis sat freely on a silver chair, and looked at the disciples with a smile that never faded: "Great Flame" And the god of destruction is no longer worshipped by the Babuls as before, except for the purely intimidating and intimidating way of preaching, it is also that he was indeed defeated by Anantans, letting fear of his horror and powerful Babur The man found that the god of fire and destruction seemed to be weaker than they thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is due to the betrayal of other gods!" The second disciple sang, Afando, the god of fire who refuses to admit the destruction of the world, will fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis leaned back on the back of the chair: "No matter what, He failed. For the gods, failure is more tragic than depravity, therefore, I It is suggested that the great Afando temporarily give up the image of the past and preach in the way of the new god. We can say that in the flame of destruction, the salvation of El is born. The previous failure is only the test of the great Afando to the believers. Those who fail the test must be pious and repentant in order to receive El's redemption and gain in the fertile land after the flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one A new god, 'God of Resurrection, Fertility and Redemption', will later gradually absorb the image of 'Afando', add flames and destroy the priesthood, and let the believers understand that El is Afando, Fan Duo is El, and they are two in one, so that they can become truly powerful gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six disciples at the round table became silent, and the words of Francis sounded reasonable, but whatever can be explained by the test of God seems to be a mockery of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien noticed that when he said these words, Francis’ expressions and eyes were not only without a hint of ridicule, but rather a bit of enthusiasm, which made people very convinced. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is he really acting, or is he looking for a silver moon?" Lucien is more and more sure that Francis is the main material world. "visitor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the disciples were still silent, Francis stood up and saluted El according to his chest:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meaning of the gods is that we can't really understand what we can't really understand. It's not enough for us to understand and ignore the test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods are unchanged, they have their own Forever, we don't need our faith, but we need to believe in the gods and get redemption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gods represent the good things of truth, virtue, redemption, and ownership. In addition to Him, there is no real God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing these words, El's look became slightly excited, and the flames of both eyes beat even more. The teachings of Francis's changes are much more obvious than the previous high-end ideology. The "Smith" of his own is greatly improved. It is no longer similar to those false gods that are mixed between mortals. It is also more convenient for believers to worship wholeheartedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this the theological interpretation of the latest version of the Church of Truth?" Lucien had the feeling of dripping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Truth requires to pay attention to the progress of the Arcane research, and the Arcane Masters also know more or less theological knowledge and understand the enemy's situation for better Conquer them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Lucien could not guess the identity of Francis. In all cases, the truth of the gods may become the smallest, and it will be The doctrine is used in the false gods, even if the pope is accused of being degraded unless he has other purposes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great "resurrection, abundance, and the god of redemption", please accept our faith, forgive our sins, and save us from the filth of the world." As the old-fashioned gods, each of them reacted first, and quickly rushed to El, and led other disciples to accept the new identity of the "God of Fire and Destruction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aer is satisfied with letting them sit down: "My priesthood is derived from the surname of the Father, and is still very weak. It is necessary to conquer other false gods and obtain God." The surname comes to grow up, and the name of the god of the god Ashin is immortal, gestating, quiet, and so on. It has a very close relationship with resurrection, abundance, and redemption, so our first goal is him."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El changed Axin’s pronoun from him to him, that is, he no longer regarded him as a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axin was betrayed in the war against the evil god Anantans and gained some autonomy. He is now free to preach in the Solna Valley and Other gods who have betrayed the great Afando are vying for limited resources of faith. But they are always worried about the revenge of the great Afando, the position of the gods becomes more secretive, and if there is a battle with him in the gods, even if there is a 'resurrection, The god of fertility and redemption 'you take it, we don't have much confidence.” An Hughes often preached outside and knew something about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw that they did not shy away from the thirst for faith resources, and more doubted the source of the magic: "If the magic does come from the power of faith, Does that represent the existence of the power of the mind, or the power of the mind is a more special spiritual power, the frequency is more peculiar spiritual power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis has long Ready to smile: "So the new 'Resurrection, abundance and the god of redemption' can effectively reduce the alertness of Luna, and when I came, I heard that the Solna Valley will hold a 'theological conference' and debate each The power of the gods attracts the believers, the losers will be driven out of the valley, and the priests of the evil god Anantans will also go to try to make these false gods truly become members of the Angloma."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We sent two disciples to participate in the name of the new religion, angered Ashin in the theological debate, and then led him to the ambush position."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El gently nodded: "This thing follows Mr. Francis's safety. To do, when I, Mr. Francis, Jacob together, outside the domain of God can easily kill Asin "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
