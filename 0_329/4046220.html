			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucian’s testimony, most of the arcane masters on the stage were first stunned, and then they showed their smiles and they clapped their hands. Decent and modest words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he can discharge the periodic table of elements in front of the arcans in all elemental fields, it is a fact that "seeing farther" is true, there is nothing worth blaming, But he compared all the arcane masters who studied the regularity of the elements to the giants, and regarded himself as an ordinary person standing on the shoulders of the giants to see farther. The implicit compliments and modesty would have to make people feel good. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially Lavindi, Ulysses and other artisans who have studied the law of the elements have a happy smile on their faces, at least they are waiting for others. The study of the periodicity of the elemental cycle does not take a lot of effort, but lays a solid and towering foundation for later generations to find the correct law, so that he can get closer to the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Elegant, modest, relevant, easy to understand, this sentence will become a famous saying, spread throughout the world.” Timothy applauded and sideways Larry said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry touched his chin: "This is the Holm Crown Award, even with Evans, two hundred and seventy years is only twenty-six Individual awards, no matter what Evans said, will definitely go down in history, but if it is so elegant, it will make his personality charm more radiant, and let others pass on, maybe even inspire those poets Inspiration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Larry, your teacher, Mr. Gaston, said that Evans became a famous arcane master, the first morning of the meeting. Things will become beautiful talks. Unexpectedly, he realized his wishes. In the beautiful talks, you and I seem to be less glorious clowns." Timothy is jokingly joking, there is no such thing. Mindly, he and Felipe are both people who are very confident in themselves. For the time being, they will not hate because of the success of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he looked at Lucien on the stage, listening to the applause around him, his heart was a strong desire, why can't he hope the Holm Crown Award What? Why can't you enjoy the highest honor in the elemental field? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s young, Lucien’s time to learn arcane, Lu Xi’s modest and elegant words, and the sudden award of the Holm Crown Award, Let most of the ambitious arcane masters be motivated by a little envy and envy. Want to be successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pair of cold and ruthless eyes couldn’t help but think: "This is a modest word, but it seems to have hidden meaning on the shoulders of giants. Are you paying tribute to his teacher 'Professor'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the smiles of everyone or longing or contempt, heard their warm applause, my heart was slightly Shaking their heads, they will never think of their true tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lucien pressed his right hand and continued: "There are no ten questions of Lord Douglas to begin the process of magicians exploring the world, me and Everyone can't be here; no one in the magical field of elemental elements explores the essence of elements is a variety of atoms, we can't start the current real elemental research; without them inventing and introducing new methods, without them Discovering more and more new elements, the exploration of the periodicity of the elements will have no clue, like a house without foundations; without ladies, gentlemen, your research in this field, then I will not be able to find the right idea." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then at the beginning of the "famous words", Lucien expressed his gratitude in memory, ushered in more heated applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we stand on the shoulders of giants, not to enjoy glory here, but to look farther and explore deeper."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recalling, nature is the outlook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As I said that day, the most pressing issue now before us is not to use the periodic table to find more elements, but to calm down. Think about why there is a cyclical pattern between elements? I have a hunch that exploration of it will make elemental magic closer to the essence of the world, closer to the truth, and create a storm that sweeps the world."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And where do we start? I think everyone noticed the most obvious problem in my periodic table, why the atomic quantities of those elements are not in line with the data inferred from the periodic table. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar stood in the corner, watching Lu Xi's grace on the stage, confident and elegant, talking and talking, not like the first time facing many beginners of the Arcane Division, but reminded him of something similar. Lectures by masters at the Magic Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master of the music industry refers to the symbol of Christopher’s era. The field stands on the authority of the peak, and the master of the magic world can only be the Great Olympics. The master, the legendary magician without this title, can't convincingly call them masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca next to Lazar is beautiful, and men with strength and temperament are always full of charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw most of the arcane masters nodding their heads about their own prospects, and smiled: "Why are there errors in their atomic weight? I have a conjecture. Except for the atomic weight and the few surnames involved in atomic weight, most of their surnames are inferred in accordance with the law of the periodicity of the elements. Is it possible to think that they are not pure enough to be mixed with substances that affect the determination of atomic mass, and these impurities Without affecting their other surnames, it is difficult to separate them by conventional means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And want to purify, I think it can be different from the atomic weight of these impurities and the elements themselves. Come and start, that is, their quality and other aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Olympics including Larry, Timothy and Ulysses The surgeons are all stunned. Lucien is telling himself and others directly about his inspiration and conjecture. Isn’t he afraid of robbing him in front of him and solving this problem that has blinded all the arcians for hundreds of years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucian’s inference is so reasonable and does not involve deep knowledge of arcane, just logical guesses seem to find the way to solve the problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a keen thinking! It has been several days since the periodic table was expelled from him, and he and others have no clue in solving the atomic errors of those elements. They are still racking their brains to analyze the problems and loopholes in the past measurements! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to this line of thinking, it seems that you can really develop new ways to purify elements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As if it was blown by a fierce thinking storm, the arcanes were so shocked that the sound of the cymbals kept coming, and that was the sound of the feather pens in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a high-level Arcanist like Gaston, you can’t help but look at Lucien, and tighten the quill in his hand, Raven And Morris is even more frowning, as if he has been designing magic arrays or new magic in accordance with this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sounds bigger:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this regard, my arcane knowledge is still Very lacking, we can't design the corresponding magic array and alchemy array. I hope everyone can discuss together and explore new directions in the field of elemental magic, and become the giants that the latecomers look up to and can use! Push the elemental magic to a new peak! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Lucien pressed his right hand on his forehead and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See him thank you, the Arcanists have come back from the shock of the shock, the applause is no longer gentle, very crazy, almost overturned The roof, for Lucian's keen thinking, but also for his selfless sharing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause did not stop for a long time, Morris raised his hand three times in a row to suppress it, then he turned his head and smiled and looked at Lucien: "This kind of inspiration and ideas The idea, you will share it, if it is really successful, it will be another achievement that may win the Holm Crown Award. Do you really feel a pity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing Morris and Natasha have a two-pointed silhouette, Lucian smiled and replied: "In fact, even if I don't share it, I believe that in the next study of the periodic table, there will definitely be a sharp sense of the Arcanist. I think of this question. I have always admired your wisdom and wisdom. Since I have no ability to study for a while, why not share it and make myself a 'giant'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;And alone, I can’t completely open the new field of elemental magic. Only when everyone studies and explores together can the magical world be presented to us, there will be countless achievements, For me, definitely better than the present More and better opportunities, Hello, everyone is really good! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
