			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting the spirit of the road, the Natasha suddenly whispered: "I have been implicated before you have really taken the girl's hand." In such a dangerous battle, I am really sorry. Lucien, I will introduce you to a good girl in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...this time Please don't say this kind of thing." Lucien sighed helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing Natasha quickly adjusted her status and jokes, Lucien was more assured. She is the only five-level knight on this side. The key to breaking out is not her own but her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned to look at the other three and asked seriously: "Yacah Knight, Daniel Knight, Posh Knight, why are you?" Staying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yaxia is not very beautiful in the bloody aristocrats, linen hair and eyes are ordinary, but elegant and generous, temperament is outstanding. He pointed to the heart of his left side: "My heart told me that it is vigorously beating, it is not the heart of a coward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am from the poor After becoming a knight, I was addicted to the privilege and glory of the nobility. I have made many mistakes, and some can even go to the gallows. But I have never changed the belief of fighting evil!” Daniel is a middle-aged man with a pair. The gray eyes with the indifference and indifference, he painted the cross on his chest: "Maybe I will go to the end of my life, please allow me to make a remorse to those who have been hurt by me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming the official knight, Bocht, who was a bit green, scratched his black hair, and the light green eyes showed a firm look: "I don't want to be the first game after the Cavaliers." The official battle is surrender, I don't want to be laughed at by my little Yawei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to Yawei, Bochette's expression is gentle and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing his own knight, Natasha looked at the two remaining knights intently: "Bright, Tildo, all the attendants And the soldiers have run away, only you choose to stay? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tildo is a half-elf, looks beautiful and beautiful, she swallowed: "Actually, In fact, I think they will definitely kill the surrender, and only the dead can keep the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you, you remember my name." Brett was very excited. "I had the same worry as Tildo, but now I want to fight for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdi does not have a nata Sha asked the Cavaliers and the Cavaliers to attack when they were obedient. They just watched her talking quietly. I wondered if I wanted to start fighting with the grace and spirit of the Cavaliers, or wait for more powerful changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he heard the language of the two attendants and sternly retorted: "There are so many knights, servants and soldiers who follow me, can I Kill them? As long as there is no evidence that I am colluding with the devil, the magician, and the support of the majority of the nobility of the Principality, the church will never punish me. The moderate assassination, intrusion and civil strife between the nobles is the pleasure of the church. Seeing and defaulting, can the Gusta Empire's inability to control the major lords still explain what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to have figured out a lot of things, shaking his head and smiling "Dear cousin, if you don't understand why the Magic Council sent someone to assassinate me, then you don't know how much the church pays attention to 'I'. Even if you kill me, the blood of the Violet is not only you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silence of Verdi's astonishment, Natasha once again looked at the seven "Knights" around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Lucien's terrible calm, Wyan, Yakasha, and others have clearly defined the reasons for their stay through their own explanations. , more and more determined, full of fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles, his expression becomes firm and hard, his right hand presses on his left chest, his voice is magnified, and his passion is ridiculous:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My knights, although their knights are more than us, the strength is stronger than us, but in order to prevent us from escaping, they are scattered around. Our positive impact needs to face only than us. A little more enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the other knights are surrounded, killing the enemies blocked by the front, we will win!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victory!" "Victory!" "Victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well sees that this has begun to mobilize, no longer waiting for the arrival of the Knight or the High Supreme Master Waved around the knights to drive the horses, and began to oppress from slow to fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned and faced Verdi, where there were two five-level knights and four knights, the strongest part of the encirclement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her three-meter-long rifle "slaughter" in her right hand and sandwiched it between her arms, while her left hand shook her own knight's sword "Nata "The thunder of Shake", shouted: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knights of the Violet family, known for their heroism, always kill the enemy positively!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very strong and a little excited. It seems that she has long dreamed of such a place as a magician with calm focus as the primary premise. Lucien is a bit unbelievable and open her mouth. At this time, Tasha still thought of a positive charge to defeat Verdi? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other knights have become excited, trying to face positive assaults in the desperate, fighting enemies, very knightly and heroic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha continues to shout:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My knight's creed is to move forward, forward, forever Go forward and face all obstacles!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a man who kills them positively!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "For the glory of the Violet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A black-legged horse "Agatha" with a pair of legs, Natasha rushed out first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the glory of the Violet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second row of Yacaxia, Lucy En and Wyan, the third row of Daniel, Tildo, Brett, and Bocht shouted out and rushed out. There was no such thing as Lucien’s bloody sacrifice for the glory, but only the attention. Put on the sword and watch the sword, and be ready to stimulate the "曰". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall black mare "Agatha" has two black viscous breaths on his nostrils, which erodes a running road. Traces of the streaks, the dragon scales on the body all bulged out, as if the dragons breathed, the four horseshoes trampled on the ground, and the hooves were clear and loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien rides a common red dragon scale horse that was thrown away by the Cavaliers when he fled, followed by Natasha, on the left is Yacaxia. On the right is Wyan, the hooves heard in the ears are noisy, only eight people have the feeling of a thousand horses and horses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the speed of the charge getting faster and faster, Natasha’s “slaughter” has a large amount of black-lined hedging gas in front of the gunpoint. People are wrapped in it, as if she had pierced the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well was serious but not flustered, and the knights neatly took out the standard devil's longbow and shot nearly a hundred arrows toward Lucien and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each long arrow flies out, you can still see their twinkling cold light, which is extraordinarily dazzling and fierce in the dark night. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These arrows only broke into the black line-like gas, and there was no damage to the knights of the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildi is not disappointed, with a wave of hand, the knights are in an orderly way to separate from the knights. "Knights behind Tasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the left, back, and right of the Natasha, the great knights are moving closer, Verdi Jean Silvi After Yat retired, she held a giant iron black shield and waved a long sword flowing with flames to meet Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by his side, another five-level knight, Todd of "Steel Blood" also carries his own silver-white rifle and charges, as long as Block Natasha here for ten seconds, and wait for the other knights to surround to get the final victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd's silver-white rifle with a sharp sharp metal smell and Natasha's "slaughter" black rifle, with the speed and weight of the dragon scale horse, do not defensively straight to stab Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Verdi set up a giant iron black shield to block Natasha's rifle. Around the shield, there was an inexplicable layer of transparent walls that protected Todd and Verdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood force of the Vaolirit family is the "Shield of Truth"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha did not evade against Todd’s rifle, just slamming forward sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Slaughter" pierced Verdi's shield with black and strange lines, and the time and space seemed to solidify, and the inside of the shield was small. The gaps are created, and even the walls of truth around are slowly splitting and disintegrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the Holm royal family is "cracked"! Also called "Sword of Truth"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha itself combines the blood of two top aristocrats, but after stimulating the power, it is obvious that it only shows the characteristics of "stubborn". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the battle of the "Shield of Truth" against the "Sword of Truth". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdi fully stimulates blood power, and the shield and the wall of truth begin to stabilize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd’s rifle stabbed Natasha’s abdomen without any blockage, and directly penetrated the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is even Todd himself is very surprised, according to his expectations, Natasha will use the "Thunder" sword to sniper rifle defense, and also She diddge aside, so that she did not have the momentum and accumulated strength of the charge, and the rifle that pierced Verdi was greatly weakened, but Natasha did not avoid it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pike penetrates the belly of Natasha, numerous solid silver-white metal spikes pass through the back of Natasha, a severely damaged blood dragon Did not play any role, Natasha suddenly riddled with holes, silver-gray blood splashed onto Lucien and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Natasha became silver gray, although with painful color, but there is no slight fluctuation of mood, the left hand did not pull the sword, directly stretched out, hold the support De's rifle, then with his body as a shield, against Todd and his horse back, continue to charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a noticeable abnormal excitement and blush on her face. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, a slamming sound, the "Slaughter" rifle out of the wall and the wall of truth that everyone expected to penetrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep cracks appeared, the shield became countless pieces, the wall of truth was completely collapsed, and Verdi could not believe this scene, only the heart One thought: "After she merged the two top bloodlines, in addition to the 'Sword of Truth', there seems to be another ability to mutate, and the more severe the injury, the stronger the ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdi is not a spoiled aristocrat who has not been on the battlefield, facing the rifle that is about to stab himself, very coolly inspiring magical items, a flash disappears in place, then appears in 20 meters Outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can she really kill us?" A ridiculous idea emerged in Verdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not stop, carrying a long gun, holding Todd’s rifle in the abdomen and left hand, pushing him to Verdi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien and others who followed her charge were struck by the clips on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right, Wynne is a four-level knight, and the ordinary knights and knights are swept down by his giant swords, and they are not able to threaten others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the right side of Lucian, Acacia, faced a knight of the same class, was entangled very tightly, and was repeatedly used by the Cavaliers to serve with longbows and rifles. Sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound coming from Brett and Tildo after a short scream, apparently already killed. Bocht’s heavy breathing has always been there, but his pain has been constant. I don’t know if I can hold on to the end, but I will see his little Avi. Daniel Shen is silent, and seems to be using the pain of injury to make atonement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
