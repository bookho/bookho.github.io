Annick, Lei Yiya, Sprint, and other apprentices who followed Lucien to learn arcanes mimicked the aristocrats they imagined, while quietly peeking at Mr. Evans, who played the piano next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper body of his black night dress is very stretched, shaking slightly with the lightness of the ten fingers, with a handsome face and a smile, as if there is a piano. Play the most beautiful oil paintings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the melody ends, Lucien gets up from the bench and smiles gently and cheerfully: "Ladies and gentlemen, Happy New Year."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and other apprentices sing: "Mr. Evans, Happy New Year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their voices have Qingyue, some are slightly lower and charming, some are full of magnetic surnames, and some are hoarse because of the arrival of the changing period, which makes Lucien very emotional, half-children are unconsciously one year old, body and The spirit has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the first day of 818, I hope that your new year will go further on the magic road." Lucien walked back to the table and picked it up. The "sky blue" drink was lifted to the apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina and other apprentices picked up their glasses and laughed and said: "We wish Mr. Evans a mid-level magician in the new year." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Year’s arrival, Lucien’s K, Lazar, Rock, Jerome, Cindy and other friends returned to their homes to gather with their loved ones, so He invited the apprentices from across the Stormwinds to their villas, lest they stay alone at Douglas Magic School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, Annick, Reyia, Heidi, Sprint, and Katrina benefited from Lucian’s coaching. They all entered the high-level apprenticeship class, and Cherie also completely followed the course and became a formal magic apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy dinner ended, the apprentices had a good night and returned to their rooms - just too excited, so they are a bit tired now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last Chelly walked up the stairs and suddenly turned to look at Lucien, smiling a little shyly: "Mr. Evans, there is actually a sentence for me." I always wanted to say that when you play the piano, it is like the genius musician in the description. When I think of him, I think of "Dedicated to Silvia", thinking of Jacques fighting for the future, which makes me feel Full of warmth and strength. Thank you, Mr. Evans, thank you for your piano."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s an enviable love." Lucien is joking Answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the maids coming in to clean up the table and the hall, Lucian also went up the stairs, returned to his study, then lit the arc lamp and sat in the chair On, unpack a letter on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was sent from Aalto six months ago, but just arrived today, most of the text inside is written in a well-defined idiom:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...My blood incineration has been completely ruled out, because the bloody instability caused by the explosive advancement has also been overcome, some miss the blue sky and white clouds outside, some miss my knight Long sword, miss the fierce battle, the bloody metal punch, and the music that makes people feel all over the heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...you should have arrived in Allinge. I don't know if the City of the Sky is as different from other cities as I remember..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Lucien, is Holm's food monotonous as I said? I always think it is the most unpalatable dish in the whole continent. I think that you will be accompanied by grilled fish and chips for a long time. Please allow me to mourn for you for five minutes, then laugh a few times with no good intentions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... When I was a child, I often snuggled up to my mother and listened to her anecdotes about magic and magic. It was a magnificent and mysterious world, wishing you a world of your own. I have forgotten the depression and pain of the past, and I am happy to learn arcane and magic. With your talent, I think it will become a middle-level magician within a few years. I am full of confidence in my good friend..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your friend John has inspired blood to become a knight, but his blood is 'eliminating', which makes me a little surprised. Fortunately, he is not a paladin of the church, will not join the team of night watchers, otherwise it is a destiny No, even if it is the arrangement of fate, I believe that you will not yield, will be like me to knock the wicked destiny to the ground and step on 10,000 feet. I have never complained about the fate of Silvia. Because from the beginning to the end, we all made one mistake ourselves, and we must bear our own mistakes. This is the simplest reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Let you feel my bad mood, but I will try to overcome it, I can be strong. Next, let me talk about happy things, your uncle Joel still likes to be a street performer on the street, according to Aunt Camille. He enjoys the joy that music brings to him. Your Eliza lost the work of the textile guild, because they dare not hire a knight's mother to wash clothes, she now mainly manages John and your manor." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Ai Wen is now learning the text while training with the Knights of Wien. Elena quits the work of the Musicians Association and concentrates on the study of the violin. I want to be a good musician. Mr. Victor and Little Felice ended their trip and returned to Aalto, who praised you for their anti-traditional and beautiful "Moonlight Sonata". Little Felice began to prepare his own music. Yes, I heard that she struggled for her dreams. I always have a calm and peaceful happiness. Maybe the meaning of life is always part of my friends..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein did not appear again after the Aalto Music Festival. I don't know what happened in the city of Aalto..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Road to Magic Need to concentrate, but don't forget that life is not just magic, but also music, food, fighting, friends, and love. Hey, through the usual relationship, I found that Lucien has a insistence on love. In the heart I want to think of one of the most sincere and beautiful feelings. Hey, it’s a pure, good boy, a true old-fashioned gentleman. I hope that you will meet the girl in your mind earlier, then bravely pursue her, advance and advance. Go forward, destroy all obstacles in front, 'beat' her, 'conquer' her, don't be shy! If you don't know how to pursue a girl, you can write to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Finally, happy, my good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha, June 30, 817."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien always read the letter with a smile, there is no gorgeous rhetoric, but the slow narrative makes Lu Xien feel a plain and warm feeling, like many years have not seen Old friends did not have any unfamiliar exchanges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy, I have written a letter to ask you back and forth for a year, the girl has been pursued for a long time..." After reading the letter, Lucien felt The mood was calm and peaceful, and the state of mind was very good, so he stood up and left the study room and went to his meditation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door and sit in a special chair. Lucien takes out a tube of green medicine from the storage bag, which is green and delicious, like a delicious drink. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "flying" potion, which is made from the blessed elves with natural fallen leaves and other materials, even if the main material of Lucien does not have flowers. Money, auxiliary materials also spent more than 70 arcane points. Coupled with these four months of meditation and the "Elemental" ring of pharmacy and experimental materials, Lucien now has only 61 or so arcane points left. It must be said that the magician is a burning money. Occupation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet mood, Lucien unhurriedly poured the "flying" potion into the mouth, the taste was sweet and clear, far better than other weird Pharmacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole soul of Lucien is light and unrelenting, and it is easy to enter the meditation environment, which is transparent and crystal clear, like a lake without any impurities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medicinal slows down, and the auxiliary mental power flows into the soul peacefully. It contains a complex spell model, which is the astrology system. "magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A twisted line, a complex surface together constitutes this illusory crystal, if the mathematical foundation is not good, or simply the ancient inheritance magician, then The next step is to sketch out the real spell model directly on the unreal lines of the crystal. This requires a lot of mental power and a low demand for arcane knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Wayne has no weakness in this respect, but instead blesses the spirit and soul through the power of the fateful star and the surrounding elemental particles, next to the Unreal Crystal. Delineate a curve that belongs to the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
