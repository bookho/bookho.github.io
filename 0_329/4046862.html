			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to the time and space of the half-faced "Devil's Jungle" of Natravos is still prominent in the vicinity of the valley, faintly visible inside the various odd-shaped trees . . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young man in a black magic robe came to the front with a fearful lead to Danishos, Dracula, Lucien and other legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After closing the top magic tower in Natravos, have there been any strange things? Or who has visited?" Wang Ogg asked the student of Natravos while walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man thought about it for a moment and shook his head slightly: "As usual, there are no guests, no surprises."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, he gnawed his teeth: "Actually, in fact, because the teacher is too harsh, he can stay away from the top magic tower. How far..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student, behind the teacher is swearing, in the ancient magic empire is a crime that can be executed, even in the current Magic Council, this is very not The behavior to be seen, but it is of great importance, involving the true cause of death of the teacher, the young man still truthfully described the situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black cloak conceals Og's face in the shadows, only two greenish lights appear, coming from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first turned green and did not emotionally turn around the young man, let him sweat out, tremble, and then hoarsely: "Nite The madman of Lavos, transformed into something bad, has to rely on the group of demons who have no reason and brain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason is that the legendary profession itself is the "abbreviation of the abyss" ", transforming the body into a demon king to grasp the most, this young man quietly defended himself." But he has no objection to the fact that Natravos is a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of moving slowly to the "gate of time and space", Ogg, "The Brain of the Elderly", "Six-armed Judge", Du Bernal And Danisos, Dracula, Myers, and Seth from time to time asked the young man to prove his results through astrology, prophetic superiority and reasoning, while Fitia stayed Valley of the Flamestone, guarding the headquarters of this dark council. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short trip is for these powerful players who can flash. It was a process of communication, so it was so slow, it could be slower, and it was soon in front of the "gate of time and space". Danisos flying in midair fanned two huge charcoal gray wings and lifted it up. The skull, gently snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time and space around it suddenly produced a "shock", the imaginary door slammed open, and then Danishos’s huge body seemed to swim in the sea. I voted in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. Lucien, who had never spoken, suddenly asked: "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" The young man pointed at himself doubtfully, then The expression is respectful: "Go back to you, you can call me David."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very common names can be seen everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legendary powers look at Lucian with a puzzled look. I don’t know why he suddenly asked this irrelevant question. Or just a polite gesture before asking? After all, "atomic control" is a musician. It’s the Queen’s husband, and it’s not surprising to value etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien just nodded and said: "David, take the lead." Then there is no more mouth, just as silent as before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unusual situation is only a small episode, but most of the strong players in the field are sophisticated guys, so the tyrannical will, a strange The sly spells all fell on David to make sure he had no problems. Otherwise, if he is deceived by a magician who is not high-ranking, it is a shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, they looked at each other and nodded slightly, saying that there was no problem, then they entered the time and space together with David. Go to the "Devil's Jungle". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and space changes, the scene in front of the scene is gradually blurred, and a weird forest appears in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-plane of Natravos is more chaotic than the abyss, and the creatures are like a patchwork. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these horrible creatures are only relatively speaking. In the eyes of all members of the "investigation group", their weakness is negligible. What is really worthy of attention is the pervasiveness. In the mud, in the air, in the water, the "chaos", it is the core of the half-plane, is the source of all these scenes, even if the legendary strong, if you do not pay attention, will be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave read the mantra, opening a wide passage in the jungle, and at the end is a pointed magic tower that towers into the sky, it is dark, Twisted and bent, similar to the trees in the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus swooped from the air to the magic tower, and the invisible wind blew all the chaos, and other legendary powers were not far behind. The ground entered the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom floor of the Magic Tower is covered with black carpet, no chandeliers, just a silver candlestick inlaid with dark red on the surrounding walls. The flame creates a faint vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the vicinity of each candlestick, there are different things, there are spurs of whip, and a mace with roots and steel thorns. There are tiny and different silver sewing needles. In short, everything that should not appear in the house of a legendary magician is placed there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the tool of Natravos self-abuse, but it was used a long time ago, and now there is no way to satisfy him..." and Knight Lavos is still familiar with Og, helplessly with a hoarse voice for the legend that has not come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is talking, because I really don't know how to evaluate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head with a funny smile, his eyes turned to the front of the hall, where a painting was hanging, with a special middle-aged man on the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man has a serious expression, with a pair of devil's horns engraved with patterns on his forehead, three white eyes, deep red pupils, nose bridge collapsed, his mouth protruding, his cheekbones towering Full of uncoordinated feelings, good-looking novels: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a self-portrait of Natravos..." Staniss noticed Lucien's gaze and introduced him casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... Lucien also guessed it was Natravos, and he secretly laughed, this is a legacy photo...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, from the ninth floor, it is the four-story magic tower that was destroyed." David led the legendary legends to go up. "We will go to the scene now." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many layers of this magic tower, but each layer is extremely wide and extremely high, even if the dragon of Danissos is only initially narrowing the body, space is also It looks very generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No hurry, check layer by layer, maybe find clues." Ogg interrupted David's words, so that you can find a lot of good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legendary powerhouses will naturally miss this opportunity, especially Stanis, which comes to Natravos books and notes, so the mission forwards It was very slow, and it was only a few hours later that it was close to the "discovery site." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Lucien and Staniss have all harvested a lot, rubbed and recorded a lot of useful information, although they are not Napier The core of Voss' current research, but also belongs to the outstanding achievements of the ancient magical empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is the ninth floor..." David stood on the stairs, in front of a gray stone gate covered with chaotic patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula covers his nose with his hands in white gloves: "Open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; With the stone door slowly opening, the unbearable scene inside was exposed to the public, and all the ceilings (floors) from the ninth to the thirteenth floors left only a few remnants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no room for the separated hall, anatomy room, synthesis room, alchemy room, restraint room, study room, etc. The location is completely shattered and there are signs of gasification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
