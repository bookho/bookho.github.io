			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t let a relationship fail to make this thing look like it! It’s not your dog’s love and heart that made the situation!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit! Your love concept is shit! If you really love Florensa, you won’t hurt her again and again! The shit is as dirty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien still heard the teacher’s full roar when he arrived at Fernando’s study on the 33rd floor of the Magic Tower. And Oliver swayed, half-side, not afraid to face the storm, completely miserable in the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what happened?" Lucien took a divination when riding the lift, but there was no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stopped the spray of saliva: "This bastard has been filled with desires and shit like the bastard, actually did not see your paper after reading Collapsed! So I took Douglas into his study!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s head stunned, shocked and worried: "My Excellency the Governor is fine." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Douglas, he neither broke his head nor recognized the world's broken and solidified." Oliver grinned, his face muscles twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Lucien slammed back to the original place: "That's okay, I solved the problem we have been worried about, I don't know if the Speaker can find promotion." "The road to the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stared at Oliver: "Why don't you finish? Douglas just saw the premise of the paper, and he deduced the latter. The content has not yet discovered the relativistic effect. If he sees it back when he goes back to the journal, he has experimented again. Oliver, you are the most glorious saint of the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Should not, the speaker is very stable when he leaves, and he has armed his mind with the philosophical concept of Lucien's absolute truth and relative truth. I believe that even if he sees the paper and does the experiment, it will be short-lived. Accepted after shaking." Oliver is more optimistic about this, or that his situation makes him only optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando converges on the anger of anger: "Oliver, you will die one day in your gorgeous feelings! Let's go to the 'real world', hope it will Exist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven orthodox magicians and the ten legends of the legendary magician are connected to the Allinge Magic Tower, so Fernando will soon pull Open the door to the inherent space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery of the real mystery is still beautiful, the lake is gently swaying under the breeze, the sparkling, Fernando’s violent momentum has eased a lot, and Oliver glances at it. Road: "Your luck is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the secret puppet, the three passed through the long corridor to the Douglas study and saw He stared quietly at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas, I heard that you saw Lucien’s paper? Don’t know what?” Fernando’s grasp of Lucien was an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is still in a black tuxedo, but the bow tie is loose, it seems to want to breathe, he turns his head, the deep vicissitudes of the eyes look at the three, the corner of the mouth There is a bit of bitterness: "In fact, I want to say, you are late, I have already done the experiment of electromagnetic cyclotron?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your cognitive world is broken Solidified?” Fernando was fairly acceptable to this result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Douglas is still standing here, this is the worst consequence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head and revealed a little bit of confusion on his face: "It’s a little psychological preparation, and I have encountered some problems in the past. At the crucial moment, I also remembered the concept of Lucien's absolute truth and relative truth, as well as his description of the "approximation of the low-speed state" of my movement system. Finally, I built a framework of the cognitive world from a higher level, and the original understanding. Incorporating it, although it is still shocked and injured, it is not broken and solidified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened secretly, not only to build magic from nothing The superb figures of the parliament, the companions, the younger generations and the students with him at the beginning, after experiencing the development of the arcane, the theory of subversion, and the church attack, only a few magicians such as Fernando survived, no matter what, he said Uploading a strange character, changing it to the present, may not be able to withstand this tolerance and accommodation, maybe the world has broken and solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and shook his head. "Not for the time being, this is fortunate, because the biggest impact of Lucian's thesis on me is not the subversion of the movement system, but the change of time and space concept."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past research and battle, I have had a similar idea of ​​sports, but it is difficult to overthrow my own things because of the constraints of old ideas, but beyond the imagination of time and space It is subverting my cognition and making me quite confused. The world that is still clear before my eyes seems to be blurred. Fortunately, I can see that Lu Xien’s exploration in time and space is still preliminary. There are still many problems. At least the problem of the family name has not been solved, so I am barely able to bear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "relative The time and space view is not so well accepted and understood. I hope that you will be able to explore the mysteries of time and space with me in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait until I finish this Thesis." Douglas laughed awkwardly The eyes that were originally crystal clear were awkward. "What is time and what is the space? These problems make me confused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you digest the road west This paper of En may indeed be promoted to the gods." Fernando deliberately opened the subject and prevented him from falling into the world of 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and gestured to the three to sit down: "Almost impossible. The change in the sports system can really improve my strength, but that comes from The difficulty of magic display, in order to promote the gods, it is difficult to describe the movement system, unless it can change the time and space, or have a deeper grasp of gravity, just as Brooke wants to reshape the cognitive world. Promotion must truly understand electromagnetic waves, and more deeply grasp the electromagnetic force. It is not close to the source, and cannot be advanced.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is at the peak of the legend It is long enough, and his wisdom is deep enough. Even if there is no way to find the right road to advance, he can also find something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he did not continue this topic, but looked at Lucien and smiled: "I naturally exported Oliver's transformation equations, but why not The equation of mass in your thesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands that this is because he or she is coming early, or else the wisdom and arcane level of the Speaker It will take a long time to be able to be derived, so I will call the secret puppet to bring the paper and pencil and deduct it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energy, quality... No wonder your atomic fusion has such great power." Douglas's eyes are so deep and concealed that his eyes look like they shine. This formula, "Even if there are still many key models that cannot be explained, I think that I have built a lot of 'eternal blaze' time much shorter than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He originally relied on mental strength to build. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he started why: "Why can energy and quality be transformed, and what is the nature of matter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "Douglas, since you have initially accepted Lucian's paper, let's discuss the matter of Thrad first, first do it if he uses something else. The way to bypass the promise of preparation, hey, is the plan that Lucien said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas retracted his thoughts and nodded and smiled: "I like the plan." No one can be smart and powerful enough to calculate everything, relying on the collection of information in advance and the simulation of various situations, and this is the strength of our magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The four people discussed for a long time, when they left Lucien, Fernando and Oliver, Douglas smiled: "I am looking forward to the day when you can study gravity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I hope to get your guidance from the Speaker," Lu Xien humbly returned . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of their departure, Douglas suddenly sighed: "Gravity, I am still very confused, where does it come from, how come..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late April, 1984, the song of the silver moon alliance Allinge Within the division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two high-level magicians of the two electromagnetic factions happened to meet each other, so they discussed the latest advances in arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
