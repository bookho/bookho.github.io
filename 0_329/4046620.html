			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Robe of the Great Arcanist", the "Imperial Throne" robe was naturally abandoned by Lucien, this piece was obtained from the "Pale Hand" The reward has always been that the surname is stronger than the practical surname, especially after the life burial ceremony is held, and Lucien’s seven-ring magic “recession ray” can be built entirely in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shame, there are vests and shirts in it, Lucien is safe, after the branding of the "Robe of the Great Arcanist", when The face of Helen changed the magic robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legendary item has just been worn on the body, and Lucien feels like a huge whirlpool, madly absorbing his own mental power, shaking the meditation environment If it is not that he has already recognized the world's semi-solidified, I am afraid that it will really burst his head because of the shock of mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it takes, when Lucien’s mental energy is about to dry up, this absorption is slowly calmed down, and the dark black robes are lit up. A layer of faint black light, and then according to Lucian's mind into a black double-breasted long dress, the double recovery of mental power began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen has not spoken, seems to have fallen into his own thinking, as Fernando said, her own name is not indifferent, on the contrary lively and talkative, can Things outside of surgery and magic research are hard to arouse her interest, and it is like a goddess of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Changed?" She suddenly woke up, "Evans, to understand your general theory of relativity, you need to master what mathematical knowledge, you can Open a book list for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, but I don't know what Helen has mastered." Lucien feels the spirit Recovery, the mind is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen shook his head and smiled and said: "You are also a great arcane master. You don't have to call me, you will follow me in this book. Write, so that I can know what your mathematical foundations are, and make up for what I have missed in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Helen." Lucien Didn't insist on your name, or what about the legendary magicians who didn't have the title of Archer? Anyway, the teacher will always be the teacher. The chairman of the chairperson will always be the speaker of the chairperson. Hathaway's mother-in-law is always Hathaway's mother-in-law. This is a private relationship, no need to consider others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen’s small room for storing legendary items is closed, and Lucien walks out the door: “You have rested in Fernando’s study in the past few days, waiting for the speaker The half-face came out and combined with the 'prophet' they reviewed your paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is more demanding than the storm, even her own magic tower and The Atomic Research Institute will not let Lucien go back, lest it be robbed of people - the reason why things are so big tonight is that there are many reasons why her emotional shocks have not been dealt with in time, so she is safe for Lucien. Be more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no opinion: "Then I will give the butler and Lazar first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Helen slightly decapitated, speeding up the pace, walking in front, said that he would not eavesdrop on Lucien's communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo doesn’t know much about magic. Things tonight scared him, and he contacted Lucien while letting Pinocchio’s magic tower The defense was completely turned on, and I was anxiously waiting for the reply of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucine had nothing to do and Allen was in the usual situation, Leo was relieved, and Lucien was connected to Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Hey, this is called Evans!" Lazar said excitedly. "Your gravitational nature is too cool, you How can it relate to time and space?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously didn't understand the previous part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien half jokingly said: "When I was dreaming, I met a man who was probably called Albert, and told me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, you are really humorous." Lazar laughed. "I have always heard you say that you want to integrate gravity into the special theory of relativity. I don't have any research in this area. It's stupid, otherwise a little With a little tool to assist the surname, my arcane level will increase by one level!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien bounced the surface of the dress: "I am also very surprised. I have been letting you concentrate on the special theory of relativity. As a result, except for students like Annick who are supervised by me, you have nothing to do."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar laughed and said: "Time, space, energy, quality, reference system, which is so easy to understand, I have been studying hard, but little progress, however, Compared with the difficult and incomprehensible general relativity, it makes people feel dizzy. The special theory of relativity is like a lovely child. I will continue to delve into it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" just now, your The students are so excited that they are crazy, but they have been unable to contact you and almost blasted my monocles. They are completely worshipped and admired for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien pinched his mouth: "On the arcane, this is not a good thing, I love my teacher, but I love the truth more. Lazar, I have to assist the teacher in reviewing the paper these days. If you don't come to the institute, you are responsible for the normal operation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lazar quickly agreed, and finally earnestly and solemnly said: "Please allow me to temporarily forget the relationship between us and let me pay tribute to your great achievements beyond the genius and the times. You have developed a field of arcane development. The way down, dispelling the dark clouds that hang over the arcane sky, whether it is general relativity or new alchemy, is the most magnificent and dazzling achievement in the history of magic, especially the former."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking to Lazar, Lucien called Natasha again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your lord is the master of time and space, and the eternal of the stars opens the door to the truth of the microcosm." Natasha heard it as Lucien. The voice, suddenly rejoicing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she does not understand the general theory of relativity, it does not prevent it from knowing from the description of Lucien that this is an explanation of the nature of gravity, involving time and space, and neutrons. The discovery, she has long been clear from the mouth of Hathaway's mother-in-law, Lucien, Morris, its great significance, so he coined a tribute to make a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Are you listening to the real channel of the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Al When I was asked, I was listening to the voice of mystery and the truth of the world." Although the magic radio has not been promoted to the opposite side of the Stormwind Strait, she is certainly not lacking, and the two channels, the former is full of fun, is her usual pastime, The latter is the channel through which she subconsciously pays attention to Lucien. "In fact, I have always thought that arcane research is very interesting. I can learn from the beginning when I am free, but I don't have any spiritual talent."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha has the foundation in this respect, and does feel that the things revealed by arcane research and experiments are very fun, so I plan to try it, but she has no hope of any achievements. Also not ready to focus on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien whispered: "As long as you can ** arbitrage magic and alchemy devices, I will slowly teach you to see if you will become Experimental disaster manufacturing machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked and talked indiscriminately, until Helen came back to the end of the corridor, Lucien was violently Awakened: "Because of the great impact of this incident, and waiting for the review of the paper to receive the award, I may not be able to go to Rentat in a short time, and apologize to me for the Grand Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, Hathaway's mother-in-law probably told me about it, and I also heard your speech, you will stay at Aringe with peace of mind, don't rush out, I also lick this I will straighten out the relationship between the House, the Cabinet, and the nobility. Then, I will come to Aringe to find you! Visit your institute and the Magic Tower!” Natasha understood the authenticity, and the heart smirked and added a sentence. You still don't know that I am already a 9th-level gold knight. I want to give you a "surprise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "My students have always wanted to see Her Majesty, well, I hang up first."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Natasha answered with a nasal voice, and then whispered slightly, "My Lord Arcane Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After interrupting the electromagnetic communication, Lucien remembered a problem. Before Natasha and Annick, they should have contacted themselves many times, but they ignored the burning for various reasons. Later, they did not know who tried. I have found myself, so I may miss a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Requires communication management, need 'missed calls'..." Lucien considers this functional module. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
