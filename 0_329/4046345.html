			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s study. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien used the good-looking decorative surname font to write the Planck thermal radiation formula, the storm master completed the verification of the data in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether the long wave or the short wave range is consistent with the experimental data, at least for now, it is a correct formula." Fernando nodded cautiously, "but we It’s a good idea to complete a few more experiments to confirm its correct last name.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being troubled by two formulas that only apply to half of the field, it’s been entangled for two or three weeks. The storm dominated Fernando and felt that his bad emotions were about to blow up completely, so when he saw the temporary perfect formula of Lucien, he didn't care about anything, just wanted to verify it correctly, and then lost the two damn formulas. Go to the side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since learning from Fernando, Lucien started his experiment for the first time without a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Arcane Master's experiment speed is much faster than the average magician, but when the data is used to thoroughly verify the correctness of the heat radiation formula, the time is close to noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The formula that "deducted" like this..." Fernando was satisfied with the relaxation, and the wretched and unfair attitude revealed: "Lu Xien, there is I really can't think too much, well, don't worry too much when you are in love, hesitate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are these two topics linked? of? Lucien is a bit unable to adapt to Fernando's jumping surname, it is more quantum than quantum, and his teacher seems to be single, although the theory in love sounds very reasonable, but it may not be effective in practical use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, since the formula has been pieced together, do you want to write a letter to tell Douglas them." Lucien ignored Fernando’s jumping surname and deliberately put his Attention to the formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando nodded happily: "Of course, I think they must have been bothered by these two formulas for a long time. I don't think it was my students who came out first. But... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he changed from a wretched old man to a severe and violent storm: "Since this formula is correct, it means that it is hidden behind." The law of hierarchy reveals the essence of heat radiation, otherwise it is impossible to correct! We can not stay in the formula itself, but also to explore the meaning it represents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the tone is a bit irritating, Lucien feels the emotion he wants to try, which is the impulse to explore the unknown and the nature of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to write to Lord Douglas?" Lucien’s plan was to let the arcane masters familiarize and agree with the formula so that they could be gradual. accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando walked back to the desk and didn’t lift his head: "Write them and let them participate in this discussion. I have a hunch that it will be a hard time." Yes, you wrote a paper before and after the formula was put together, submitted to the audit committee with me and Douglas, and then handed it to the "Arcane" to let the arcane masters see the experiment and formula derivation. The complete situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can resolve the true meaning of this formula before the next issue of "Arcane", it will be published together. The surgeons understand the nature of thermal radiation and effectively improve the magic in this area. If not, I hope that they will be inspired by the discussion after "Arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to be successful, Lucien, quickly wrote the formula into the letter, handed it to the six great arcane masters, and then discussed the problems behind the formula with Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the discussion, Lucien was quite tormented, because it was not time to introduce the correct explanation, which needs to be thrown when other roads are unable to pass. The surgeons accepted, so Lucien had to discuss with Fernando in the other fields of the Department of Thermal and Electromagnetics and tried to cover up, not letting some of his words reveal secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s quite difficult and painful to pretend in front of the Arcane Surgeon. Fortunately, most of the attention of the storm is on the discussion formula. Crossing Sean already knows the true meaning, which makes Lucien a little more relaxed, taking "nutrition" from the discussion with the Arcanist to fill the foundation of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, teacher." Lucien was a little shocked. He was advanced last night. Today is seen by the storm master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando humor smiled: "When you are doing experiments, the level of mental power that has been shown has reached the five rings, and you are in the theory of arcane and magic. The ability to get along with this time, I can also judge, so unless you are lazy, in the next two weeks, you can definitely promote the five rings. Since you have advanced, this time performance is better than the soup at that time They are a lot better than Chloe. I will bring the application of the Institute of Atomic Research tomorrow. I will write an assessment and sign it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you teacher." Lucien thought that it would take another week or two to wait for the discussion on the formula of heat radiation to get Fernando's support. I didn't think that I could get the evaluation opinion so quickly. I was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The Perfection of Fernando Formula and Douglas Formula in Thermal Radiation."" Fernando, after writing the assessment and signing it, picked up Lucien and prepared to submit it together. The paper, slowly read the topic, a rare smile in the discussion of arcane, "This formula will be called Evans blackbody radiation formula, and the constant inside will definitely be named Evans constant, no matter what you later There are no major achievements, your name will be circulated along with this constant and formula, and will be mourned by countless magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Periodic Table of the Elements in the Magic Council The point of view is to summarize the results of surnames, not formulas, constants, theorems, unit systems, so there is no surname in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The meaning of this constant is far from what you think now, teacher." Lucine sighed softly and folded the application and the paper. Then, I opened Douglas's reply and read it according to the habits of the past half-month:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am very happy to see you and your student Lucien I solved this problem that has been plaguing me for many days. It made me completely indifferent to the experiments I talked about before... Please congratulate Lucien Evans on my behalf. Maybe only his energetic young people can do it. The decision to make up the mathematics method without considering any actual arcane meaning. He is like an uncontaminated diamond, which blooms purely..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"...the formula has come out, and we should calm down and think about why it will be correct, not the two formulas that were derived before? I can assert that there must be a law behind us that we have not yet discovered. Making the formula conform to the nature of thermal radiation, What is it? Any seemingly coincidental, ordinary thing behind it must have the dominance of hidden laws. We can't stay on the surface, indulge in the achievements we have achieved, but should explore it in depth, ask a few more questions... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I believe that we will eventually understand the true meaning of this formula and use it to grasp the essence and laws of thermal radiation and to move closer to the world. Real..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, '100,000 why'." Fernando said once again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the letters of the great Arcanists such as Brick, Hathaway, Oliver, Helen, and Vicente are similar to Douglas, and are discussing the things behind the formula. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The morning after three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Comprehensive evaluation of the two members, the evaluation of Mr. Lucien Evans’ formula is: completely solved the two formulas in blackbody radiation They are only applicable to the shortcomings of the long-wave and short-wave ranges, and are perfectly matched with the experimental data. It is a formula that can be promoted and applied. According to the naming rules of the Magic Council, it is now named the Evans blackbody radiation formula. The constant in the formula is Evans constant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this formula is purely mathematically completed, has not yet found the support of the arcane theory in the field of heat, nor the analysis of the meaning of the formula, Further research is needed, so the reward points are twenty-five and the arcane points are two hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Carlylena to help send it home The audit document, Lucien is very happy, the parliament's reward for the formula is better than most papers without second-level evaluation, but this is not the focus, the focus is on the formula and constant reference points! They don't need to share with other people like basic data such as atomic weight, they belong to themselves completely, and the validity period is three years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "Atomic Research Institute" application, because of the many things involved in this aspect, the review process is lengthy and it takes one to two weeks to get results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The release of the "Arcane" journal has caused a great sensation among all the magicians. Almost every magician I met was discussing the 'Arcane meaning' of the illusion, it seems that Isabella's The research results have completely defeated the past illusion theory, it is really funny! Her little guy 'hormone' is only applicable to a small part of the illusion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... This kind of atmosphere has put a lot of pressure on the wizard's house. In order to ensure the glory and credibility of the laurels, after all the high-level wizards discussed, it was decided to put Isabella on the crown four days later, that is, Monday... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s a pity that I’ve suggested that you’ve shared the Guiguan’s opinion and they’ve been rejected. They don’t quite agree with your brainwave theory. I think it is still very imperfect... I think Evans will definitely strengthen this research and gradually improve the theory. I hope that one day I will see you win the crown and become the second one in the past 100 years to receive the highest honor in different fields. Step magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This ceremony of awarding the title will be held at the headquarters of the Wizards House. If Evans is free, you can come to the ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have decided to put a crown on Ms. Isabella." Lucien let go of the letter and said leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" The next Sprint was a bit embarrassed and didn't understand the meaning of this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien did not repeat, smiled and went to the parliament headquarters, it is almost time to give advice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After several days of intense discussion, it is still impossible to analyze the meaning behind the formula, which makes Fernando quickly invade the storm, and often violently thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I have a suggestion." Lucian looked at Fernando seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s surprise overwhelmed his urgency and temper, and asked in confusion: “What advice?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the problem of the family name, no matter whether it is the soup, Axikana, or Chloe, Aphrodite, he dare not face him, let alone comments like Lucien. So Fernando will be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think that the newly established thermodynamic molecular motion system should be introduced into the formula analysis. From a statistical point of view, the description of entropy and probability seems to It helps to solve the problems we face, it brings me some inspiration." Lucien always feels that he is slowly opening the "Pandora Box." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knowledge has existed more than a decade ago, and it is the result of Chloe’s award of the Ice and Snow Medal, but he has recently combed it from beginning to end. , making them a preliminary system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando expressed his approval without thinking for a long time: "Since nothing else can be explained, then we will start from the perspective of entropy and probability."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction is right, the two quickly enter the work phase of the real surname, plus the big arcanes such as Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, etc. Overcoming, the meaning of the whole formula is about to surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Cauques, the capital of Calais, a black magic tower that looks like an astrological tower stands in the misty corner of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A differently decorated carriage slowly drove in front of the Magic Tower and a guest was introduced to the banquet hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, Ms. Isabella, Mr. Drummond." The President of the Wizard House, the Seventh Arcane Master, the Nine Ring Master Adarbert? Feng? Miller smiled and greeted Isabella from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless eyes around, most of them are excellent magicians, and there is also a big man at the committee level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, dressed up Isabella is shrouded in starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Aringe" Magic Tower, the thirty-third floor, a study that looks ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of Fernando and Lucien is nearing completion, and the rules and meanings of the entire formula are about to be presented, and several Arcanists are in their respective positions. Waiting for Fernando's letters in the Magic Tower, they all have their own arcane and magical research to do, and the progress on this is far less than the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The banquet hall at the headquarters of the Sorcerer's House, guests gathered, lively and extraordinary, the magicians gathered together in twos and threes, discussing Isabella, discussing illusion and arcane, discussing the development of arcane and magic . The ancient sorcerer dress, the modern banquet form, the two sides are intertwined, showing the exuberant taste of both the long and the lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire hall is light orange, soft and warm, and everyone is "plated" with a layer of golden color, radiant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an atmosphere, Feng? Miller boarded the half-high platform in front of him, and the discussion gradually subsided. He politely asked Isabella and Rachel to come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter behind him holds a silver plate of witches with two laurels woven like crystals. They are so crystal clear and finely carved. In the radiance, you can see the magic runes and structures flowing in the crystal, like art works over magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella’s paper was co-signed with Rachel and thanked her for her help and inspiration in the long-term experiment. So after verification by the wizard's house, they decided to share the crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that in the eyes of all the magicians, even Rachel himself, it is natural that Isabella is the protagonist of today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In view of the discovery and collection of hormones by Ms. Isabella and her student Miss Rachel, and verifying their application in illusion The House of the Wizards and the Court of Calais decided to award them the laurels of the sorcerer in recognition of their outstanding contributions in the field of illusion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two top laurels were von? Miller was wearing the hair of two women deliberately rolled up, dazzling and eye-catching, just like their glory in the field of illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause sounded without suspense, and the arcane artists who came to watch the ceremony were more or less excited, and the wizards had to follow the complexities. There is dissatisfaction, frustration, and a little admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After several days of hard work, the analysis of the blackbody radiation formula was completely "presented" in front of Fernando and Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "view" that was completely unpredictable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando suppressed anger and awkwardly asked: "Lushine, to make the formula true, it must be assumed that the absorption and emission of energy is not continuous, and Is it a copy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to this, there seems to be no strange words, Fernando seems to be facing the god of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, teacher." Lucien also felt his repression, but the answer was heavy and firm, gentle and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Isabella is wearing a beautiful laurel and is making a short speech to the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the ancient magical empire, due to the lack of powerful mathematical tools for dealing with the irregular patterns of the same kind of reality, the construction of the spell model and the analysis of magic encountered Great obstacles can only rely on the high growth of mental power, savage and difficult to complete the easy and easy construction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this with Douglas The speaker's creation of calculus and the end, plus the perfection of several Arcanists, we have powerful mathematical tools that can help us calculate and construct irregular spell models more easily..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be said that calculus is the foundation of our arcane system. Segmentation and infinitesimal analysis based on continuous and smooth basis allow us to infinitely approach the real world. From this perspective, this The mathematical tool itself contains the main idea of ​​the theory of arcaneism, that is, it is consistent with the real world. Its continuous surname is inherited from the continuous surnames of the coastline, the land boundary, the wind, the waves, the flowing water, and the time. ... "On this basis, Douglas's theory of force field and Lord Brooke's theory of electromagnetics and light darkness together constitute the main framework of the entire arcane world." But unfortunately, magic such as illusion, deformation, and summoning can't find the direction of integration into the arcane system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called continuity means the development of things It is uninterrupted, just like the flowing rivers seen by the naked eye, just like the journey we passed, they will not suddenly lack a lot of pieces in the middle, and become a leaping forward, like a thermometer, one degree Celsius will rise to two. Celsius, between the one must be one point, one point two ... and not directly jump from one to two, the middle is completely blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
