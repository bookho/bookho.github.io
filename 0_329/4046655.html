			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 10, the sky is blue, the breeze is refreshing, the sun is shining, and it is sprinkled on everyone, brewing a touch of laziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square outside the Nexus Palace is surrounded by the "Sword of Truth" in silver-gray full-length armor, blocking the crowd of people outside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on! Come on!" I don't know who shouted, the crowd suddenly quieted down, and all eyes were condensed in the "War of the Knights" guard. On the central avenue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black carriage with a mysterious fire coat of arms slowly drove through the street under the specially selected silver-gray dragon scales and walked into Nike Outside the Palace Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the carriage, a tall man, a tall lady, wearing the most popular black double breasted in the Holm Kingdom Long dresses and burgundy cake skirts, if not the black-colored silver star arcade badges on the chest, the black ring magic badge on the silver, it is hard to believe that they are mysterious and strange magicians, they only think they are high society And lead the fashion trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s beautiful, the witches are completely devoid of the paleness and weight of the previous churches, and they are no different from ordinary ladies, just like the voice of mystery. That way." A young man is dazzled. Although Rantat has many magicians and apprentices, they never take the initiative to express their identity, so most people do not know the true look of the magician. Remaining a stereotyped impression by the perfusion of the church, and then gradually twisted back under the influence of the voice of mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl next to her eyes also said: "Yes, I always thought that the magician was a look, pale, dry skin, a pair of hands like chicken paws I like to dissect the body at night, and it smells like a stink, but now it seems that it is the difference between an angel and a demon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical parliament intelligence personnel mixed in the crowd secretly sneak Laughing, what you want is your reaction. The highest panel of judges regards the wedding of Lord Evans as an important occasion to show the new image of the magician. This selects the magician who can represent the image of the new era magician as the Lord Evans. The followers, and let most of the necromancers of the pale hands stay in Heidler City, it is best not to go out today, so that all ordinary people understand that the magician represents the most powerful strength and the most profound knowledge, representing The direction of the civilized society represents the development requirements of the overwhelming majority of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I heard that the former witch was very good at tempting people. Although she was pale and thin, she was very glamorous." The other men were somewhat sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same, there are girls who are sorry: "In fact, a pale but handsome gentleman, carefully and carefully cutting the body, you don't feel cool Is it delicious? For example, Mr. Felipe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the intelligence personnel can only shake their heads, as sure, as Evans said, the number one More, the taste will be very complicated, and even after everyone has adapted to the new image of the magician, they have to go back to the mysterious route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magicians all stood on the red carpet, the crowds saw that they had not seen today’s protagonist Lucien? Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when they were puzzled, there was a huge roar in the air, and the horror of the atmosphere made every knight, magician and ordinary person feel a little Trembling, like facing the top creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the blue sky became dark, the huge wings slightly covered the top, and then a translucent figure descended from the sky and fell to the center of the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dragon!" Someone screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the capital of the kingdom, protected by powerful forces, their understanding of the dragon is limited to legends and "people and nature" programs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon's head is proudly carried, the crystal-like scales reflect the sunlight, intertwined into a clear and pure layer of light, which suddenly makes people feel terrible except The dragon is also very nice! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief panic, someone pointed to the dragon and said: "Where is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, is Evans riding on a dragon? It’s so cool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little crystal Aphre's eyes glanced at her. This kind of self-esteem is better to do more. Just think of the "borrowing" snow and ice medal "quantum" and the bag of gold shining with beautiful colors, it I couldn't help but drool and figure out whether to develop the "Dragon Knight" tourism project in my spare time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the back of the crystal dragon, a young man in a black tuxedo flew down and stood in front of the red carpet. He wore a black bow tie and backed up. It is straight, moderate in shape, handsome in appearance, gentle in temperament, dark and dark in black eyes, as if it is a lake that attracts souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a big musician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure like the legend!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl and a man sigh with satisfaction, better than they thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stepped calmly, not too fast, and walked into the Nexus Palace on the red carpet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the source hiding in the crowd next nodded to the darkness of Ketonia: "Haywe, Winston, and several others Legend is here, we are patiently waiting for the opportunity to protect only Hathaway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he quietly withdrew from the crowd and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia’s face is faint, he already knows the preparation of the flame of the source, and clearly understands the greatness, but why he will mix with them Together? Is it his own channel or the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath and pressing all kinds of suspicions, he continued to focus on the movements of Nexus Palace, and he has come to this step, only to be determined Go on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Palace of Nexus, the Queen’s Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw Natasha in a white wedding dress. Although she has a white court dress and a knight dress, it is a simple type, it is rare to put on Such a gorgeous wedding dress, sly lace, fluffy skirt, white gloves and stockings set her like a purple-haired angel, slightly stiffer appearance and a lot of light, people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beautiful?" Natasha smirked, and as soon as she spoke, the feeling of holy beauty disappeared, and the heroic knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the dressing up of the Grand Duke of Vaoli, Hathaway, and Camille, looking at themselves, no way like Natasha was so careless, free and easy to be alone, slightly blushing and laughing: "Beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha licked his lips triumphantly. Picking up an eyebrow, and then looking at the grandfather Waorit with a touch of sensation: "Father, finally let you see that I am married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waou Ride Grand Duke was comforted and took Natasha’s hand and took a shot: “I finally saw this day before I died. I finally saw you wearing a wedding dress, as beautiful as your mother. After today, you will have yourself. The family has lived, it is the wife of others, the mother of others, very good, very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am your daughter, I will never change. Natasha blinked and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuolirit turned to look at Lucien: "You are a warrior, relieved my troubled warrior, I hope you can take care of her forever. Caring for her, whether poor or rich, regardless of illness or health, whether young or aging, support her and stay away from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Natasha is Queen, so there is a ceremony close to the wedding in the palace of Nexus, but the role played by the priest and the bishop is usually taken by the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, so that it is easy for the magicians to accept, otherwise the highest comment It is too funny for the members of the regiment to actually hold the wedding of the priests of the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will, in the name of arcane and magic." Lucien is serious and sincere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ; Grandfather Waorit also said to Natasha: "You will be his wife, I hope that you will always care for him, understand him, accompany him, no matter... support him, and never give up. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandpa Waorit laughed and put Natasha's left hand in the palm of Lucien: "I brought her to your side in the name of my father and wish you a new family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took Natasha’s hand and shouted with her father, Hathaway’s mother-in-law, Camille’s aunt, and then took her to Nexel Palace. Go outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the red carpet, through the palace, through the atrium, through the garden, the two appeared outside the gates of Nexel Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s black is steady, handsome and gentle, the woman’s white gauze is sacred and bright, and the two great knights and the onlookers are suddenly quieted and admired. Such a beautiful scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha work together to lift the hands of the two men to the top of the head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately cheering around:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Queen!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is like a tide, roaring, and the whole area near the Nexel Palace is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, due to protection and wedding image issues, Lucien Instead of taking the "Little Crystal Dragonship", Natasha took the carriage and slowly drove to the magic steam train under the protection of Hathaway. Winston and others accompanied the Grand Duke of Vaoli. And other nobles to protect them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! Dangdang, the Klaus magic steam train started, the most rigorous box, only Lucien, Natasha, Hathaway, Grand Duke of Vaolirit, Camille, Winston and other nobles In another compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems to have a strong defense defensive array, and the ability to isolate space transmission." Natasha is very excited, both for the wedding and for the sake of The coming battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Hathaway, who wore a light blue court dress, couldn’t talk without speaking, and the silver-gray eyes looked at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "It is only equivalent to the protection level of the Nine Rings. The ability to isolate space is not strong. It is far less than the Allinge Magic Tower. And the city of the sky locks itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way." Natasha Dongxi West, look at it curiously if she doesn't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart City is not far from Allinge, the magic steam train is quickly halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked at Lucien with a little doubt, and was approaching Allinge. They still didn’t do it. Did they really give up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Aringe, even if the Pope is close, don't even think about killing Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants to answer, inside the compartment protected by many magical arrays, suddenly cracked a gap, solidified black and white gray spread out, impacting the sea Servi, Grand Duke of Vaoli, Camille and Lucien, Natasha! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crack in the dead spirit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white gray of death is like a tidal wave, rushing and rushing, bringing out the rapid expansion of cracks, and simply not giving Lucian and Natasha a chance to react. Swallow them in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri did not hesitate to transfer a single magic to Vaoliet and Camille to another car, and because of this, there was no such attack. Any danger and damage are also swallowed by the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short moment, there was no one in the carriage, and the cracks with monotonous colors quickly contracted and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead spirit world, there is only a black and white gray railroad track, there is a huge and complicated magic array, and the top of the magic array stands three horrible Strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is a tall mummy covered in dark yellow cloth with a golden crown on his head, a skull in a magical robe, and a week around his head. The satellite-like stones are of different colors and crystal clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
