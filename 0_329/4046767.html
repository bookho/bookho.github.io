			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at Heidi’s eyes, Lucien smiled: “It’s really a very simple and impractical artificial intelligence...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Hearing the teacher's words, Heidi's expression immediately smashed down, and Chery, Ophelia, Lovi, Black and other magicians involved in the creation also showed a depressed look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint is very happy to attack Heidi, who is usually awkward at this time: "Look, the teacher thinks this is basically a toy, and it is still bulky. A huge toy that can't be used by ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, other aspects of this artificial intelligence are very poor, the only thing worth commending is that it does not require a magician. **, relying on electric energy to start and run, so it only needs an ordinary person who can understand the manual. The problem is that it is too big, too heavy, too precise, too expensive, not suitable at all. Promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Assisted Computing Array is only a mid-level magician, changing the advanced arithmetic array in the lab or the teacher's legendary level auxiliary array. Explode your artificial intelligence with shame, oh, the teacher's mental arithmetic ability can beat it perfectly..." Sprint said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not hostile to Heidi, but he thinks that Annick and Heidi are few real friends, but he thinks that the more time Heidi, Heidi has more power to improve artificial intelligence, and to change himself, he will be excited to be full of battles, and will not accept defeat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been this kind of surname, but the feeling of being unruly has been a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi gave him a glimpse and vowed that he must create a perfect artificial intelligence that would completely spur the auxiliary computing matrix. Beat, let his mouth open and close, let his chin fall to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin, Nordaniel wants to comfort Heidi, but can't find the right words because he doesn't understand the field of artificial intelligence, Katrina And Irene was inspirational with a thumbs up, indicating that Heidi was able to do this for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Natasha’s face, there is a playful smile. According to her understanding of Lucien, straightforward criticism is often a precursor to praise. The words of praise at the beginning are often connected with rebuttals and euphemistic accusations, which are described in his own words. This is called "subtleness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Although this artificial intelligence has many shortcomings, its spirit and direction are enough to match the Arcane Award." Lucian continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi subconsciously licked his own ears, suspected that he had produced auditory hallucinations, and that simple and impractical artificial intelligence contained the equivalent of the Evans Arcane Award. value? Isn't this a joke? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "There is no doubt that it is simple and impractical, but in the oldest era of magic, our ancestors got from magical creatures. The original spells constructed by the patterns are as simple and impractical. In our eyes, they may be so ridiculous and sad. They must use the spirit of the four or five rings to display a spell that has been simplified to the apprenticeship. But can we deny their contribution?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Lazar had a tacit agreement with the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint and Annick also nodded lightly. Without the original singer’s seemingly ridiculous and impractical effort, there would be no today’s Magic civilization! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, the achievements of arcane and magic are developed step by step, Heidi, Cherie, Lowe, Black, Ophelia from The artificial design concept of the artificial intelligence began, and it was not easy to go to the first finished product today. Although it is still very simple, bulky and cumbersome, the ideas and directions contained are extremely important. Sean’s expression said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi finally confirmed that the teacher was praised, and immediately smugly raised his chin, and then slightly embarrassed red cheeks: "Teacher, design concept is good Your guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...about four or five times. If the research on crystals has a breakthrough in surname development, perhaps the volume and weight will not increase when the computing speed is increased by tens or hundreds of times." Saying that he is in artificial intelligence At the time of the encounter, Heidi’s eyes were slightly blurred. “At that time, it was enough to compare with the mental arithmetic of the high-level magician and the intermediate-level auxiliary law!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Splint is a little surprised, the room for improvement in the surname can be so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded and said to the puzzled Natasha, Lazar, Katrina and others: "According to the artificial intelligence concept they designed, The bottleneck lies only on materials and devices, and the development of materials and devices is extremely dependent on the study of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a field that depends on each other In an era of promotion, such as the absence of a good auxiliary array, many experiments in the microscopic field cannot be completed, and development will become slow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe we can Applying the quantum superposition state to the field of artificial intelligence, the speed of its operation is increased beyond the level of any magician, including the Speaker of the Lord and me." Lucien painted the prospect of artificial intelligence, while silently added, no need Quantum computers, and other integrated circuits are fully mature, and large artificial intelligence can surpass the computing power of themselves and the Speaker of the Speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the magical world, there may be some steps in the middle that can be skipped directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond the computing power of the legendary magician..." Heidi said, she never thought that artificial intelligence could reach this level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their hearts, even if the legendary magician does not have the help of the auxiliary computing matrix, the mental arithmetic ability is enough to call it horror, which is a "non-human" level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellerstin listened quietly, and repeated two nouns in his heart: "Quantum superposition... artificial intelligence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha curiously looks at the flashing red and green light: "This artificial intelligence seems to be common to ordinary people... its size, weight and cost can be simplified to To what extent? How many years can I meet the requirements for promotion and popularization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has lived with Lucien for a long time, and she has been infected with widespread problems. After all, watching her own kingdom keep changing, watching her subjects enjoy more and more simple and civilized life, she will feel proud and proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you have a transistor, it should be only the size of the steel magic, and the big aristocratic family can use it, but if you want to shrink, you have to look at the alchemy material. Developed.” Heidi roughly predicted, “Although the alchemy devices and magic patterns in this artificial intelligence are relatively simple, ordinary magicians can do it, but they need a lot of devices and patterns, and they cannot be mass produced and assembled. In the case of the case, the cost is roughly equivalent to a five-level high-level magic item."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it still takes many years, but the computing power is the main Artificial intelligence estimates that there is no need for ordinary nobility and civilians.” Natasha is not disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled next to him, originally wanted to give examples of the "possible" application of computers in civilian life, but so far there is no corresponding prototype Appeared - such as TV, so it is inconvenient to speak directly, can only feel a little sense of the earth: "After the computing power is improved, a lot of things can be done, the world will become more colorful!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;En? Natasha looked at Lucien with curiosity, as did Heidi and Cherie, hoping to get inspiration from the teacher's mouth for the development of artificial intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, we can use artificial intelligence to draw a three-dimensional magic pattern, which will be more precise and stable than us, because it consists entirely of numbers." Lucien Deliberately talking about a topic that would be of interest to the magician, "Then we can let artificial intelligence build a spell model directly with these patterns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then Can artificial intelligence also cast spells on its own?” Heidi is very interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed: "The spell model requires energy perfusion to become a spell. We ourselves replace it with mental energy consumption, while artificial intelligence can use Electrical energy, but the problem is that its spell model is the same as the spell model in our soul. There is no entity. It must rely on the mental power to disturb the outside world. This kind of special electromagnetic wave, we have not yet mastered it, we can't make artificial intelligence. Also has the spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
