			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands of Lucien’s hands are unpretentious, introverted, faint and lustrous, but with a sacred and solemn taste, but let Leo body and voice The one that couldn’t help but tremble was not that it might be worth a lot of money, but that it was very familiar, like the huge sword that Ivanovsky had held while he was killing Lucien that night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leo, your eyes are good, this two-handed sword is called purifier, the last master is Ivanovsky. When he kills me I was killed by the other way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiles calmly and gently, not worried about the exposure of the "Purifier" sword I suspect that I know the existence of the Necromancer, because Ivanovsky at the time made everyone believe that he was chasing himself with excellent and superb "acting skills" instead of fleeing to the gap of the dead spirit at the bottom of the mine. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during his pursuit, it’s not surprising that he was killed in a remote mountain forest by his own terrain, pre-layout traps, powerful magic items, etc. Things, especially Nikonov, did not find traces of fighting at the bottom of the mine, nor did I see Ivanovsky in the dead, so the previous inference is the only "real" without a doubt. result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it is not easy for a middle-level magician to charm, hint, and control a determined knight, if I encounter Ivanov. If this kind of "interfering" blood is taken, it would be impossible. His anti-surname is very high, and combined with his own will, unless it is a high-level magician, it is possible to charm and control him, but he wants to ask him from his mouth that there is such a subconscious mind. The secret of the leak requires at least the nine-ring magic to “invade the mind”, otherwise it will be as conscious as a strong violation of the willingness to physically and mentally as if it were controlled by the person to commit suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the opposite is true. If Ivanovsky is caught, the possibility of copying this secret is extremely small. The big man behind him is also He will not be told about the existence and way of entering the world of the dead. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the highest theological conference against the list of the Pope’s saints and the list of cardinals of the “Pale Lord” Wilfrid, Lucien considers himself I have already stood in front of the secret door that can shock the whole world. I can see the problem in a vague way. I have a deeper understanding of the value of the dead spirit world. I understand that once I know the existence of the matter, I don’t say anyone else, at least The current Pope and the saints of the Northern Church will surely disguise themselves in disregard of their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lists, the Northern Church is clearly placed in front of the world, without worrying about people seeing it, because reading these two lists is really different. The premise of the place is that it must be clear that "The Lord of Pale" Wilfrid, although not missing, has a dark relationship with the missing legendary magicians. He has carried out some mysterious experiment and knows the existence of the dead world. I know that there are secrets about immortality hidden in the depths of the dead spirits, and most people who know these things can not guess the two lists and can guess some situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even if the Magic Council collected the historical data of the North and South Churches, they could not find anything from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo heard Lu Xien’s plain answer, although it was only middle-aged, but the face with deep wrinkles in his eyes became empty, like The meaning of being alive suddenly disappeared, and his hands trembled with the naked eye, showing his inner heart unable to calm the emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly looked at him, did not speak, after a full five minutes, Leo was emotionally reluctantly smiled: "Thank you, Master, you I avenge myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deep joy and deep regret, loss, and confusion in his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands his feelings very much, because if you change yourself, an enemy who killed his family is not killed by himself, and he witnessed his death. It will also be the same loss and regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The end of the death will pass..." Lucien slowly opened his mouth and prepared to comfort Leo a few words, while Leo interrupted the road with a bit of disorder. Sean’s words, "Master, please allow me to go quietly for a few minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien understanding and gently nodding, Leo goes next to a boulder Going, his pace seemed to be calm and steady, but after a few steps, he was almost stumbled by a small stone and a tree root, and the tall body stumbled forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien walked a few steps to the side, did not go to eavesdrop on what he prayed, and the knights who grew up in the country of the church, whether or not they truly believed in the truth, completely violated the Church’s Holy Scriptures, whether to do it or not. When you are in a state of anger, when they are not conscious, they will draw a cross and pray. This is a deep imprint of being evangelized from a young age and engraved in and out of the church by parents before being discerned. It is irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The childhood experience really affects everyone's behavior patterns...this can also be a direction of arcane research." Lucien thought divergently With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Leo slowly came back. He was a little tired and said: "Master, let's go, and quickly leave the Ural. The night watchman and the knight. They are looking around like mad dogs. If I haven’t smuggled them many times nearby, I’m afraid it’s hard to avoid them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has bitter, free, lost Complex emotions such as regret, sadness and joy reconverge back to the bottom of my heart, earnestly fulfilling the duties of my guide and doing my duty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he took out a pair of boots painted with dark gold patterns: "Master, this is the boots I picked up from the body of the magician, it seems that there are The ability to make short-range teleports."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dodge boots, three-level medium magic items, can increase the agility of the wizard to the level of the third-level knight, while each曰 Two three-ring magic 'short teleports'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien checked the boots, he smiled and agreed with Leo’s suggestion: "Okay. We walked straight through the Ural Mountains, the monsters here are still within my power, and I have a magician's hut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Lucy En also comforted him with a sentence: "Leo, when you get to Aalto, stay there and live, don't go back to the East, I think you should reconsider the matter of the descendants. This purifier's hands are huge. The sword you can hold first, it can come in handy when dealing with monsters in the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the word of the descendants, Ray The expression became complicated again, in this world of blood heritage strength, title, property and honor of the vast majority of their own people are the descendants of very high value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo seems to be thinking about what has taken over the "purifier", carefully looked at it again, and then carried it in front of Lucien open circuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The Spring of the Spring (April) is twenty o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage drove from the northern province of Tilan to the town of Massawa, which is only half a day away from Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blonde" Lucien, accompanied by "housekeeper" Leo, walked out of the carriage and stepped into the familiar hotel while looking around It seems crowded crowds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On April 9th, sacred calendar, I arrived from Aalto and arrived here. It was almost exactly three years before and after." Lucien Thinking with emotion, the heart feels a kind of affection, it seems to be the feeling of returning to the "hometown". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Ural state, Lucien and Leo all walked through the depths of the mountains and suffered many monster attacks, but they all had four rings. The magical strength was solved and the North Fortress was successfully arrived. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the North Fortress with two legendary strongmen "Glory of God" and "Chaotic Snake" guard, Lucien and Leo are far away from The towering snow peaks climbed past and entered the territory of the Vaolirit Principality, but it also delayed a lot of time. The trip that arrived at the end of March was delayed until late April. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masawa is a small town, not directly to the Grand Duke, so this hotel has nothing to pay attention to, the lobby is the restaurant, many accents are different, dress different The guests are dine, and there is no so-called aristocratic etiquette when they dine, talking to each other enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'Aalto Music Festival' is a lot worse than three years ago, but it can be regarded as a festival of mainland music, so I am reluctant to leave, and I stayed for more than a week.” A middle-aged man in a silk shirt who was obviously in a good position said to the three guests who had been at his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien only woke up after hearing this sentence, this year is the year of the Aalto Music Festival, but unfortunately he failed to catch up: "But this too Well, Natasha should come out from the bottom of the monastery, and she must contact her first. Would it be that the ability to go back as a musician is not the ability of the church to collect intelligence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
