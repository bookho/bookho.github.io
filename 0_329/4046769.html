			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic universe, top of the Tower of Babel. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire hall is covered with silver, light green and transparent lines that extend from walls, floors, ceilings, and voids to form a densely packed Complex magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of these lines converges continuously with a liquid that is full of vitality, just like the source of the hot springs, the berth flows around, the round offering The station is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the thriving greenery in the altar, Lucien laughed at Natasha around him: "The 'Nature Gift' ceremony is ready "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can this be different from what I heard from Hathaway's mother-in-law?" Natasha looked at the legendary ceremonies around him with great interest. component. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, she heard about the general picture of the "natural gift" ceremony from Hathaway, because it was Fernando and Douglas who presided over the ceremony. Hathaway, and this continuation of life's legendary ritual is centered on the "elf tree fruit", through the transformation of the magic array and the corresponding complex steps, extracting the power inside, in the form of a fantasy magic pattern and the soul of the subject Fusion with the body to achieve life-long endurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the top life ritual, according to the quality of the fruit of the genie tree, the quality of the ritual materials, the perfection of the ritual operation, and the strength of the subject. Can increase life from three thousand to six thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the hall is so different now, Natasha has neither seen the fruit of the elf tree nor found the corresponding magical array component - although she I don't understand a magical array, but the appearance of the magical array and the running irregularities required for the "natural gift" ceremony are very obvious and can be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that there will be no “pool water” similar to the hot spring in the center of the “natural gift” ceremony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien maintains a smiling expression: "You forgot, we still have 'no old spring', so I combined it with its special name, modified 'natural The gift 'ritual', although the quality of '不老泉' is not as good as the fruit of the elf tree, it can not raise the upper limit, but it can effectively raise the basic value. Therefore, the current 'natural gift' ceremony can last for 5,000 to 6,000 years. And can be used by two people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Not old spring'?" Natasha remembered Lucien’s harvest in the dead world, and then Looking at the hot spring water in the center of the magic ceremony, my heart suddenly relieved. "No old spring" should show this state. "You don't need to find Hathaway, the storm dominates the Lord and they preside over it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the legendary ceremonies are hosted by legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the "pool water" that integrated the power of "elf tree fruit" and "not old spring" and smiled: "No need, pass me The improved ritual does not require another legendary host. As long as there is a legendary magician among the subjects, it can effectively guide and control without any problems. It is a continuation of life that is simple, convenient, efficient and comfortable. Ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the last description of Lucien, Natasha couldn’t help but smile: "Haha, I believe now the voice of mystery." And the strange and fun advertising words in the 'World Real' channel are what you came up with..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did I not always frankly admit it? Lu Xi'an spread his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stopped the laughter and looked serious: "What do you do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, it’s like a hot spring bathing in the pool of the altar. The ritual will drive the spirit of the 'spiritual tree fruit' and 'not the old spring' to blend into our bodies." Lucien looked solemnly. "In order to ensure the effect, you can't wear any magic items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Natasha snorted, then smiled and said: "Need to take off and soak Ceremony? You won't be deliberate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that kind of person? This is the name of '不老泉'." Lu Xien A serious and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her speech, the lavender court dress she wore was like a floating butterfly moving slowly, and the rest of the clothes were flying, slow but full of temptation, revealing a beautiful body a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like every time you take a bath, Natasha stretches out his toes and points to the pool water, then walks step by step toward the center of the emerald pool, and the body is gradually being The surface of the water was submerged. Suddenly, she turned her head and looked at Lucien, who floated outside the altar. She smiled and smirked with a touch of charm: "Come, don't be shy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to pass very quickly, the green "pool" is getting less and less, Lucian and Natasha feel The liquid slowly blended into your body, blending into your own soul, bringing a clean, refreshing, ethereal and sleek feeling, and the whole person was completely relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ceremony has been solved, and as long as it is not interrupted, it will be completely successful. Even now, I feel that life has improved a lot. It’s been about four thousand years.” In a quiet atmosphere, Lucien suddenly said, because of the relaxation from the depths of the soul, the sound is lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha leaned on Lucien, and lazily said: "I feel the pressure, anxiety and worry about many things that are usually washed by spring water. Clean, well, I am going to find a time to host Rantart's 'Music Festival'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under such circumstances, she is thinking of what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Music Festival?" Lucian's voice was quite ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I always wanted to host a famous "Lentart Music Festival" on the mainland. It is my favorite for Aalto, but in the past few years, There are not many musicians who can get a lot of Tate, but they are rich in playwrights. Until this year, due to the foundation laid in previous years, a group of very good musicians emerged. I am ready to start this matter, huh, Affected by you, Rantart is more popular with light music and various unconventional symphonies. I hope this will be the difference between Rantart music and Aalto music..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although I like Aalto very much, Natasha has not changed the idea of ​​Rentat to the second Aalto. She respects the humanities and customs here. "At the time, I hope to use your "Valkyrie" "The opening of the opera as a 'music festival'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien underestimated the difficulty of opera creation, plus it was truly original and required to be refined, so until the electronic The double-slit interference experiment was completed before the time was nearly four years. Products, is looking for an opera singer and band rehearsal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a gift for you, you can see when you can see it." Lucien has no opinion, "but have to wait for the chaotic starry sky." 'Get the 'space-time slate' after."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ready, going to the endless abyss of the fifth hundred and fifty-five layers of chaos Starry sky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, all my attention is now on the endless abyss and the 'chaotic starry sky'..." Natasha sighed in satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the green "pool water" disappeared completely, and Lucien and Natasha were surrounded by a layer of light green translucent light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various parts of the surrounding magical rituals are all lit up, and the energy gathering together creates a huge and special pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent light shimmered and plunged into the soul and flesh of Lucien and Natasha, and the faint natural fragrance exuded from them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably extended life of 5,600 years." Lucien said according to the feedback of the ceremony and his own situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and said: "So, my pursuit of you will have a long enough 'schedule', not to be depressed in a short period of time and Admit defeat! I will be able to catch up with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her fist and "war" was high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Ivan, the capital of the Northern Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
