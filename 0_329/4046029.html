			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the article recorded by the witch in the state of excitement and trepidation, Lucien also felt an unspeakable shock, actually passing through. After discovering that this is a world of magic and magic, I have had some of these questions. It is just because there is too little knowledge, too little is known about magic, and I quickly forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is a magnificent, direct point to the ten questions of the world's origins and rules, let Lucien believe that if you can understand these problems, you should be able to understand The truth of the world, understand why you can cross, and find ways to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This great arcaneian called Douglas, even if he has not fully figured out any of these ten questions, as long as he studies on these issues With some progress, his strength must be exceptionally strong enough to match the ancient legendary magicians mentioned at the beginning of his article."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the journal, there are strange magicians who witches encounter. It seems that there is a place in the world where magic can be learned relatively safely. It seems that it is a bit strange, even the journals appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the world of magicians, what is the strength and status of the Arcanist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thinks a lot from the witch's memory and this article. The more I want to be more excited, I can't wait to meet the strange magician right away, go to a place where I can safely learn magic, etc. After a certain strength, return to Aalto and secretly help the Johns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, Lucien’s two most exciting, most anticipated and most confusing questions are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is the earth, fire, wind, and water really the basic elements? If so, in what form and what kind of law do they constitute such a wonderful world? If not, what are they? What should magic elements have?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why does the world have sun and silver moons, why do they rise and fall every day, what is the power to keep them running? The material world looks normal If we ask more questions, we will find that the reason we don't understand, whether these principles, laws and knowledge are related to magic, whether they can be combined with magic, can help us explore the essence of the magical world. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lucine’s opinion, if the first question is, the geothermal feng shui is indeed not the basic element, and the answer to the second question is The regular use of the material world and Close to the magic, it means that a large part of their own knowledge and learning of the main library inside knowledge of the past ten years, can come in handy in their own learning and use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can use it, then how much can this knowledge work? Lucien is not yet in contact with the world of magicians, and can only secretly speculate: " At least I have seen things like silver, copper and iron since this time. It is very likely that there are really 'elements', and apart from magic, magic, and every move in life, there have been no violations. The law of physics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you add mental power, soul, strange magical creatures, etc., this world gives me a kind of illusion with the earth. Feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart suddenly flashed an idea: “According to this, the reason why the books in the library cannot be opened, It may not be what I guessed before, it is very doubtful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired with anomalies, all kinds of thoughts kept coming up for a long time, Lucien gradually calmed down, He has matured a lot and understands that the most important thing is to be practical. To learn magic, we must not be unrealistic to dream, to chase now can not confirm things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter in which world, down-to-earth is a quality worthy of possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence of ideas, Lucien turned to the last page of the witch's notes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “After I have done meditation and experimentation, I often think of him. A knowledgeable and elegant man is always charming.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, he asked me to meet at the cemetery in the Adejan district."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, the witch’s magic note suddenly ended, and the back was full of blank sheepskin Paper, it seems that she and her magician friend were ambushed by the church's night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know if the magician escaped?" Lucien thought a little annoyed, but he was the only clue to find the "Continent Magic Council". Other legendary magicians hidden in Aalto, they simply don't know where to look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long breath, Lucien removed all the starry thoughts from his mind, and restored his mind to a clear, peaceful state, ready to try meditation. See if you can learn magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the record on the magic note, Lucien maintains a soft, long breathing rhythm that allows the spirit to diverge, slowly withdraw, then diverge, and then Slowly retracted until it entered a state of near ethereality and blankness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the witch’s own experience, she was identified as a magical talent from a young age, and her mental strength was good. She first tried meditation for the first time, but it took two years. Time only enters this ethereal, blank state, and the spiritual power grows to the extent of the "training magic apprentice" that can sense the surrounding magical elements in this ethereal state, and it is one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after becoming a trainee of magic apprentices, before going to the advanced formal magician, there is basically no hindrance in spiritual cultivation, and you can follow the meditation idea step by step. The difficulty in tempering mental strength and soul to the strength of the spell mark model is only how long it takes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women began to learn meditation at the age of ten, and became a trainee magic apprentice at the age of thirteen. By the age of fourteen, she crossed the threshold of the official magic apprentice and became high. The magician apprentice, she is very satisfied with her spiritual talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, because she was not good at parsing the magic structure and building the imprint model, she had to try to force the mental power to the level of the formal magician to force the construction. Unfortunately, at the apprentice level, the effect was already very poor. The witch was unable to reach the goal. So she hit the idea of ​​a rare magical potion, the Magic Gate, which was stronger than most high-order. The spiritual power of the magic apprentice is directly promoted with this magical potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a record of the witch, Lucien is slightly disappointed, feel that he can not rely on magic to deal with possible retaliating revenge in a short time, but Victor as Aalto is famous, often invited by the nobility, and the elegant people who have traveled in the upper class, after becoming their official students, in the absence of more value, except for the guy who is taking risks, most of the gang members It should not be bothering yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is also a vague expectation in Lucian’s heart, because Lucien has long noticed that his spiritual power has passed through the sewer. With a big breakthrough, you can even blur the way someone is tracking themselves, which may shorten the time to become a trainee magic apprentice to a few months, or weeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual situation, but completely out of Lucian's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucine’s mental energy that spreads like a wave of water spread out and recovered a few times, he found himself smoothly entering the A blank, ethereal state, the first meditation took less than thirty seconds to succeed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain this state of meditation, Lucien tried to extend his mental strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing different from what the eye sees, full of calm and heavy power, arrogant power, light and dissipating power, soft and continuous power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the four basic elements of earth, fire, wind, and water? My mental power has reached the level of apprenticeship apprenticeship!" Lucien was surprised. I almost couldn't keep my meditation state. "It's no wonder that the first meditation will succeed, but that's the harvest that comes to life and death. I am a magic apprentice now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Understanding the reason, Lucien calmed down with joy, maybe it will take a long time to learn the first informal magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just the four basic elements of the land, fire, wind, and water. How do you feel closer to the state of force?" Lucien is prepared to follow the "Stars and Elements." In the book, the apprentice-level element meditation, before borrowing the feng shui to temper the soul and mental power, the mind did not feel this question, and then think of the Douglas problem, Lucien began to doubt, "Perhaps, this is the universe. Four basic forces, universal gravitation, weak nuclear power, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear power? Can the latter three be different manifestations of force?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
