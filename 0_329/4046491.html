			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxis looked down on Lucien and revealed a hint of alert between his looks. Why is such an important thing just to become a "secret prayer"? Leviathan, the seventh disciple, did not worry that he was a spy, and came in to help the evil god Anantans find the traces of the great flame and the god of destruction. At least one year of the test period will be spent, confirming that he has no problem and then actually let him participate in the core business negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the double high-pressure control of the city of Beiltan, the great power of the high priests and the heroes of the gods, the members of the "secret" are very careful because Carelessly, I have already died, and even brought serious damage to the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you suddenly discuss this issue, I remember the last 'evangelism' plan was not long?" An Hughes looked at the disciple's first saga Each road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob keeps the small gray rose pattern on the corner of the clothes, whispering: "This is the order issued by the 'Golden Crown', we are quietly waiting for his arrival. "<冕 <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The crown", the leader of the secret prayer society, the god of the god of fire and destruction, also claims to be the embodiment of his coming, the father and the son are two, and the road The disciples, such as Sean, are called "passers" and those who spread the commandments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Hughes eased his expression and sat on a silver seat with a flame pattern interwoven into the "Five" of Baal, Lucien Other disciples, either looking at or guarding or indifferently, also learned how Anxius looked, and did not panic and walked to the silver chair of "seven", as if at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leviathan, listening to Norton said that you are born with great strength, you can compete with the worst blood, is it?" Jacob's face is messy They are all white beards, so people can't see his expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other disciples gazed at the dark red round table, as if they didn’t hear Jacob’s question, and did not expect Lucien’s answer, this level of Although Lux is rare among human beings, it is not without precedent. It can be said that it can compete with the worst blood-stained person, and it only refers to the strength. Once the blood-blooded person uses the "extraordinary power" from the blood, he uses magical spells. The natural change of the escapement, the powerhouse and the ordinary people are no different, the same is rapid death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s appearance at this time is an ordinary black-haired man, no different from the general Baal, smiling and replied: “I don’t have Fighting with the blood of the gods, it is not clear about the specific gap, but it can deal with the general monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original reason why the injured was in the wild When it comes to horror monsters, they escape by natural power, and the power from the knights really surprises Norton who can only cast spells. This may be one of the reasons why he recommended Lucien to be the seventh disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob’s back is straight, his eyes and tone are not changed: “The future kind of 'spirit of the soul’ can be biased in this respect. The power of defensive skin against swords and spears, and very fast speeds, just as the evil god Anantans had lost his father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The master of war, Annathans, is the son of the god of the sky in the creation of the Anglomal Empire. He is half-god and half-human, and his power is infinite. The sharp knife and sword are cut on the body, leaving at most white scratches. After he killed the nine monsters that were plagued by the empire, he was blamed by the god of the sky in the house of the gods. Then he violently resisted and killed the father and boarded the position of the god of the Angloma. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But before that, you need to use your power to make enough dedication to the Great Flame and the Lord of Destruction." Lucien answered before Jacob. I continued, as he did when he inspires every important member of the secret church, who has not yet acquired the spiritual family to become an important member of the disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the secret hall is filled with the blazing heat, as if the fire came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob is the first to stand up and bow down: "Welcome to the 'crown'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest The disciples also followed the line, and Lucien also assessed the approximate level of the breath. If the "crown" is an unreserved release, to shock the "passers", then his strength should have seven levels. However, this breath is rather eccentric. It is neither a spiritual suppression nor a powerful will, but not a sacred pressure. On the contrary, it is like a "hybrid" in which all three are integrated. There is nothing outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the early days of the Twilight War, the remaining magicians were ran by the truth gods, and they did not understand the situation of the false gods, but the existence of the dead soul dominated Vicente, and the parliament later got it from the southern church. A lot of information about pseudo-god. Lucian has insufficient authority and limited understanding. But he probably knows that the false god can separate his own power to make an avatar, or come to the Son of God who has his blood. The strength of the avatar is lower than his own level. If this level The number of incarnations is up to two. If you want to create more, you can only reduce the strength of the incarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the secret confession claims to be the main sect of the god of fire and destruction, Lucian speculates that the only son of Afando used to control this hidden sect, the only incarnation Should belong to the strongest type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young and beautiful brunette man came out from the secret room of the stone hall, dressed in a large white robe with olive wreath on his head, bare The skin outside seems to have a layer of illusory flame flowing at any time, which makes the muscles of the knots strong and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The melee should be strong, with some spell-like abilities, closer to the Cavaliers, no, equal to the mighty devil in hell." Lucien showed from him The things that come out are roughly judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The crown" El Ring looked at the seven disciples in a circle, sat on the golden throne, then pressed down with his right hand, indicating that everyone sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our country is encroached by evil spirits, our 'children' are maimed by pagans, and our peers are less and less, but we still keep our Blood, our Father, still yearning for His holy mountain residence, so our successors are constantly flowing, and devout young people are constantly adding in. Leviathan, I hope that you can become a strong man guarding the gates of the Holy Mountain. I hope that you can spread the majesty of the Father to the hearts of other Balial people." On behalf of the "God of Fire and Destruction", El recognized the status of the seventh disciple of Lucien, after all, the Anglosoma was adopted by the Anglos With strong control, talent is becoming more and more difficult to obtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road was thanked, El looked at the seven disciples below: "Today, we are convening everyone to discuss our future path. You should have discovered There are fewer and fewer resistance activities on the peninsula. There are fewer and fewer Baristians who are willing to believe in the Father. Do you know what ideas and opinions you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"They forgot the majesty of the gods, no longer fear the flames and destruction, we want them to remember the fear in this soul, remember the coming flames, so that they can be great for the Afando And fight." An Hughes said harshly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See other disciples swearing to agree with Ann Hughes, Lucien shook his head slightly, and this secret seems to be still in the most primitive dependence on fear. The stage of missionaryism, rather than a mixture of salvation gifts, good yearning, post-mortem judgment, and punishment for the death of the world, the mature religious model with salvation, intimidation, good virtue and spiritual sustenance as the core, has not adapted to the current situation, and then In this way, believers will only become scarcer and be completely destroyed by the Angloma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a flame jump in El's eyes, he whispers: "Proclaiming the greatness of the Father is our responsibility, but the methods and means of evangelism, I I think that changes should be made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, Lucien and other disciples looked at El, but the meaning of doubt in the eyes was completely different, he also thought Want to change the means of current missions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El’s voice is full of enthusiasm: “Currently, the children and subjects of the Father are full of pain under the rule of the pagans, and we use fear again. It is impossible to drive them into their hearts. What they need is redemption. What is needed is redemption from this pain. So tell them that death is not terrible. It is only returning to the holy mountain residence of the Father. Eternal peace and happiness, and their sacrifice will also build a holy nation on the ground for their children, so that negative things such as war, killing, fear, hatred, etc. will be removed from each other, and only such a holy country can escape the future flame. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, those who have forsaken the Father will also be punished, they will be given a fair trial, suffering unspeakable suffering in the kingdom of the dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The glory of the Father is not limited to the Baal, He is merciful and kind, and He accommodates any alien who is willing to believe in Him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen Seoul words, Lucien is a little daze, which is already quite mature religious concept, and began fascinating abstract, universal god evolution, god of fire and destruction Taichetaiwu after suffering a huge defeat from the family of God, the region? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
