			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before stepping into the "Longbaigen" hotel, Lucien thought about it and took the magic badge down, leaving only the four-star arcane badge. Take a pair of gold-rimmed glasses from your pocket and put on two shiny, shiny chains that hang over a slightly thin face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being recognized by Prince Holt Patrick, Lucien bought a pair of glasses without any degree in Aringe to see outsiders Slightly disguised. Although it is probably late, it is better than doing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bow tie, and Lucien stepped into the "Long Bogen" hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the hotel, the sun shines through the glass window, showing a quiet and splendid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two male and female two beautiful blond elves are sitting on the corner sofa waiting for the visitors of the Magic Council, surrounded by several equally elaborate elf guards And the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire hotel lobby, except for them, has only the boss and the waiter, and no other guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, the 'Elemental Order' Lucien Evans is said to be not only the youngest Holm crown winner, but also a fourth-level arcane Teacher, his magical strength should be close to high-level, what should we do?" The beautiful and delicate female elf asked with enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally thought that she would follow the teacher to join the research team composed of high-level arcaneists. At that time, there were many people who secretly changed the land environment and tamper with some experiments. The data can achieve the goal, and the result is temporarily assigned to the "supposedly" talented, the study of elemental magic can be compared with the high-level arcane masters of the Holm crown award winners, the number is small, he is the experimental main force It is too obvious to want to do some hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that Lucien’s reputation plays its full role, the Magical Parliamentary Committee deliberately forgot the Lucifer’s magical level in the information of the Druids, and The legendary magician's professional name gave him a loud nickname. Originally intended to be called "elemental cycle", but Florenza disliked a bit of a mouthful, not aggressive, it is difficult to shock these elves, after several discussions, finally identified as "elemental order", the corresponding Felipe did not conceal the magic level Just a nickname "Resurrection". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ellestin, don't be pessimistic. First of all, we can cooperate with each other, and the devil's mark is deliberately omitted. Secondly, since we are the main force of the experiment, then When you record key data, you can make mistakes in a bright and honest way.” Elf Prince Eksi Lyon replied more calmly, with deep dislike on the face of human beings who destroyed nature. “At the same time, we delay the time as much as possible. Uniting with other elders to overthrow the opposition, and then exerting pressure on the elders together, perhaps we will be able to return to the fresh and beautiful forest soon after."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin Sitting on the sofa, quietly smiled: "I hope we can help to keep the green and clean nature. But human life inventions are actually quite good, such as these sofas are soft and have a surname, sitting very comfortable. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion's face became serious: "Ellerstin, don't forget that these sofas are made of human felled trees. I seem to have heard the trees." Crying Don't fall into the enjoyment! Is there anything more comfortable and happier than sitting on a tree full of vitality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't expect a little sentence The sigh was reprimanded by my brother, and Elsett was slightly depressed, but still nodded: "Brother, I will not forget the gift of nature and the elf tree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She quietly clenched her fists, and must crush the evil human claws that stretched out to nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they saw a medium-sized young man coming into the door of the hotel. He was wearing a white shirt, a dark vest, and a double-breasted long dress. Wearing a tall black top hat on his head and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on his face, the whole person looks gentle and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as humans are concerned, he is good and temperament is good." The elf prince and princess subconsciously assessed each other's looks, which is customary. After the appearance of the above level, the most basic reaction to human society, but their eyes quickly transferred to the right ring of the other hand inlaid with a beautiful ring of lilac gemstones, its unique shape has been passed to the information of the Magic Council. they. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, is His Royal Highness Prince Exeter and Princess Ellerstin?" Lucien greeted him with a high hat and said he was secretly grateful to the committee members who assigned him the task. Because Felipe's strength is obviously higher than himself, so the higher level of the druids that want to be troubled is assigned to his group, leaving only the honor of his own, the strength is four and three The prince and princess of Rui, with the "element" ring, can stabilize themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for their privileged identity, Lucien is not an elf, and naturally it exists as a grass paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, their Elf Guards are more powerful, according to the mission intelligence, there is a seven-level magic archer Angst, a six-level elf Knight Tyrrell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of etiquette, temperamental elegance, Lucian, Exeter and Elstin also responded with court etiquette: "Yes, we are from Member of the Struman Elf King Court. Are you the 'Elemental Order' Mr. Lucien Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s mouth is almost open Forgot to close, is this domineering nickname belongs to yourself? Ms. Florenza really suspects that her strength is not low enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returned to God, Lucien gestured and asked the two elves to sit down: "His Royal Highness, Princess Royal Highness, we have to wait for two members to start The study of the magic. The 100 acres of land in the southeast of the town belong to us, fertile and barren, so it is a good comparative experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Contrast experiments.” For the obvious professional vocabulary, Exxon and Ellers have some headaches. Anyway, their purpose is to delay, so they shift the topic and talk to Lucien about music, painting, sculpture and other art. Fortunately, they are faced with "genius musicians" who have long been involved in the art circle. The two sides talked about their happiness and there was no cold spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of Lucien’s own bias, the final topic is basically focused on music. The natural music from the elves’ tens of thousands of years has given Lucien a great Experience, with a lot of inspiration, and Lucien's rigorous and emotionally-themed music also touched the two elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most valuable of your human beings are musicians, painters, sculptors, drama writers, etc. Art is the best reward for nature, unlike The nobility and the magician will only destroy nature." When it comes to the rise, Exeter seems to have forgotten that it is the winner of the Holm crown award, the "authority" of the elemental magic field, and regards him as an artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked down at the chest of the arcane badge, secretly sighed that these two prejudices are really serious, the first thing humans have to satisfy is survival. In such a different world filled with magical creatures, if there are no aristocratic knights, no magicians, no pastors, etc., human beings cannot exist, not to mention art, and human beings are not like elves with magical patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien was absent-mindedly interpreting two elves who talked about the surname, the two magicians came in at the door, one was wearing a black hooded robes. The old man, the chest arcade badge is five silver stars on the black background, the magic badge is the silver ring, and the other is the middle-aged yellow-haired man in a night dress. The arcane level is four, and the magic level is three. Level, this is the other two members of the Lucian experimental team, Theodor and Yurian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After introducing each other, the young Teodore said with a loud voice: "I didn't have breakfast for the sake of coming over, I don't know if I can fill it out first." Full stomach? I am the kind of person who can't work if he is hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of delaying time, Exxon is very much in favor, elegant Laughing: "I didn't have any meal with Elsett in the morning, Mr. Evans, is it better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of the two magicians made him wake up Evans, with artistic temperament, is an "elemental order" and a genius genius magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smugly agreed to nod, they want to delay the time, why don’t you want to hold them on their side, don’t let them go around, anyway, as a quasi-knight My own food intake has always been good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the hotel’s restaurant, Lucien cuts the sausage with a knife and fork, while the next to Theodore and Yurian Eat three bloody three ripe steaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Ellerd put down the knife and fork, his face is very difficult to see: "Why do you humans have to ruin other creatures to satisfy their desires? Are there any mistakes in animals such as sheep, to be slaughtered by you, to be eaten by you? And they are also friends of mankind! You have been destroying nature, but you don’t understand its tolerance, and will eventually be punished by nature!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
