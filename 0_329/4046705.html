			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovey as an assistant listened curiously: "Reconstructing the auxiliary computing matrix based on normal thinking and computational logic? Lord Evans, thinking and real However, it is quite complicated, and this is also inconsistent with the requirements of universalization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the regular meeting, Lucien allowed everyone to speak freely, but must raise their hands. This is to cultivate an inspirational brainstorm, and it is also a promotion to oneself. After all, what is the result of my own research so far, Lucian is very clear that he can’t relax himself. Instead of improving magic and alchemy items, Lucien thought it was excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complex steps can be simplified. Any calculation is broken down into steps, and the process of thinking is the same. I have such an idea, decompose 曰Frequently think, escape, and calculate the process, find the most simplified steps they have in common, store them in the auxiliary computing matrix in the form of commands, and then reorganize a complete process by applying them. Simulating most of the situation.” Lucian did not lead the students, but proposed this idea himself, because this is beyond the current foundation and trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celly listened with gusto: "It feels very interesting. If the auxiliary computing matrix can only simulate most of the situation, then is it possible to simulate the wisdom more realistically?" Life? If you don't know, talk to 'it', can't you tell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you simulate smart life without soul?" Plint felt that Cherie thought too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi gave her a look and maintained her research partner: "What is impossible, just simulation, pre-set responses are enough, then it is very It’s hard to tell.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya frowned: “Everyone’s reaction to one thing requires a combination of very complex factors that may not really simulate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien gently decapitated: "Interesting ideas, if you are interested in yourself, you can study in this area, if the auxiliary computing array is true The situation has improved to the extent of artificial intelligence, and then the integration of alchemy life, what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence is said, Lucien The black pupils of the eyes flashed a fascinating emotion, would it be Skynet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina listened quietly beside him, asking a question in a timely manner: "Teacher, break the complicated process into steps and then reorganize according to specific speeds. Is it too much trouble? The time for the auxiliary computing matrix to complete such a process is enough for us to do the same thing several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For "Artificial Intelligence" Phrases, they can be understood literally, but there is no ambiguity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the research project left for you." Lucien laughed. "I have a preliminary idea. Since we can control differently through circuit design." The lighting combination can be equally used in the improvement of the auxiliary magic array? The circuit has two states of switching, can it be used to represent information only by these two states, just like many magicians have made strange passwords before?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circuit design is not a new term since the electromagnetic system was separated from the elemental system. Many magicians applied it to the improvement of their magical array power channel. With the increase in the magical array of water energy conversion, the infrastructure of wire erection began to be carried out on a large scale. The invention of magic crystal lamps, many alchemy items that need electric power, came out, and even the ordinary civilians knew what it was, and therefore A new profession attached to it was born, such as "circuit maintenance engineer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proliferation of electromagnetic communication has also led to more and more encryption methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi is delighted to say: "The speed of the current is very fast, maybe it can really complete the complicated process in a short time, how can we control the switching of one circuit?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It only uses the two states of the switch to represent all the information..." Cherie thinks about the binary problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s question about Heidi shook his head: “How to control? This is what you need to study. I think it can be done from both magic and alchemy materials. Some of the elements newly discovered before have a special conductive surname, you can look it up, in this respect, Katrina and Reyia are authoritative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing the teacher's expression, Katrina and Reyiaya squinted and shook their heads: "It's not authoritative, but the experimental materials are more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Modesty is a good thing, but you must have confidence in yourself. Who is willing to participate in this artificial intelligence direction?" Lu Xien asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Research on the improvement of the auxiliary computing matrix" became the "investigation of artificial intelligence direction" and suddenly it was on the high-end atmosphere. This is everyone. The must-have "skill" of experts who are good at defrauding funds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi and Cherie have been doing research in this direction outside the elemental and atomic fields, and are interested in hearing the name of "artificial intelligence." So they raised their hands, Katrina and Reyia wanted to remnant, but the research projects in their hands required a lot of experiments, experimenting over and over again to get some results, and learning new alchemy, relativity and other knowledge. It is really powerless to improve the magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint and Annick are not interested in this direction, they are completely caught in the microscopic "new alchemy" field and macro "relativity" closest to the world "What else is more interesting than exploring the mysteries of the world?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Evans, I am interested, can I participate in research in this direction as an assistant?" Lovi asked with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia itself is Heidi’s assistant, and also has a good relationship with this cheerful, big-eyed girl, so apply to join, Black naturally chooses Followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular meeting continues, deepening the atomic research institute's own position - the micro "new alchemy" field, each person reports his own experimental data and conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels" "Mecan Tron" looks gloomy Walking in the "world of the door", suddenly, the gray in front of him condensed, the old man with white hair appeared, and the corner of his mouth smiled and said: "Returned from the holy city of Reims?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mecan Tron" looked at the "monster" Viken: "How can someone get to the paradise hill? Are you looking for a good candidate? No longer stunned like the previous Sarde. And throw it to me after the projection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salde can't infer things from the clues, of course I can only throw you 'boots', this time not The same, Lucien Evans is the one who got the shackles, and it is easy for him to meet Maskillin. The clues are connected and the results are not disappointing." "Monster" Wicken laughs Dao, "Is it not good? This partner can have more potential for Pizza, and the strength behind it is much stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is because of this I am not at ease. After the removal of Viken, the Magic Council will continue to preserve the truth and teach us to develop our faith. I am afraid they will marry the paradise..." "Mecan Tron" is still sullen, "You Why not project him in his body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monster" Wicken keeps a secret smile: "I can't see Lucien Evans, he is It seems that I have something that I am very afraid of, so I dare not project it, and the breath of silver moon is on him. Even if it is projected, it will be expelled when He descends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Silver Moon?" "Mecan Tron" was astonished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster gently nodded: "How can Silver Moon not take the opportunity to spy on the secret of immortality? The hell guy is also following! I am hoping more people to see The secret of immortality, so lazy to control them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mecan Tron" was even more surprised: "Is the Lord of Hell also coming?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mecan Tron, do you think that Lucien Evans is running in himself? Do you think that the legendary magicians of the Magic Council are so bad? Lin can sneak into the soul fireplace, but they 'crash' the room of the Holy Spirit of the Northern Church... Coincidence can only explain the inevitable reason behind it." The monster sneered, though he could not do without the "world of the door", The matter of the "Death of the Dead" can still be explored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mecan Tron silenced, coldly said: "The legendary undead in the dead spirits seems to be more than just a relationship with the northern church, but also with hell. The main hook is on the..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
