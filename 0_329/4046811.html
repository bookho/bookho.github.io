			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Coastal Corridor is a ridiculous land to the north, and the cold-resistant woods and strange terrain have turned it into a werewolf, ice bear and other creatures. Paradise, and even more powerful magical creatures linger in the depths of this vast land, such as Yinlong, Bailong, Frost Giant Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the road to the East Exiles is a result of the pioneers of adventures, avoiding the most dangerous areas, but walking around Caravans and pedestrians on the roads often encounter various attacks, which make the Northland a bloody chaos, known as the paradise of the desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the month of the ice, this area has long been covered with a white scorpion, even if the evergreen trees are covered with pure white gauze, at first glance, I can't see a trace of variegation at all, and if I stare at them for a long time, I can't even open my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road where the car marks have not been covered by the snow of the sky, a group of shocking blood is blooming, and discarding The long swords, spears, and giant hammers indicate the fierce battles that have taken place here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the footprints of the earth, leaving the boulevard and continuing northward, you will see a virgin forest that cannot be seen at the margin, and deep in the forest, there is A hidden gap leading to the ground, at the end of it is a rather wide underground cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground cave, a torch is inserted on the stone wall, making the whole place bright and bright, but the flames burning on these torches are extremely weird. It is pale, as if there is no temperature, no soul, no death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale light sprinkled from the torch and shone in the black robes of the ground in the cave, setting them off with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes are close to the ground, and the characteristics of the body and the side face can be clearly judged that they are not all belong to the human race, the werewolves with long cheeks, each have The beasts with obvious beasts and the frost giants occupying a large area...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are motionless, like dead bodies. And the center of their worship is a bone On the altar of the base, a black robes with eyes that seemed to have a pale flame jumping stood in front of the altar, quietly watching the mysterious patterns that radiated a rich sense of death, watching the symbolic life harvest on the altar. Giant sickle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Birth means the beginning of death. That is the ending we can never escape..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The black robes raised their hands violently, whispering inexplicable prayers, and the top of the altar swelled up a group of silent burning flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Birth means the beginning of death...···”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are like corpses The black robes finally moved, and the voice of hoarse and hoarseness caused their bodies to tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the front of the high priest is mysterious, and the extreme fanaticism is extremely cold: "Compared with the length of death, life is meaningless, Only darkness, coldness, and death are the eternal themes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will eventually fall into decay. Our souls can only be avoided by entering a country of death and sleep. Slowly dying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s gaze gradually became empty: “Today we will offer sacrifices to my Lord, and also present our own lives, let the soul Get back and let it live forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to dedicate my life to the Lord, in exchange for the support of the soul..." Those black robes seem to be hypnotized, and the voice numbs without answering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing their answer, the high priest was relieved with a long sigh of relief, and he sent a group of devout believers to the Lord to let the true meaning of death get Highlighting, and according to the Lord's "Soul Sacrifice", such a self is getting closer and closer to the Lord, and will gradually get rid of the mortal body and soul and turn into a true death messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, you will be doubled in life and soul, becoming a powerful presence comparable to legendary magicians and epic knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a sign that is getting closer and closer to the Lord. I have been able to vaguely sense the great sacred death paradise. When my induction of it becomes very clear, I am given the opportunity to be detached in essence!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sleeping humans around the altar woke up, some of them were dressed in gorgeous, some were covered with leather, and there was nothing to do with the caravans on the North Road trade route. the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?" Some people panic and blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn robber, will you pay for attacking us?" Some people are still in an angry state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I beg you to let us go, goods and money are all for you, and killing us is useless to you." Some people from around The eccentricity of the eccentricity was noticed and the whole body shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest looked up, and the deep, dark eyes blew a pale flame, and when they saw the two flames, those humans were paralyzed. I can't make a sound anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the middle of the altar and give life to the Lord." The high priest issued a sound that the plate did not fluctuate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of these merchants and mercenaries were pale and full of fear, but they were completely unable to resist the orders of the high priests, stood up in a magical way, and could not help themselves. Go to the center of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who first walked to the pale flame trembled and picked up the black giant python, his eyes full of fear, fear, despair and madness, but his The hand still used this huge cockroach, which seems to have no weight, to open the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sputum on his throat, but no drop of blood spurted out, the whole body quickly withered, and the skin became wrinkled in a short time. The corpse was dried, and there seemed to be something transparent in his body that was thrown into the "white flame." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale flames are a little higher, and the edge of the black sickle has a trace of dark red near black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest feels a kind of heartfelt pleasure, which is more than any experience of enjoyment, even if there is no strength to enhance and the Lord’s reward, this pleasure Can make him eager to hold the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of death that is faintly visible in and around the mind becomes clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My sublimation has gone further, closer to the Lord..." The high priest whispered to himself, but the entire underground cave did not Who pays attention to his gaffe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacrifice of one's own life, so that the pale flame is growing stronger, seems to jump out of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, show your piety, life is short, death is eternal!" The high priest turned sharply and said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of a black robes has changed. Fanatic: "I am willing to dedicate my life to the Lord, in exchange for the support of the soul..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This avid atmosphere makes the death sickle seem to be inductive, making a creaking sound, flying from the altar and hovering over the top of the underground cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am willing to dedicate my life to the Lord, in exchange for the soul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black robes once again prayed in unison, but no longer answered, but a request from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sharp red python that absorbs all the light, making the entire underground cave dark, and only the central pale flame is not affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant scorpion suddenly fell, just fell into the pale flame. At this time, those black robes were in perfect motion, and their eyes lost all brilliance. What seems to be there? Important things are sucked into the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale flame expands and floods the entire underground cave, and the skins of those black robes begin to rot, and the dark red flames in the eyes jump for a moment. It turned into an undead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
