			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Six Mans Station Platform Parcel Depository. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman looks good and shows a polite smile: "Hello, can you help me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a suitcase that needs to be parked here, waiting for me to return from Allinge." Ramiro smiled with ease and a hint of mint in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a specialty of the Kingdom of Buriana, called "Mint", not used for sucking, but dried by secret techniques. Chewing directly can refresh your mind and intoxicate like a cigarette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman smiled and said: "A few days in the deposit? Are you a magician?" As the ordinary female surname of Rentatt, I can find such a reward and relative The leisurely career, all benefited from listening to the "Sound of Mystery", eliminating the prejudice against the magician, dare to come to the application, and successfully emerged from a very small number of competitors, so she is full of goodwill to the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just an ordinary magician, well, three days in the deposit, forget it, or pay the money for seven days, can you repay more?" Ramiro said without hesitation, and there was no rush of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman smiled thoughtfully: "No problem, check the package for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After listening to the "Sound of Mystery" and working on the platform of the Six Mans, she realized that the original magician was not as rich as she imagined, and there was no shortage of strengths and arcane research that could only barely sustain life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiro is like a normal passenger, handing over a black suitcase in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female surnamed staff did not care. In accordance with the training process, the suitcase was placed in the magic array behind the large alchemy device, and then the switch was pressed. Start with power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simplified alchemy item developed by the “Elemental Gifts” company, which is used to check things such as parcels. After simplification, it can already be excited by electric energy. It can also be used by ordinary people, so it is promoted in the magic steam train platform, Nexus Palace, the villas and manors of the big nobility, the concert hall, the opera house, the city hall and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking to make sure there are no curses and dangerous items inside, the young woman opened the suitcase and opened it again, and found that most of it was ordinary clothing, and a small part was Tobacco from Burriana, and a piece of light black meat wrapped in ash and cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specialty beef?" she asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro’s mouth twitched: “Well.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“One day a silvernar A total of seven." The young woman put the suitcase together, put the sign on it, and placed it on the corresponding luggage rack in the back warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came back, Ramiro took out seven shiny silver coins and let them fall from the fingers to the counter and listened with their eyes open. That crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your receipt, please collect it and settle it according to the actual number of days." The female surname staff respectfully put the receipt with the seal on it. Ramiro - This is an ink pad blended with a special magic potion that can only be forged by a formal magician, but they will not do this for this little money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro picked up the receipt and looked at it, his mouth continued to chew on the tobacco and nodded slightly: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he put his hands in his long dress pocket and walked to the platform of the magic steam train. When he approached a silver-black trash can, his right hand suddenly came out and threw a piece of carbonized paper into it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black paper slowly falls, and when it is hit by the wind, it breaks into countless tiny butterflies, and no trace can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Ramiro turned into the bathroom, and the inside was easily and carefully examined the surrounding environment. After confirming that there was no prying and other people, he was right. The mirror pinched the face, and the whole person suddenly squirmed like a ooze. In just a few seconds, it became a beautiful young lady with a sturdy body and a black double-breasted body. The dress also turned into a light purple cake skirt with a flowing ruffle on the collar and cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aviline" is naturally impossible to answer him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished the clothes and put on a wide-brimmed hat with a beautiful long ribbon, and Ramiro left the bathroom with an elegant and dignified pace. , board the magic steam train that just arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Averina, are you coming back from Burrian?" A young man stood up from his seat in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamiro smiled stunnedly: "Yeah, Ariel’s arcane development has been too fast recently, and I have been waiting for Buriana to keep up. The pace of the times, so I am back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is great, your boyfriend Lavrov?" Young men attentively asked "Ivy Lena" sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiro reveals a sad expression: "We have separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? "Young men try to restrain their joy and pretend to be very sad and comforting. "It doesn't matter, there is better waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramiro "Sadly" looked at the platform slowly retreating, listening to the whistle of the whistle and the jingle of the iron wheel collision track, my heart was dark: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He in the end Who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avarina is not in the memory of being controlled...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The "quiet melancholy" made the young man intoxicated and couldn't speak. The time passed quickly and the magic steam train gradually climbed to Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Aringe was locked, Ramiro’s eyes lifted slightly and felt the power of the lock sweeping over himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alinhe is as tight as expected, although it is still as open as the ordinary city, but the secret inspection has become quite strict, still Your own "physical control" ability makes you equal to the real "Ivelina." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic steam train stopped on the platform, and Ramiro just left the carriage and saw the magic tower of the distant parliament headquarters lit up with starlight, bright and dazzling, enough The red beauty in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with this?" Ramiro recognized what it was, but he was puzzled to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked carefully: "Like the well-arranged 'gate of the outside world', the lord who explored the mysterious space came back so soon? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, you will know." Ramiro smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be an opportunity, but it is a coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such an opportunity, Ramiro will not give up, can become the thirteenth vigil, and pressure several strong players, he Relying on direct and decisive, pointing to the core of the action, so those who are used to bending around, plot plans, I can not think of him, so it is so hands-on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only 2.7 seconds..." Ramiro said to himself, this is the reaction of Aringe's locks in the current situation of not fully opening. Time, can you seize this time difference to kill Lucien? Evans did not have much confidence, he could only act on the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Tower of the Parliament Headquarters, in the 32nd floor hall, Standing on the door of a five-meter-high three-meter-wide illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its foundation is a complex magical array encrusted with countless gems and precious materials, a ray of starlight radiating from above, surrounded by a lot of magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, why did you mobilize so many high-level magicians and masters?" Lucien found out that he had arrived and had not received any news beforehand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is still wearing a long red magic robe, his face is dignified: "The world is a normal race, but the environment is special, and every corner is filled with strange feelings. Let our spiritual field be greatly suppressed, even Douglas can only sense the range of three hundred meters around, and the world is divided into numerous small blocks by the semi-cured space barrier, which has no effect on ordinary people, or the whole The world can mean that the legendary magician can't fly at all. If you accidentally hit the semi-cured space barrier, it is very easy to be seriously injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
