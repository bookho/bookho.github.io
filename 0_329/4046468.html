			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience in the room looked at each other in the dim candlelight, and did not understand what happened. Previously, because of "technical failure", the host jam, etc. There has been a short pause, but this has never been such an inexplicable change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the escapement radio is an apprentice who is affiliated with the Holmes Kingdom branch of the Magic Council. He is responsible for promoting the radio and secretly developing the audience. At this time he is elongated. The serious face reveals a smile that seems to be absent, so that Mr. Felipe, who is cold and tyrannical, talks about adolescent development problems, no wonder he will anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, a short electric current came out. Before the middle-aged man was ready to adjust the magic antenna, the sweet voice of "Night" sounded again: "Sorry, To the audience, I would like to express my most sincere apologies. Our guest, Mr. Felipe, had to leave early because of the sudden emergency in the family. We let another Mr. Ricardo, who is good at the human body, explain the development of adolescence and The problem of psychological change..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is still sweet, but it can reveal a hint of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, isn’t Mr. Felipe explaining it?" Scarlett still likes to listen to Feili’s low voice wearing a magnetic surname, especially like that. A faint polite tone, so after hearing the words of "nightingale", it is difficult to disappoint the attitude of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her friend Selma looks handsome and petite, and her face is also obviously disappointed, but then she suddenly said: "Mr. Felipe is so How can a proud person say the body...a question...no wonder he will be angry and not talk, angry and leave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she licked her face Curious and excited: "But if Mr. Felipe is really concerned about this aspect, it must be fun and fun, will he blush? What is the mood? Hey, he is so cute when he is angry, it is cold and proud. Mr. Felipe!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cute... The owner of the house smoked his mouth, if the cold Mr. Felipe heard his image in the eyes of the girl’s audience I am afraid that he will vomit blood more than the developmental topic just now. Well, most of them will really vomit blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the excitement, Selma suddenly screamed: "Will Mr. Felipe not come in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be, the next issue is not the topic..." Scarlett is not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andy and others have already heard their eyes shining, although their faces are hot, their developmental problems are satisfying their long-standing curiosity. And let them emerge, especially when the girl's body develops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the topic of shame." Scarlett covered her ears with her hands and leaned against Selma and other women to make a look. But the hand she held her ear didn't seem to work hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other older, the girl who has passed this stage is blushing and stunned. It turned out to be like this. It was scared to death and later ignorant. Understand, I understand what is going on today, and I know how to protect myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young women, big sisters are protecting the girls, holding the group of men: "Look at what, look back at your wife, mother!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting curious eyes, many men subconsciously think: "Is it necessary to follow the Arcanist's point of view, care more about the family, every month is the same ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Physical Mystery" program came to an end, and the radio sounded quite passionate: "Apollo" magic crystal light, light by yourself Master! Now open the power line to set up business, will be free of charge for six months of electricity, what hesitate? Pick up your wallet, apply for opening, buy crystal lights! City City Hall, 'Elemental Gifts' company in charge of work The branch of Holm Mining Union Bank is dedicated to serving you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the topic of "body mystery" today, the atmosphere in the lobby has eased a lot. In addition to not dare to speak loudly, everyone brought light It looks, Scarlett and other female family name is whispering into the circle together, Andy, Martin and others aside to whisper, while ambiguous smile, sometimes secretly looked at those girls, girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few advertisements, the sweet and crisp voice of the nightingale came out: "The show has already passed halfway, let us enter the 'corridor of music', linger in the beautiful melody, relax the tiredness of the day, and then we will offer you Mr. Evans' latest piano piece "Free Heart", slightly warm and light music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien music identity in the magician, aristocratic circle Exposure, the "Sound of Mystery", he proposed the "three close" principle close to the public, close to the farmer, close to the ordinary people, from the complex, rigorous structure, profound and profound theme of the symphony developed simple, sweet, romantic Short, light music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this process, Lucien himself tried to create a lot of light music works, and also copied some famous works on the earth, such as "City of the Sky", etc. There are good and general, and for the quality of the works during this period of time, people who know the identity of his great musicians understand that this is the price that transformation must pay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than three years of experimentation, Lucien’s own light music works have already reached a fairly high standard, and they are more and more popular among the citizens and romantic. Aristocratic young people loved it, and the high-end teahouses on the street began to use these music to create a relaxed, elegant, romantic and quiet environment to attract guests, and the effect was very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans' new work?" Scarlett folded her hands and pressed against her chin, looking forward and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Selma and other girls are similar expressions, other listeners, regardless of men, women and children, have closed their mouths, ready to listen quietly, the first wonderful music It always gives a deep impression. They are ordinary citizens who rarely have the chance to listen to real musicians. After they touched the sound of mystery and light music, they loved the music from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody is melodious, the notes of the piano are like clear and transparent springs, slamming in the heart, everyone seems to fall into the quiet mountain, around It is a lush green forest. It is surrounded by pure streams of water, and the sound of birds is ringing from time to time. On the contrary, it is more peaceful and quiet. The soul seems to have great comfort. Peace and tranquility are the greatest happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is invisible, but the sound of leaves and branches is reflected in it. It is free and chic, flying and flying, letting it go through life, People who have a low belief have created a thick layer of ashes on their minds, and it is difficult to obtain the feeling of spiritual freedom. As for the ashes, they cannot figure out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of freedom is gradually subsiding, and the piano music "Free Mind" is full of rhyme, and seems to reverberate in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Too, it’s so nice!" Scarlett said to her obsessively, and Selma couldn’t say anything, only nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the free mind, it is the female surname musician, Miss Louise's light music "Stream Side"." When it comes to the name Louise, the nightingale has Obvious pause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the relaxation of the music corridor, the audience fell into a state of tranquility, and everything was easy to listen to. The sound of the nightingale became sweeter: "Welcome to enter On the 'History of the First' program, we will ask the young historian Pan De to restore the unknown truth in the Twilight War and restore the inquisition of the Inquisition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I have a book written by the church myself, called "The Sorcerer's Skull", and the records inside should be true and trustworthy." Pand's voice is slightly sharp, "..." If the suspect is too concealed A lonely life, then this of course proves that he is a magician; if the suspect is often attending a banquet, warm and cheerful, then he is obviously pretending to transfer other people's doubts. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you listen, the more pale Andy’s face is, the church is terrible, it’s terrible!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and others have already heard the voice of mystery, if it is known to the church, no, as long as it is suspected...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to be careful!< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the heavy history, let us enter a relaxed rhythm, the most popular 'One Thousand and One Nights' program starts right away, still the poor boy Lee entered a series of interesting stories about the Sanchou Magic School. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poor boy can also become a magician.
