			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred calendar 823, the end of the crouching month (February), Rantart, "Sardini" district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This area was originally outside the city, and it was the ordinary merchant who sold the fish in the stormy strait. Later, it gradually gathered fish for pickling, processing, sorting, Intermediaries and other living citizens, and gradually prospered, flourished in the Kingdom of Holm due to the influence of the Magic Council, the second expansion of the city of Rentat was incorporated into the city, the "Sardini" "The squid is named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the magic steam train between the "Port of Padre" and "Lentat", the fishery is relying on abundant funds, The cheap price, the monopoly of fresh goods, the bankruptcy of ordinary businessmen, the change of the turn, and the citizens who have been born in this way have begun to work hard for big businessmen, while others have fallen into the miserable situation of unemployment. Fortunately, at this time, the initial popularity of alchemy items, the increase in alchemy workshops, so that the unemployed citizens will not find a way to live, Sadeney only used In a few years, it became a block of semi-worker and semi-fishery practitioners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark, a house can not afford magical crystal lights, still flashing dim candlelight, but the street lights on both sides of the street are in a spider web The black line is bright and dazzling, the light and shadow are shaking, and the darkness is dense and dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, dogs and men!" A 14-year-old boy looked at the men and women in the shadows behind the streetlights and spit aloud, though The Kingdom of Holm is conservative in style. Apart from whispering, the couple did not kiss and touch, but the youngsters still had their eyes shining, and they were full of envy and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andy, don't look, that's almost coming." A slight voice came from behind the street trees on both sides of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy was shocked and quickly turned around and saw that the three little friends were reaching out from a big street tree, which was out of reach. Waved to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, that..." Andy looked back, and the expression suddenly changed, showing a nervous and excited look, seeming to be doing a piece Very dangerous and exciting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallly close to the street tree, he whispered: "William, Mickey, Martin, why don't you come to me early?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin's Martin whispered: "How dare you come to you? You must be peeping at someone else's date."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. "The blonde William cleared his throat. "Spring is here, everything is breeding, and it is full of enthusiasm. Andy is in the season of estrus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Want to die?” Andy glared at them with gnashing his teeth, and his blue eyes were full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small voice! You really want to die!" Mickey's right hand palm, the shortest but deadly face, slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy took a deep breath, closed his mouth tightly, pointed to the distance, and used his eyes to signal now to leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, or else I will be late, I can't hear the voice of Miss Nightingale." William looked fascinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is also estrus..." Martin, I don't know what you look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several little friends whispered, timid and cramped, like a thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned over a dozen houses and passed through two sparse woods, their voices gradually subsided, the silence was exceptional, and the breathing became heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a row of civilian houses in the remote corner of the "Sardini" area, they walked to the third-floor ordinary two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After pulling the neckline of the clothes and covering half of the face, Andy repeatedly knocked the door six times in two fast and three slow paces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was silent and open, and a middle-aged man with a serious expression quickly looked around and used his eyes to signal Andy and they came in quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strong men in the hall, there are girls, there are old people, there are children, there are young men in the "estrus period" of Andy, and there are also a few young girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other, Andy, William and others played a short stature and squeezed in the crowd, finally reaching a few girls, 腆Smiled on the face: "Scarlett, Selma, are you here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond pretty little girl squinted at them and would be white and slender The fingers are in the mouth: "Hey, quiet, I want to start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Andy and others trembled, temporarily Without the minds of the girls, I was eager to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the house, the serious middle-aged man with a flat face wearing an old white shirt, squeezing in the middle, fiddling with the size of the skull placed on the coffee table Weird things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of this thing is gray and full of strange patterns, with a row of black buttons and two circular knobs, as long as a shofar Two long lines of sparkling metallic luster come out, about half a meter long, and are also wrapped in odd symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at serious middle-aged men playing with this weird thing, Andy and others are always young, male or female, rude or sin, all as if Waiting in the church as a week of worship, it seems that it is an unusual sacred thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizizi, the sound of the familiar current sounded, Andy’s back was straight, and the people around him made similar actions with him at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vague, hoarse female voice came out of the weird things, and as the middle-aged man fiddled, the voice gradually became clear:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello everyone, FM 592.6Hoz, here is the voice of 'Mystery', thank you for listening, now it is 10 o'clock in the evening of Allinge, the next four hours will be Your friend 'nightingale' I will spend with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet and touching female voice heard that William, Andy and others are tickle, guessing that Miss Nightingale has How beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first program is 'Life Tips', I will bring you a healthier and more reasonable lifestyle, so that everyone can avoid life. To all kinds of hazards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In recent months, Rantart and other cities in the Kingdom of Holm have seen many unscrupulous businessmen playing the 'radiation surname' Names selling toothpaste, body wash and other items, claiming to be more fashionable, better effect, can extend life, but actually?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing, we Have to talk about it five months ago, the Arcane Review Board member, the high-level Arcanist, the three Holm Crown Award, an immortal throne award, an Arcane Scepter Award, and a Snow Medal Award winner Lucien? Evans published a paper that has been sealed for three years, the paper he won the Ice and Snow Medal: "A new element that can radiate electron flow and two other types of rays." In this paper, he first proposed The concept of natural radiation surnames, thinks that some elements are unstable in structure and will emit The elements and the flow of electrons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! Selma, a lot of works in the 'Music Corridor' are his creations, our favorite ones The ministry! He still has such a long list of titles! It is also the same name as the big musician!" After more than a year of "science", Scarlett, who understands the meaning of these titles, said with amazement, the hall is depressed. The exclamation is one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy is very contradictory, on the one hand is a girl she admires, on the other side is a musician and magician she likes very much, what should I do with Lucifer? ? What about Evans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the hard-hitting natural radiation surname description, after a few months of businessman’s fatigue bombing, they can probably figure out what is going on, with those merchants’ words. Say, "This is the best toothpaste that can emit new elements and electrons. The electron flow can effectively remove the dirt on your teeth and restore them to whiteness. The new elements can make you healthy. At present, only those big nobles can often Use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On this issue, we interviewed Mr. Lucian Evans, who elaborated on the 'natural radiation surname' in While emitting new elements and electrons, these materials also emit a 'curse'. Curses will change your body, let your hair fall, your teeth loose, your blood will be distorted, your body will be exhausted, and new elements and electrons will flow. It will also cause serious damage within the scope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
