			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Sky, Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute of Atomic’s salary is very rich. Just a year later, Black has been able to rent a villa with a garden in the suburbs, but his hobby is not because When I arrived in Allinge, I changed my mind and heard the "Sound of Mystery" and "World Reality" every night before I meditated and fell asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The progress of the above parliament in the expansion of the four major cities of the Straits and the North Coastal Corridor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Lark" is crisp and pleasing to the eye. The sound of ice crystal falling onto the porcelain plate is introduced into Black's ear, and the heart that is lazy on the sofa is filled with calm joy, and the peaceful night around the villa. Melt into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, the current sounds from the magic radio, Black looked puzzled at the past, what happened? The "worldly real" program should be halfway through? Is it caused by the disorder of electromagnetic signals during this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting out of the sofa, Black walked to the front of the magic radio, extended his right hand, ready to adjust, but suddenly there was an old voice on the radio. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Speaker, it is very likely that there will be a long time for new theories or new results that are suitable for my current bottleneck, but they are also more likely to explode. Drop my head, especially Lu Xien? Evans, the headshot, the head demon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black stunned, Lord Speaker, Douglas Your Excellency? Did the "World Reality" channel invite him? It was so exciting and exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcanists who grew up in the parliament were all stunned by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who established the Parliament in a high-risk manner and laid the foundation for the development of the Arcane. His gravitational theory and movement system are classics of worship and learning by generations of magicians. It is amazing. After hundreds of years, it is one of the two pillars of the Arcane system. The Principles is also hailed as one of the most important works in the history of arcane and magic, from the darkness to the symbol of civilization that explores the mysteries of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for most arcane masters, the Speaker of the House of Lords is the spiritual pillar of the parliament, a mountain that the magic field can never circumvent, supporting the Austrian Most of the sky in the system is the object of their worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The progress he has brought is not fully demonstrated. Maybe three years, maybe five years, ten years, you can see the ones he proposed. The value of the new theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is the Speaker, whether it is the voice or the tone of speech! Brooke was so excited that he had the privilege of hearing a speech by the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the "Alishe Weekly News Review" on the "World Reality" channel. The impression was very Deep, the calm atmosphere, the kind of praise to the latecomers, is definitely not a fake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s great, finally invited directly to the Speaker of the World to the 'World Real' channel! The only question is why the voice is so ugly and so old. Come visit, not everyone's old friend 'Lark' or Miss Nightingale, just listening to their voice is a kind of enjoyment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black mind There have been some funny ideas in the flash, but he also guessed that this man is an old friend of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, so he can be invited to know that the two channels have been established for several years, and no member of the highest panel has been willing to participate. Talk to the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like "On the electrodynamics and mass equations of moving objects"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Right.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s abrupt voice was passed into Black’s ear, and the smile on his face faded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he also highly respects his boss, the director of the Institute of Atomic Research, Lucien? Mr. Evans, but for the time being concentrated in the field of new alchemy, concentrated in the field of elements, and in the theory of gravity, in the movement system, he has been a follower of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, so in the past few months, he witnessed Evans was thrilled to subvert the historical moments of the Douglas movement system, while he was lost. It seems that the spiritual pillar supporting his own arcane idea collapsed, and the arcane world that was originally clear and ambiguous became chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the one of the most classic sports systems of the Speaker of the House of Representatives is wrong. What else can't it be wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, fortunately, there is the gravitational theory that makes people admire and admire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "live room" of the "World Reality" channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lark" Samantha has always kept a good state of mind and read the press release, ready to wait for the commentary, but suddenly saw the live broadcast The door to the room was opened by someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was an accident!" The wizard's face came a little pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha is both the anchor and the manager of Lucien’s commission to deal with the “world’s real” channel, and she uses her eyes to indicate what’s going on. Let the arcane division responsible for the guardianship of the magic array insert the advertisement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane man who came in took a magic radio and was very puzzled: "Ms. Samantha, your live broadcast is interrupted, it pops up inside." The conversation between the Speaker and other magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Samantha is very aware that the program has not invited the Speaker, this has never happened. She couldn’t react at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcian turned on the radio and made everyone in the live room hear an old voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"... doubts about self-awareness, doubts about the arcane system of the past few hundred years. Lord Douglas, I followed you from the late Twilight War, step by step from the oppression of the church, the swing of the nobility The establishment of the parliament, your theory of gravity, your system of movement, is the beacon that guides me to turn my thoughts into the spirit of the arcane spirit. But now, one of the two lighthouses has suddenly been declared a 'wrong' and collapsed. I really I don't know what the letter is. I feel like the ship in the storm. It is dark in the eyes and I can no longer find the direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of the whole make the whole The arcane masters in the live room are all stunned. It seems to be a question of their own heart in the past few months. Those who have not experienced the collapse of the spiritual pillar can never understand the loss and the lack of support in these words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha of the Astral and Force Fields held their breath and waited for the answer from the Speaker, who had never commented on this issue before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not an error, but a low-speed approximation of the relativistic system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s voice live up to expectations The ground is ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the low-level Arcanists such as Black, the world’s “real channel” was honored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and most of the Arcane masters have seen it. He can clearly distinguish the voice and tone of the Lord, and it is more certain that Samantha, who has visited the "real secrets" with the teacher, is more certain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer of the Speaker of the Speaker is too general and popular? Is it Lucien? Evans's explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Speaker, the low-speed approximation is actually to show that your sports system ignores too much, there is too much error... 'Time is space, space is Time ', 'time depends on matter, is a function of speed', don't you feel completely subverting our perception?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right! It is this feeling! The Arcanists agree with them, and the Speaker of the Speaker will give a model or explanation that is more suitable for everyone to understand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really different from intuitive understanding. It is hard to imagine that when I first saw it, there was a feeling that life was completely negated in the past thousand years." Douglas is a bit old and The sound of the sound came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the arcane masters in the live room seem to have a thunderstorm, and in the past thousands of years, life has been completely negated, and life has been completely negated...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the life of your Speaker is completely negated, then what about us? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brian, you go to Lucien, I tell you that Helen is turning on the power of the magical array and shielding the electromagnetic signals of Allinge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way The plan that Sean made at the time - from the earth, he could not have imagined that the enemy could also use the radio and electromagnetic signals to reverse the magician, so several emergency plans were made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this can only block Allinge for the time being, Samantha has no time to take into account the divisions and local organizations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The real beginning of the world is beyond our imagination, more and more questions we can't answer, more and more things are pointing at the same thing, What is the nature of gravity, how did it first appear, and if your celestial movement system is established, what is the initial power to make the planet spin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Samantha touched the hand of his communication earrings and it was stiff there. This is a question that every magician of the astrology is confused. What is the nature of gravity? How will the speaker answer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habitual surname allowed her to wait while connecting Helen’s secret frequency band, and the sound whirls like a wind: “Herren Helen, the world’s real channel, the enemy’s signal Invasion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen, who is on the 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, is a snow-and-elf-like woman with a black but green lips. A strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard Samantha’s words, not busy turning on Allinge’s power to interfere with the magic array, but turned on the radio on the desk and wanted to hear How to invade and increase experience for future defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also my question, what is the source of gravity, and how it is transmitted. At the beginning, how did it occur, how to make the system of celestial movement Founded... Sometimes, I have to admit that the more you know, the more confused and fearful you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I was wrong from beginning to end. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening and listening, Helen’s delicate and cold face had an uncontrollable expression of shock and conviction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may suspect that this is a fake or magical forgery, but she is a great arcane master, and she is clearly a legendary magician, especially after the legendary peak. The cognitive world and the soul will gradually merge, and the words and phrases will bring the influence and feedback of the cognitive world to the real world. Even if there is no magic, the sound will have a unique feeling unless it is deliberately concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you can clearly understand the cognitive world of a legendary magician, it is extremely difficult to imitate and falsify this unique feeling, each capable of doing so They are the leaders in the field of illusion and transformation, such as the eyes of curses, such as the king of nightmare, such as the master of deformation, but how can they do this when the parliament has just won a big victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the six great arcans, there are two more or less Douglas students, the one who is naturally the "master of control" Brook, less This is the "ice witch" Helen? Paris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parmela’s hut is a magical organization that controlled the Northland during the period of the ancient magical empire. There were two or three legendary magicians in the heyday, and later merged. When I entered the parliament, due to the long-term unsuitability of the arcane concept, the development became very slow, and Helen’s talent was outstanding. She had unusual views on arcane research. Her teacher felt that she could not teach her a little, and she asked Douglas to help. guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Helen’s heart, Douglas is like a father, he supports the sky of the Magic Council, illuminating the path of arcane research, but now he says “Maybe "I have been wrong from beginning to end." Such a discourse, how can we not let her have a sense of world outlook, outlook on life, disillusionment of values, shocked to forget the shielding interference that is ready to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe which kind of god-forged voice..." Helen found an explanation for things in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I’m wrong from start to finish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe listened to "world truth" in his own magic tower in Heidler City. At first he thought it was the special speaker of Douglas, listening to it. He noticed that it was wrong, but the content of the exchange seemed to have a sweet and depressing charm, so that he could not control himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't work hard to get to this step, do you tell us that it was wrong from the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe holds the red wine glass and looks out the window. The whole city of Heidler is shrouded in dark gray nights, and the lights are like stars. They keep flashing, as if every single person who heard the dialogue is not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Necromancer does not prevent them from studying gravity, something that seems to contain the deepest mysteries of the world, and does not prevent them from establishing a parliament And Douglas of the Arcane system expresses respect from the heart, especially the creation of calculus. The study of geometric models makes the promotion of all factions' magicians much simpler and less dependent on medicines and materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The element will headquarters, tonight, responsible for the guardian Lavin listening "The world is real", his face is blue and tight, and he has not been able to stretch it. He did not expect that the speaker will say this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a very good relationship with the astrologer of Gaota, and he has a deep research on gravity. He understands "what is the source of gravity and how it is transmitted," In the beginning, how did it come about, how to make the system of celestial movements set up? These problems are the mystery of studying gravity to the end, and they have similar confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how can you lose your confidence and say the wrong words from beginning to end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no problem, we solve it step by step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I think about all mysteries right from the start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the gravitational system for many years is obvious to all. The success of the artificial planet is to make it deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. This is hardly development, not progress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions that involve the root cause cannot be impatient and must be built on the solid foundation of current research results! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Excellency, don’t lose your confidence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you lose confidence, you don’t know how many arcans, including legendary magicians, will be confused and even desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we should look for an explanation from the philosophical point of view, perhaps there is indeed the first impetus, there is the root of everything, in that case, the gravitational system, the celestial body Running the system, you can build it perfectly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, I can’t help thinking about it, maybe there is a supreme being. It really has the first driving force, otherwise the whole arcane system can't be explained from the source, it will be like a villa without a foundation. After a gust of wind, it will collapse and destroy directly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supremacy of existence, the first impetus, no such arcane system can not be established from the source... Your Excellency the Speaker, you will not want to tell us that we have been fighting the church and the believers of the God of truth for the rest of our lives. In the end, I discovered that all our pride and all our beliefs depend on the God of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven slammed up from the chair, his right hand trembled violently, unable to believe that this would be what Douglas’s speaker had said, and began to use the prophecy to discern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s pursuit of truth, disdain for hypocrisy** The teacher’s face also reveals oldness and weakness. He can’t believe and can’t accept that the Speaker will believe that the supremacy exists to dominate everything. The arcane system he established and the Magic Council are a joke, and they are attached to the two. It is also a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annonis, have you heard the truth of the world? It’s true or false to use astrology to confirm the words of the Speaker." Raven remembered that he was not good at prophecy. Class spells, so quickly contact friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Samantha, he heard Douglas’s question about gravitational theory and avatars During the "stone carving", an electroscientist in the "live room" hurriedly informed Lucien that this is the highest privilege he has been able to contact so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I exchanged the ring and really confirmed the relationship. Lucien had the passion to fight for her family. Suddenly, his single glasses were slightly hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans, fast, listen to the 'world' channel'..." A strange male surname sounded stunned, but in a panic Unclear, Lucien asked in a row and did not get a valid answer. He could only turn on the magic radio and tune to the "World Reality" channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, without the first driving force, your gravitational system and movement system will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first driving force, isn't that the concept of the group of theologians to show off? What is the speaker and the person discussing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the origin of the whole world? Who am I? Who is me? Where are we from? Where are we going? These questions can be learned from Arcane research. Is it explained?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not allowed for the time being, still in the realm of philosophy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean listened and listened, smelled the wrong taste, quickly broke the communication, and directly contacted the defender, Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beep, always busy, not connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is the scope of theology. As long as there is a supreme being and a first impetus, these problems can be explained."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Lucian’s bad feelings are getting stronger and stronger, no time to find Helen again, have problems, find a teacher! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Fernando was disturbed by the research and was not in a good mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, the real channel of the world was invaded, and there may be church members in the Lord of the Speakers who are here! Helen can't be contacted!" Very fast and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is real?" Fernando is an eager surname, and he returned to the Allinge Magic Tower from the semi-position and rushed to Helen’s study. He is worried about problems with Helen. As for Douglas, as a longtime friend, Fernando is more convinced of him, saying that he is still reluctant to understand the collapse of the world because of the new arcane theory, but To say that he will believe in the God of truth and go to the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呸! The truth of the gods who have just been attacked by the eternal blaze is also worthy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening Helen’s door and seeing her face sitting behind the desk whispered palely: “What is gravity, what is its essence...” Fernando snorted in his heart, what did Douglas say, and made Helen so confused? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Helen will not recognize the voice of Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Franks recognized the problem of the origin of the Arcane, so returned to the Lord's embrace, Douglas, don't deny it, your heart has begun to believe the first push Force, I believe there is a supreme being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando's entangled storm stopped, looking at the magic radio, as if looking forward to Douglas's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can't deny that I believe in the first impetus and believe in the supremacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Douglas has no emotional voice, echoing in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen slammed his eyes sharply, and a tearful tear from the corner of his eye like ice crystals filled with a sad and inexplicable emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando groaned and then sighed deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the record of Pope’s half-face conversation with the Magic Council Douglas. The greatest magician also believes in a supreme being.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle and funny male voice came out with a soothing meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zizz, the current sound reappeared, and the normal advertisement was quickly restored:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden 坷,金坷拉, farmer friends use it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound filled with joy filled the room, but the atmosphere was suppressed, and Helen’s voice was dry and dry: “I don’t think that the speaker who fights with the church for a lifetime will believe that there is a god, questioning Start your own arcane theory..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is not the name of Douglas! I absolutely don't believe that a person who is so close to the real world will believe in truth. "The god of this kind of ruin!" Fernando growled. "Helen, you go to the half-face to find Douglas and see what is going on? I am looking for Begner, let him predict the true and false of this conversation, the pope is a god. The existence of the hierarchy may be something we can't imagine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando's storm-like roar woke up Helen, yes, I haven't asked the speaker to confirm the situation. I doubt him blindly, this is not in line with the spirit of arcane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I can’t deny that I believe in the first impetus, Believe in the supremacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One slammed, a translucent statue placed on Lavin’s desk was unconsciously swept to the ground, broken into Countless small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the many fragments, Lavin is like seeing the collapse of one of the supporting pillars of the Arcane system, the sky in the arcane field is broken. A big hole that can't be made up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent and exhilarating arcane palace seems to have been burned into ruins by a fire, and the world is dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, how can the Speaker of the House think so, how can he introduce a supreme being..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler City, Felipe’s red wine glass was smashed by his own bang, and it sounded outside. This one's death spirit mourns, it seems that many undead creatures are out of control due to the master's squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horror of horror, Felipe’s pale and sick face is full of self-deprecating ridicule: “The founder, perfection, magic of arcane theory” The spiritual leader of the parliament actually declared that his or her theory of arcaneism was wrong, and declared that he believed that a god was controlling himself. If this is true, if this is confirmed, I doubt that someone will burst his head, even if No, the confidence in the advanced stage will be ruined. Maybe for a long time, no one can promote the legend, and the legendary lords are hard to upgrade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And here, maybe it includes myself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of ghosts, zombies, and mummies are so desperate and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it forged, magicians can use prophecy, Astrology identification, see if it is true or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien frowned, hurried out of the office, rushed to the sky broadcast on the lift On the thirty-first-story area where the radio station is located, you must first confirm the situation here, and then go to the teacher and you will not be able to assess the impact of this conversation on most of the arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door to the "World Reality" channel, Lucien saw Samantha whispering in his own hair: "What is gravity?" Where did the initial gravity come from..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes looked around and there was more sorrow in the ears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does that mean that there is really a god who is pushing everything at first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gravitational theory depends on the existence of the gods..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is gravity? What is its essence..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manipulator of the electromagnetic system was half-hearted and lost his life: "Don't panic, maybe this is the church's forged conversation record, and tomorrow Douglas Speaker will come forward to clarify!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, even if it is really the speaker, you have to clarify the filth and lies of the church! This is the only thought in Lucien’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, tomorrow we will interview the Speaker of the Speaker, let him clarify in person and stabilize the people." Samantha seems to wake up and refuse to believe the words. "Lusien, are you here? Is there any news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is no doubt the truth, I will go to Lord Helen and find the Speaker. "Lu Xien smashed the tunnel and made everyone's emotions smooth." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien himself came across, and if it was a god, it was not acceptable, but it must be based on the repetition of phenomena and experimental results. Reproducible, things that are not confirmed are illusory to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repressed, sad and chaotic atmosphere, Lucien quickly left the "Sky Radio" and rushed to the 33rd floor "Iceland The witch's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just arrived at the door, Lucien heard the teacher’s roar: "Begner, do you tell me it is true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your prophecy is not missed, I will immediately find Douglas to ask!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storm-like horror The momentum came, and Lucien saw the teacher completely enter the roaring state. However, at this time, Lucien refused to worry about this worry, and eagerly asked: "Teacher, the prophet, said that the conversation was true?" The Pope really went to the 'real mystery'? What about the Speaker?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando converges on anger and suppresses the voice: "Begner says this is already happening The thing, and no one tried to interfere with the trajectory of fate, so it was very smooth to predict that it was true, as for Douglas..." His gaze looked at Helen, who had become ignorant of the snowy temperament, she was worried and impatient. The land constantly tries to open the door of transmission. "The half-plane is blocked. I don't know who himself is actively shutting down, or the hands and feet of the pope..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando is less able to suppress his own whispering impulse. At this time, the other is not important. First, open Douglas's half-face and find him. As long as he does not really invest in the truth, then everything is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, Fernando has a lot of confidence with years of understanding, so there is no confusion and confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Lucien felt that he had subverted his own cognition. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has always been a wise and generous elder in his heart. How could he suddenly Discard your own arcane ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking electricity, Lu Xi’s mind screamed two thoughts: “Teacher, predict again, maybe this is only part of the truth, sometimes, Part of the truth will be very different from true imagination!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tell the truth, just to tell the truth, to say the whole truth, this is the news that is trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covering part of the truth and distorting the facts is a technique that many people on the planet are used to playing with. Lucien is familiar, so I thought of it the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, but if Douglas does not personally clarify, many people will still doubt." Fernando contacted Douglas again, did not notice that Lucien quietly Exited the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge is like a huge monster quietly entrenched At high altitude, and far away from him, a black figure smiles and looks at it. If it is too long, it will be heard by the observing archer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Pope, I seem to have heard that Allinge is filled with the desperate and fascinating taste after the collapse of confidence." The speaker is a tall, The old man with white hair is suddenly the "heart of time" Ketonia. He uses his special ability to feel the reaction of the general archer of Aringe and Rentat. "Your strategy is really good, maybe not The war can make the Magic Council stagnate. I am afraid that it will be difficult to renew the spirit of the past in a long time. This is a great blow to their beliefs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, Douglas is too arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this effect seems to be good, maybe there are several legends in the cognitive world based on gravitational theory. The magician burst his head." Ketonia laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict III did not smugly smile: "The legendary magician is not so stupid, and he will not blindly believe in Douglas before using it, that is, using language to induce The way they let them only recognize the authenticity of the conversation rather than whether it is concealed, they will also keep the last waking, and at most lose confidence in the arcane system, and it will be very difficult to promote from then on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But two days later Douglas will come out and will not distort the situation." Ketonia also thought about waiting for Allinge to become confused and sneak in to do some damage. Killing the Magic Council has the potential to be a genius, such as Lucien? Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben’s three peacefully laughed and said: “I said that the people’s heart is very strange. After two days, he came out to clarify, most of the arcists’ doubts. I am afraid that I have already penetrated the bone marrow. I will only question whether he is so late to defend, he will not believe his remarks, and use the reasons for interpretation as a cover-up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope, It seems that you are also good at grasping the hearts of the people." Ketonia complimented a small sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III smiled: "This is also their destiny. Douglas’s suspicion of gravity and the tendency to be supreme will not be caused before the discovery of the planet. The big influence, but the artificial planet plan proposed by Lucien Evans makes the gravitational force completely believed by the Arcans. Hehe, he may be really an early morning angel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black doesn’t know when he’s soft on the couch, his voice in his ears keeps screaming, his eyes wide open, his expression stunned. How can the Speaker of the House be like this? What happened to the arcane system? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he only thought of a person, the man who frequently subverted the past knowledge, the man who had just modified the operating system, he heard the speaker The words? What kind of answer will he make? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, Fernando’s loud voice screamed eagerly: “Is there really a hidden part?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You can't predict it for the time being? What do you want your prophet to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also knows that this is Too demanding Begner, after all, is the god-level pope, but eager to see, his temper has always been so violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the use of hiding? Your questioning of gravity is not a false one...there are no answers to those questions..." Helen is still trying to open The real secret," after hearing Fernando's words, the voice is somewhat fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando resisted her impulse to roar her, walked to her side to help her, and suddenly looked around in confusion: "Lou Xi's kid?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned to the office of the Institute of Atomic Research, thinking of Lord Helen’s Confusion, I thought of the "Urban Radio" many arcane masters sighed with gravitational questions, sighed, and published a little bit of accumulation in the soul library in recent years, which will develop Evans geometry and thus The drafts of the tensor analysis coming out were printed out and sorted together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle between the legends, I can't get in the hands, but in the field of arcane, I can still make some contributions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the pen, Lu Xien closed his eyes and passed all his research on the general theory of relativity, the deduction and the unsealing of the seal in the soul library in recent years. Once again, the things in my mind gradually formed, so the feather pen fell and wrote the title: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relativistic interpretation of gravitation and geometrical descriptions and more general reference systems The theory of relativity under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, suddenly there is lightning and thunder near Allinge, heavy rain like a note! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia looked into the distance and looked at the change of the sky around Aringe, slightly and stunned: "There is a legendary magician Has the world been shaken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
