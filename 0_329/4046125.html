			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the town of Bonn, Lilith and Sarah, who can’t sleep and can’t sleep, stand in the window and look at the empty and quiet streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, I heard that from the dark ages, every other time, there will be someone missing in the town of Bonn, will it be locked? Why? Lilith asked curiously. From the information she had heard, the missing people appeared for a maximum of one hundred years, and the shortest was for several years, which made the town a strange one. The color, and the church priest came over to check but found nothing, only suspected that the beasts and monsters in the mountains secretly went down to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah smiled and shook his head: "I don't know. Even what is the lock is not clear, how to judge? But I think it should be a little related, you see that building The uninhabited house was originally one of the few noble gentlemen who belonged to a few letters in the town of Bonn, but his seven-year-old daughter disappeared on the evening of April 10th ten years ago and never found it again, so he and His wife chose to stay away from this place that made them sad and moved to the east of the country." He pointed to a house on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a coincidence that April 10th," Lilith replied thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............As if the little girl who ran out of the black and white photo had a bright smile, her arms opened and she rushed toward Lucien, waiting at the door of the house. The father’s returning daughter was as innocent and enthusiastic, but her floating body, empty eyes and no emotions made Lu Xien shudder, how dare she let her into her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hard-hitting spell was pronounced, but it could not be heard including Lucien, only to confirm that the magic was successfully displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air around the little girl began to turmoil, forming an invisible rope that rooted her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice-level magic "binding"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien undoubtedly determined that she is a ghost creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright smile disappeared immediately, a small face twisted, full of grievances and guilt, she raised her head slightly, opened her mouth, and made a silent scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "silence barrier" formed a transparent barrier that appeared in front of Lucien, and a tiny invisible ripple made it violently shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After performing the "binding" technique, Lucien is preparing this magic. This is from the understanding of the way of attacking the grievances. Knowledge is The power of the magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "silence barrier" just appeared, and it completely collapsed under the ripples that seemed to be extremely slow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream of the Wraith was neutralized by a small part and directly hit Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twirls, dizziness, "tinnitus", nausea and vomiting, Lucien's feet are like stepping on cotton, they can't keep balance, even the internal organs There seems to be signs of resonance, and countless negative emotions have emerged at the same time. Frightening, fear, resentment, etc. almost made it impossible for Lucien to stay awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s exposed skin is a subtle “gray” white light that quickly becomes blurred and then slowly stabilizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timely "moonlighting" allowed Lucien to avoid the visceral rupture, mental disorders, and even the end of death, but the moonlight does not weaken the "sorrowful scream" The attack only made the vulnerable internal organs and brains improve. Therefore, Lucien suffered a minor injury on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a grievance with the strength of a formal knight!" Lucien judged the strength and category of the "Little Girl" from this wave of attacks, right A glimpse of the foot, turned into a faint ray of shadows around the other side of this horrible grievance, and then silent spells read, "lighting" flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the weaker spirits are not afraid of most elemental damage, immune to a lot of magic, only the light (positive energy), flame, sound waves, etc. can hurt them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the bright light group would have become pale in this strangely locked world, and then it was dyed with a touch of ashes, no light at all. Feeling produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien was in the stage of casting buffers, and he could only be turned into a gray-white afterimage, and the "vigilant" sword slashed back to the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword penetrated the body of the "Little Girl" without any hindrance, but did not cause any harm to "She"! Even if it is an enchanted sword, even if it has the equivalent of a normal ordinary knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No injury to himself, the little girl’s attack on the sword and Lucien had no anger, and the distorted expression on her face recovered and she smiled again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her body disappeared transparently in the same place, and suddenly appeared in front of Lucien after a few seconds, still with the look of her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien's agility and balance are very good, and there is still room for it, the foot immediately changed direction, and began to prepare "Homerz's cough ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of white dust gathered, the little girl once again appeared in front of Lucien, and then the "silent roar" sounded and the street flew up. A group of dust, the girl's body also fluctuated with shocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of grievance and resentment appeared on the face of the little girl at the same time, and then completely turned into a grievance, first screaming silently, then rushing to Lucien without stopping. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s exhibition “Homerz’s cough” immediately changed direction, and successfully escaped the most fierce front of “sorrowful scream”. And fast moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Lucien was attacked by a wide range of "sorrowful screams", once again, his feet were soft and dizzy, and the semi-lighted body was like a wave of water. Rippling, the place paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, "Little Girl" rushed to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien’s mind became blurred and abstractly felt that his body temperature, strength, strength and vitality were rapidly disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl directly penetrated the body of Lucien and flew to the other side, she looked at herself a little unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Ice and Snow Vengeance" ring worn by Lucien played a role, quickly restored lucidity and concentration, and then did not hesitate to read the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind blew through, and there was a vague grievance between the two "people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not let the control of the low-order undead creatures summoned to concentrate on the experiment, driving it to the "little girl." If my own response is just outside the lock, there is no problem, it will never fall to the point of being seriously injured now, but it is too weird, it seems very suitable for undead, extremely weakening the magic of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien, who learned the lessons of “landy”, began to use undead to deal with undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two grievances are entangled together, the arms are stirring in each other's body, but the way Lucine greets is only quickly lightening and transparent, looks It will disappear in ten seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not in a hurry to escape, because this grievance seems to be able to blend into the surrounding air and move fast. After easing the previous magical fluctuations, Lucien once again sprinkled the casting material and mourned the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no sound in this quiet and deserted world, and a pale white flame wall suddenly wraps both grievances together, and the strong sulphur smells Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has not studied in vain for a few months, and based on deep analysis and simulation experiments, it will finally change the aura of the water ghost. It became a "sulphur fire wall" that can be used normally. The only problem is that the structure is not yet streamlined, and it takes more time and effort than other apprentice-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pale white flame, the grievances summoned by Lucien disappeared faster, and the little girl finally showed a painful expression, and her body gradually faded, but The flame can't cause serious damage to her, because it is an apprentice's magic, and she is not the undead creature of the water ghost who is physically and completely restrained by the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
