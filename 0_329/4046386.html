			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a "big musician" who has seen the prayers of the truth, and Lucian on the altar quickly understands that these dwarfs are themselves When they became their "steam god", "the master of life and death" worship, the attitude of piety, can be compared to the mad believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the night plateau, once occupied by dwarves, and later conquered by vampires."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It should be that the descendants of the dwarven civilization of the steam civilization have not been destroyed, and they have been taken up by the vampires as 'bovine and sheep', miners, and blacksmiths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are probably The dwarf escaper discovered the remains of this ancestor by chance. As a result, the space transmission array was used as an altar, and the incomplete information of the dwarves in the end of the steam civilization tried to 'learn' the magic as a 'call to the gods manual'. I was sent in a ceremony to worship the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vampires seem to be annihilating them, and I use the 'elemental order' After the death of 'not dead,' they believe that I am the so-called 'the god of steam', 'the master of life and death'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain is running fast , Lu Xien did not take long, based on prayers, on-site situation, previous encounters, weeks Murals sort out about the circumstances surrounding what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Use magic to let them forget this memory so that they are not caught by the vampire and expose this node?" Lucien's first reaction was confidentiality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the eyes turned, Lucien saw the iron stove, the steam giant hammer and other items in the two rows of rooms, and suddenly the heart suddenly moved: "They still have basic The common knowledge of steam civilization? Can you carry out more complicated smelting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to simplify and want to popularize alchemy items, there is no shortage of gears that can be cast. Skilled 'worker'? If a large number of dwarves join and 'pass the band', the initial problem will be solved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the long-term monopoly of magicians Articles, the parliament is reluctant to let the hard-working apprentices engage in similar physical labor. In addition to the ordinary blacksmiths, there are not many ordinary people who can join the alchemy workshop. This problem has been plagued by Lucien, who wants to popularize alchemy items—not only can he gain huge amounts of wealth, but it can also shake the church's belief base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a need for several generations of training and edification to build a relatively large-scale "working class", but the appearance of the descendants of the steam civilization dwarf made Lucien see The dawn of a preliminary solution to the problem within a generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of omnipotent steam, may your best name spread throughout the world!" The pious prayers of the dwarves floated into the ear of Wayne and let him Quickly have a plan, "Let them use the name of the gods to make them work for the magic parliament, so as to ensure their loyalty to the greatest extent, they will not save and escape to the dwarf kingdom, reveal the core materials of the alchemy items, and have the instructions of the gods to let them It is also much easier to sign a magic contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the help of life and the magic contract have basically solved the problem, after all, most of the dwarves are becoming vampire food, slaves. Between the "new age industrial workers", they will certainly not hesitate to choose the latter and sign a strict but at least not desperate contract, but since there is a better way to add another insurance, Lucien will not refuse. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have tasks to complete, this space node is not able to send people out on a large scale. It is easy to be discovered by the vampire prince when starting frequently. Let them continue to 'latently' in the night plateau and develop more families, and the number is still too small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien decided to wait for his task to complete Then, ask the parliament to apply for the "gate of the outer world". When the time comes, the surname will take away the dwarfs who are willing to follow, to avoid a war with the vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Magic Council suddenly fights against the vampires and competes for the night plateau, it must be the Southern Church that dreams of laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the dwarf casualties caused by this, Lu Xien, although he has a guilty conscience, can still make a decisive decision, how can he not pay the price of blood? Want to get "liberated"? This kind of thing is not a treat for dinner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-ring magic "Advanced Invisibility" will not be lifted during the attack, so the transparent Lucien takes out a tube like a crystal from the storage bag. The liquid and gently pull out the stopper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ ecstasy, gratitude, excitement, let the dwarves keep praying, repeat prayers, as if a happy new life is about to unfold, how wonderful is life without the vampire cruel enslavement and killing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Harold felt that his cool breeze had become slightly hot, so he opened his eyes and was surprised to see the gray stone bricks in the underground palace in front of him. It became a yellow hot sand. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Go, go deep in the desert looking for my country." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Go, There is everything you want to get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grand, ethereal, sacred voice came from the ethereal sky, letting Harold and other dwarves turn their heads low again Buried, close to the scorching sand: "Respect your holy name, practice your will, our supreme Lord, you dominate everything in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a long time, no sound came, the elders carefully raised their heads with humility, and saw that the underground palace has become a vast desert of the Yellow Sands, and there is a hidden oasis in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the power of the gods?" The same question was once again sent out from the dwarf population, but this time it was full of awe and admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot wind blows the face, the dwarfs stand in the same place, and are shocked by the desert landscape that they have never seen but heard, and they are rolling in the endless Sha Zhen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the sun? Is this the day?" Harold looked at the burning flame in the sky and muttered to himself, awakening the elders and other dwarves. Yes, this is a place completely different from the night plateau! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the dwarf girl Mirna wondered and confused: "Great elders, where should we go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" The elders stunned and soon thought of the god of the steam god. "Let's go to the depths of the desert! Go to the Lord's heavenly kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the elders full of emotions and excitement, Harold is excited: "Great elders, where can we get the complete inheritance of the steam civilization? I want to create a description of you The city of steam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, great elders, I also like Harold, want to see the black chimney like a forest, want to see To the airship that can fly freely like a bird by simply relying on the power of steam, want to see the horrible giant ship cannon." Quinkins was so excited that he shivered, this is the dwarf rebellion that they were incompletely passed down by chance. The highest dream of the army, the giant steam city that symbolizes glory and glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sturdy and sullen Mirna, looked at other dwarfs with red eyes and beard shaking, the elders shouted: br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "great life and death dominate tell us where we can get everything!" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "Going deep into the desert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam first! Going deep into the desert!" The rest of the dwarfs answered in unison, majestic and mighty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............There is no concrete road, no clear instructions, but the dwarves seem to be able to faintly feel that something is calling themselves in the distance. So no one lost his way and walked hard in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, dry and hot sunshine, the wind blowing the yellow sand, let the healthy dwarfs gradually understand the horror of the desert, one by one Dry, one by one dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Milna, is it okay?" Harold saw the dwarf girl around him crumbling and quickly helped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirna gritted his head and shook his head: "I am fine. This is the test of the Lord. I will persevere and reach the land of heaven on the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong words make other dwarves who start to feel difficult again straight up, yeah, this is the test of the Lord, if even this suffering can not be supported, why get steam God's care? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the voice of the great elders is in the ears: "Look, look at it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It is there! It is the place where the gods indicate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most desperate and thirsty time to find "clear spring", the dwarves broke out all the enthusiasm, quickly Approaching the vague giant city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the distance is getting shorter and shorter, the city is getting clearer and clearer, and the sky suddenly sounds a huge roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves raised their heads and saw a horrible giant bird flying from the other side of the sky and heading towards the giant city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the weird giant birds flew over their heads, the roaring sounds became more and more harsh, and their ears creaked, and they saw the strange The true face of the bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a bird, but a mechanical creation wrapped in a silver-white metal casing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's so huge that it seems to be able to swallow all the dwarves present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strange bird" is flying lower and lower, flying more slowly, and gradually disappearing near the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder, this, is this an airship?" Harold asked in a shock, how was it different from the mural? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders shook their heads blankly: "Not an airship, the airship is not so fast, but it must have been made!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?" All the dwarves seem to be asking themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Elder bites his teeth: "It’s clear when you get to the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the dwarves continue On the road, silence is over them, and I don’t know what I will see when I am close to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance seemed to be much shorter than they thought. After ten minutes, they arrived at the edge of the oasis and saw the appearance of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of loud inhalation sounds from the dwarf team, this is a city beyond their imagination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of the city, they are "familiar" and "longing" to the towering tall chimneys and strangely shaped factories, while others in the city In some places, there are towers that are taller than chimneys. Even the most exaggerated steam civilization legends have not seen such high houses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These dense buildings are covered with brightly colored wall tiles of different colors, black, gray, silver, brown, and from top to bottom. Neatly arranged a transparent window that reflects the sun and brings out a dreamy taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between high-rise buildings and factories, it is a wide road, and even a bridge of land is set up like a water bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bridge, on the road, running a strange car made of steel one after another, they are smooth and full of beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fuzzy figures on the edge of the city, holding metal objects shaped like steam rifles, but smaller and lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold didn’t know that his gaze was so sharp, he clearly saw the slowly moving elevator in the building and saw countless fuzzy figures holding Strange mechanics, talking to companions in another building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirna also saw those fascinating figures holding slab-shaped metal objects, and with a single click, there were various scenes, and there were distant places. The desert, there is also a high altitude view, as if there is another world inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the night falls, and the lights in the city are lit up, and soon they become bright and shining, as far as they are, just like falling into The "Xinghe" of the earth's surface is a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unimaginable smashing city scene makes the dwarves stunned and can't say a word for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the ground on the edge of the city cracked a gap, and a "root" giant "metal arrow" sprayed a flame at a distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
