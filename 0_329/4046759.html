			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jingle, the magic steam train ran fast on the rails, the picturesque scenery on both sides regressed, let the first time the elf girl in this kind of transportation Daniel couldn't see it. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! The whistle sounded suddenly and the magic steam train stopped slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?" Although the Elf Girl Nodaniel was on the magic steam train for the first time, she was a girl who liked to listen to the Voice of Mystery. The operation of the steam train has a general understanding, knowing that non-stop parking often means a situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayerstin has been to the Magic Council several times, and suddenly noticed an abnormality, so he showed himself a natural magical "Eagle Eye", looking towards The edge of the forest in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the narrow strip between the forest and the railroad tracks, a group of wild animals are desperately attacking the opposite human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These humans have hundreds of wearing silver-gray locks, with a strong helmet, standing in three rows, holding a black "metal long stick". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the animals that launched the attack were originally very ordinary creatures, including tigers, jackals, rabbits and goats, but now they are covered with blood red Scales, gaps between the scales flow with yellowish pus, red eyes, full of killing and bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Demonization? Is there a high-level demon sneak out from Stroop Forest?" Ellerstin was slightly stunned, for her, such a The scene is too familiar, because the animals in Stroop Forest have changed similarly when the gap in the abyss changed recently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordaniel also blessed himself with "Eagle Eye", thoughtfully: "When the abyss gap suddenly expands, the elders are busy dealing with bloody kings." And the demon of the devil, the other demons rely on the adventurers in the towns of the tribes and the unnamed, and it is normal to miss them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These demonized animals It is very dangerous, how can the Holm kingdom only send the soldiers to the level of the soldiers to deal with?" Elstin will be the guard and seal Strupp forest as the responsibility of the elves, so after seeing this situation, the heart is quite Some self-blame, there would have been no similar things at all, who knows that Lord Lanhill was blinded by greed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up and pushed the windows of the VIP car and flew over to help the human soldiers deal with the demonic animals with natural magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! After a series of sounds, the mighty bloodthirsty animals seemed to have been smashed by the invisible giant hammer, and they fell to the ground and the blood was overflowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Ellerstin really noticed that these human soldiers had almost identical "black metal sticks" in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nordaniel looked at it and suddenly thought of something: "This is very similar to the high-pressure steam rifle of the dwarf steam civilization!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf's steam civilization is a lost civilization, but the elf life is long, from the mythological era to the present, the collection of various literatures is very rich, and also has a deep understanding of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no high-pressure steam backpack...no smoke...the same is the high-speed projectile to damage the enemy, which can rival the attack of the official knight..." Ellerd Give yourself a different "television class" natural magic, and carefully distinguish the difference between this weapon and the high-pressure steam rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! The human soldiers were divided into three rows, two rows of squats, a row of uprights, taking turns to shoot, and from time to time to pull out the brass-colored projectiles from their pockets into their "rifles." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the feedback of natural magic, Ellerd found that these bullets were engraved with a simple magical pattern, which exudes a touch of alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰砰砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the demonized animals are very fast and close to the official knights, they have only the opposite enemy in their red eyes, just want to tear each other into pieces, and swallow them. The direction of action is easy to lock, plus the wide range of firing shots, hiding a hair, can not hide a row, so, not long after, their number is drastically reduced, the ground is covered with dead bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elf girl Nodaniel shook her head: "What can be used? In the case of high-level professionals, they are the objects of being defensive and rebellious, like the original steam civilization, and encountering remote attack means. The lower-level magicians and knights will also suffer heavy losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High-order is also promoted from the low-end." Ellerstin looked into the distance Fighting lanes, "If weapons and armor can be mass produced, like the popular alchemy items, at least in the battles below the high level, the Holm Kingdom and the Magic Council will have a big advantage."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, a Knights had more than 500 knights, and a kingdom had a maximum of three to four such knights. The attendants could not play a role, but now, if weapons And the armor can be popularized. For the kingdom, it means adding more knights - the number of knights is sparse, but the knights have a lot of attendants, and more ordinary people can become waiters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin continued: "And who knows if the Magic Council has developed more powerful and more precise weapons for the lower-middle knights to use? Weapons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there are similar weapons with a longer range, like our excellent magic longbow, and with anti-predictive arrangements, Isn't it possible to hide in the distance and slam the head of a magician who has no triggering or passive spells?" Nordaniel listened to the "Mystery Voice" and had a special feeling of exploding his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the train conductor responsible for receiving them, an intermediate magician came in and intended to explain why they suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard their conversation and smiled: "When the weapon is developed, the defensive magic against it must have been created long ago, and At that time, magic such as spell triggering has become a mid-level spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is full of the confidence of the parliamentary mage in recent decades. For the big Arcanists, the highest judges, the high-level Arcanists, the overall upward atmosphere of the Magic Council, and confidence in the development of the Arcane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe in the research capacity of the parliament." Ellerd expressed goodwill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodaniel asked curiously: "I heard that after the introduction of the observer effect by Evans, the parliament’s research on the micro-domain has been plagued?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sound of Mystery" In order to satisfy the curiosity of ordinary people, a program similar to "Arcane and Magic Guide" was added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor is slightly awkward: "It’s just a dispute over why the microscopic particles show such a strange surname. People are convinced by the answer, but it does not mean that the micro-domain research has come to a standstill. For example, the storm dominates the Lord, the elemental dominator, and the atomic control of your in-depth study of the fission response is likely to give us a better source of energy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fission, this pollution seems to be very serious..." Ellersett frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle in the distance suddenly changed, and a goat jumped out of the few remaining animals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its shape changes rapidly, and there is a pair of bat-like wings behind it, which is a devil close to high-order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin’s face became serious, and there was a powerful demon sneak out of Stroop Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was going to the rescue, suddenly there was a silver-and-white snake-like glow that was so bright that it was like an explosion of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the flashlight, the air seems to be arranged, the demon has no chance to dodge, the upper half of the body will lean back, the burst of the crack Come, the flesh and blood corpse will fall black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Ellerstin saw a knight wearing a silver-grey full-armor armor on the edge of the forest. He was blond, handsome and determined. Carrying a silver-white "rifle" with complex shapes and smooth lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train conductor looked at this scene and took a breath: "It is the Gauss rifle developed by Lord Evans, only close to the day knights and high-ranking magicians. Can only be used, because there is no mass production, there are only three, he seems to be the John Knight of the Knights of Truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
