			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-gray long sword swayed slightly, and the Rhine suddenly flashed to the gate that had not yet been closed, leaving only the phantom that slowly disappeared, funny and curious. "Do you also meet the monster that can really disguise others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a little relaxation in his tone, it seems to confirm that Lucien is Really. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien watched him with vigilance, and after re-holding the mechanized mind and mind barrier, he was still rational and calm, and did not really attack directly: "Mr. Rhein How do I make sure that you are real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least you have to come up with irrefutable facts, otherwise everyone will go better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine pulled the door, did not close it, smiled and said: "I understand that breath, blood, **, memory, etc. can not tell whether it is a monster camouflage, I was injured before, but one thing, I believe that unless the monster is the god of truth, there is absolutely no way to simulate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Sean vaguely guessed the answer of Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of huge bat wings emerged behind the Rhine Red Jacket, a faint silvery moonlight illuminates, and the condescending, supernatural thing is coming, so that there is a gray hall The silver moon rises: "That is the ancestor's breath, the monsters certainly can't disguise the gods, and the breath of your left hand makes me understand that you are not fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the familiar Atena's breath, Lucien gently vomited and revealed the mysterious presence of the silver moon and the dead spirit left in the left hand without any reservation: "Okay, I believe You are Mr. Rhein. If the monster can simulate the breath of the gods, then I can't escape without being deceived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein coughed twice, mouth corner There is blood overflowing. For vampires, vomiting blood is a very serious injury, but he smiles indifferently: "Cautious is a normal choice, I am just a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster I met was disguised as you, what did you encounter? "Lucien put away the sword of truth, but did not put down the shield of truth, he has maintained a watchful attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine once again coughed twice: "It disguised as another kin, the kin, who had a good relationship with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems that monsters can not only pretend to enter the life of the 'gray maze', but also simulate other strong." Lucien said in confusion, what is this based on? principle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray labyrinth is the name of Lucien's grey hall with a black door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray labyrinth? Hehe, here is called the 'world of the door', at least the legendary magicians who have been missing here are so called." Rhein corrected Lucien Named, "I suspect that the world of this door is weird, maybe our memory can't be kept secret, so the monster disguised him according to my memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory cannot be kept secret, then Do you have a secret from the earth? What about the soul library? Lucien frowned and thought about this serious question. Wait a minute to see the monsters simulating Yuan Shi Tian Zun, Tai Shang Lao Jun, Gundam, Super Saiyan, Star Warship, and Retreating Cannon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a wonderful world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The World of Doors? Mr. Rhein You Found What did Viken have left behind?” The Soul Library had no way to discuss with the Rhine, and Lucian turned to another key point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shook his head: "I traced the mysterious fragments of Sarde's body and came here. Only a few pieces of shredded paper were found before the attack. There are some records on it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hide, took out a few gray papers and "flyed" to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully grabbed by the hands of the clerk, Lucien hurriedly browsed through:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...... There are countless black gates here, and each door may be pleasantly surprised or dangerous. We named it the world of the door..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"...maybe we can find ways to get there by studying these creatures..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It seems like someone has come in here..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handwriting on two sheets of paper, Lucien is familiar, one is MacLeod’s just seen, and the other is the prophet Maskilin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange creatures, are there a lot of monsters?" Lucien said numbly, secretly rubbing the contents of the last piece of shredded paper. Has anyone ever come in? Before Maskillin them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine closed the black door, took out a white handkerchief, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and shook his head: "Impossible, if there are many monsters, Muskilllin They have the opportunity to discover them, and they can take notes so easily.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meant that Maskillin should have just come in and not long before they Exhausted, after all, their strength is not comparable to the one who can summon the silver moon, and the number is large, it is very easy to give a chance to camouflage monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, even Mr. Rhein you have been seriously injured by sneak attack." Lucien nodded gently. "Right, Mr. Rhein, the monster you met. What is the strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine folding handkerchief, put it into the jacket pocket: "The legendary peak, the true legendary peak, I summoned the power of the ancestor Fight it back, but if it wasn’t for me, I couldn’t beat it, but I couldn’t escape it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a moment, he smiled, humor Authentic: "I am a legendary third-order man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I meet only the legendary second-order?" Lucien is quite confused about this. “Don't we meet different monsters?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If it’s a different monster, why is it just one step higher than our own strength?” Rhein was acutely aware Doubtful, "Beyond the ability to summon the ancestor, I am the legendary third-order, and without the equipment upgrade, you should be only the legendary first-order Level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not clear about the time comparison with the outside world, so I am not sure about the "monster" that Lucien is unimaginable at the advanced speed. Has it been promoted to the second-order legend? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has that strange familiarity, this situation seems to have been encountered, but how can not find qualified encounters, Can only ponder: "Yes. Perhaps because of any special restrictions, the monster can only play the first-order strength higher than the target?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is possible." Rhine smiled consistently, as if encouraging Lucian to guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly raised an idea and smiled at the Rhine: "Mr. Rhein, if this inference is true, you said that we both acted together and met Will it be a monster or two monsters, is the second-order strength of the legend, or the strength of the legendary peak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be a legendary peak Monster." Rhein thought for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien "coldly" don't open his face: "Then let's go separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Sorry, I will always be on the same road with you." Rhein also replied humorously. "And an experienced, secret-observing observer is very useful here. Besides, it is just speculation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy smiled and said: "I am also worried that I will encounter the legendary monster when I act alone, so there is still Mr. Rhein, your back is better, I think There should be no monsters of the kind, well, Mr. Rhein, I am not going to continue exploring, and I am going to return. There is no distance between the entrance and the entrance. It is just a dozen black doors. Do you want to be together?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was seriously injured, obviously not suitable for staying." Rhein pulled out a light green puppet arm. "Fortunately, you meet the guy who knows the law of coordinate changes, otherwise I I don’t know when to explore, this is a paid advance, McLeod’s independence. The method of making a avatar doll component, parsing it can make you gain a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observing the environment, summarizing the law, is the magician's strength, and the magician The Arcans are especially good at, and Rhein himself is very self-aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
