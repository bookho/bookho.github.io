			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight is cold and fascinating. After penetrating the curtains, it becomes extremely weak. Not only does it fail to eliminate the darkness in the room of Lucien, but it brings inexplicable gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of different shades changes with the change of light. At first glance, it seems to have a life-like squirm, you can look carefully, it is so depressed. So quiet, it seems to be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this darkness, Lucien lying on the bed gave a gentle and long breath, making the atmosphere of the whole room more peaceful and soft, giving people a good The dream of a dream is happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the feedback of the dark, he did lie in bed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two long The swords are placed on both sides of the bed, ten centimeters away from the hand, very alert..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The breathing is normal, the heartbeat is normal, the mental fluctuations are normal, just the hands are covered by the body or the quilt Squeeze, it is difficult to check it carefully... The sleeping position is really ugly, there is no such thing as aristocratic elegance... but it’s good, it will slow down and he will pick up the enchanted sword for about a second. This may be his life. One second with death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleeping heavily, perhaps the knight and the big knight in the vine patrol guard gave him a sense of security... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The talisman is still worn on the chest. According to the intelligence, it is very fast, but the anti-death enchantment is only for the dead, cursed magic, neither can defend Physical and elemental attacks, etc., can't hurt the attacker..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And not a premium item, can't The trigger, this magical talisman and other magical items that may exist on Peter, can't work before I am in the middle of it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds The ninety-nineth grasp was sent to hell before he woke up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After careful observation, Petrov had a preliminary judgment and decided determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calmness and darkness of Lucien’s bed suddenly popped up with a figure, and he seemed to be separated directly from the darkness, without any warning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is a step across the line, dragging out the afterimage, holding a dwarf with a green light and a thick liquid in the right hand, slamming to Lucy Grace's throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Petrov didn’t dare to be too close, he didn’t dare to make any killings, he was worried about the dangerous instinct that led to Lucien’s, and made things change badly. . Although even if there are three or four magic swords in the road, there are four or five magical items, and Petrov is not afraid. The powerful ability of the dark blood can make him use the power of the magic, and then It is easy to slaughter the lamb in front of him, but the only problem is that if there is five levels of magical power, it is very likely to break the magic of Matvey's cover and let the big knights in the castle detect it, so that things will become quite trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of horror made Petrov close to Lucien in an instant, and the short blade swung by his right hand fell just right at this moment, without a slight deviation Lying on the side of Lucien's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the short sword squats in the middle of the neck, Petrov suddenly feels the volatility of a sable, it is so familiar, in this way The occasion is so horrified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrov suddenly saw Lucien under the short sword as a mirror-like smashing crack into a myriad of pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Ring Magic "Mirroring"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the dark blood is immune below its level of magic, it only refers to defense, and its attack will also be partially disturbed by some magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying "mirror" fragments are so sparkling in the dark that Peter Petrof has a dreamy beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorcerer?! Not good!" After Petrov’s sword was mirrored, he quickly returned to understand that his intelligence was wrong and everything was judged. The premise of the error! So his body quickly blurred and blackened, and he did not hesitate to retire backwards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s just a short moment of error, let him slow down a bit, and see Luisen’s chest with a half-bed separated from the mirror. The sacred and solemn light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this incandescent light, the black figure is highlighted, as if it is stunned by the light of the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-level magic "burning radiance"! Range attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petrov resisted the pain, did not scream, and struggled to avoid it, but he was shrouded in a radiant glow, as if he was trapped in a mire, The burden of a few thousand pounds moved very slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no hesitation, Petrov inspired the magic ring worn on the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the magic ring has a light black ray that just blooms, and the movement of Lucien standing on the bed is directly an "elemental order"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噼里啪啦,轰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic ring first makes a broken sound, then the magical power in the fire is destabilized, dull but horrible, and will not complete the darkening of Petrolo The husband was completely wrapped and fried his light brown blood splashing around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the excellent mental strength of Lucien’s current three-ring magician, the “Elemental Order” can be destroyed without the protection of energy and force fields. Most of the alchemy items of the fourth grade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But every time such damage, Lucian is quite distressed, which means that another possible trophy is so ruined, no wonder the Nine Rings The cracking technique has the title of "the enemy and the enemy cry", because once it is used, the magic items and magical items below the legend are almost completely destroyed. Even if the enemy is killed, there is nothing to gain, but also look at that one. An unusually precious and shredded item was annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is a range of magic regardless of the enemy, if you still stand with your teammates... So Lucien’s "Elemental Order" must have " Conscience is much more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Petrov’s efforts to make dark changes in the explosion, Lucian did not give him a chance, and the talisman’s talisman’s talisman was once again soft and sacred. A flame that seemed to descend from the sky hit Strath directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the dark blood is the most taboo and the most powerful ability "dark assimilation" Petrov just took the most out of the "glow glow" But only desperately see that the flame of the flames is like a heavenly punishment, completely covering yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flame of "flame", the dark body of Petrov quickly melted away and quickly vanished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! His unwilling emotions are so strong that it seems to reverberate in the room with silent screams! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of the power of Peterlov’s dark blood has not yet been revealed, such as "black corrosion", "dark assimilation" and other spells, what speed and strength in the dark , agility, balance, will and other comprehensive improvement, what immunization of many supernatural effects, immune level below magic and magic, all have not yet revealed the room, he fell into a series of deliberate, only a few seconds of magic with magic Attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does this make him reconciled? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound, the three-level magic dagger that was destroyed by the flame-blasting technique fell on the thick carpet, giving a dull sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the stimulation of the five-level magical "flame strike", the magical power fluctuations in the entire room reached an extreme, but still almost penetrated The invisible mask failed to alarm the great knights and knights in the castle of the castle in the best of Lun. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Lu’s magical items are expected to have four or five levels, Matvey naturally does not care to arrange the hidden magical array according to the five-level standard. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible curtains are difficult to maintain, and Lucien is a magician, and Petrov’s horror in a few seconds of defeat, let Mattvi It was difficult to maintain the invisible state, and the appearance of the Ivanovsky room in the window outside Lucian appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien, who had passed the spelling buffer, turned his head and looked out the window without hesitation, his eyes flashed deep and the mental field locked. Matvey in the air outside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invisible fluctuations occur, and Mattwei, who blessed himself with "mechanized mind" and "magic armor" before the action, suddenly saw the transparent armor that could protect the soul from being attacked to a certain extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief impression on Lucien, he quickly woke up, but the soul was still slightly stinging, causing a little dizziness and difficulty concentrating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a fascinating human? Why is the impact on the soul so strong?!" Matvey has a layer of defense that counteracts the effects of most fascinating humans, so The vertigo of the soul is not serious. Even under the accident, the mental power can not stimulate the spell model in the body temporarily, but the magic items can still be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he gave his magic boots firmly and without any hesitation, and before the second magic of Lucien, a flash disappeared into the original Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a vague observation of Peter Love’s end, understanding that there is a slight carelessness, followed by a storm and a combination of attacks that make it difficult for people to die until they die. You must first avoid it, so you immediately use the three-ring magic "short-range teleport" that comes with the magic item! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossien, who is in the caster buffer, can’t use the “Elemental Order” to destroy the magic items used by Matvey, but he is powerfully equipped with many Calmly inspired the "element" ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the window, a group of deep yellow-green mist emerged out of thin air, covering the upper and lower three floors of more than sixty rooms outside the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mist, several tall, dark green coniferous trees planted in the castle courtyard are immediately mottled, and the insects hidden inside are only stiff and falling, quickly rot... ... as if no life can survive in this fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the five-ring magic, this is "Gasdon's poisonous fog"! Without precautions, even if you breathe a little mist, you will be poisoned and killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teleported Mattway can't cross such a wide range, when he flashes in the air, the surroundings are still yellow-green fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a magician, Matvey has full vigilance against fog, and immediately holds his breath and then casts the spell in the soul. ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are prepared to stabilize and then use the "dispersing smoke" to disperse the yellow-green fog, after all, it takes a certain time to completely disperse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What scares him is that his second-ring magic air filter bubble is a little bit stained in the yellow-green fog, and it can’t be completely filtered to clear the play. Poisonous mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the magic of the five rings? Asshole, how many intermediate magic items does this damn guy have?!" Mattaway understands "air filter" Limit, it can only deal with toxins produced by magic below four rings. So, I immediately knew the horror of the mist around me, and at the same time, incredulous and hateful cursing Lucine with so many powerful magic items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think this is the root of their own failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, let Mattevi’s horror happened, and his skin began to fester without warning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This five-ring poisonous mist can actually penetrate into the body through skin contact, and can penetrate the "protective energy damage" magic without any hindrance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a unique magic?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattvi's brain is a bit fuzzy However, the infiltration type of mist effect is not as good as direct breathing, so it is considered to be a lot of dangers for him, forcibly keeping calm and starting to inspire a magical magical "gasification shape" attached to the magic robe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he uses this magic, he will be vaporized into a virtual body, temporarily getting rid of the erosion of poisonous fog, but the same, as a virtual body, he can not be normal Casting, can only fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lucien can make him wish, "Elemental Order" is re-energized, and Matthew's magic robe just flashes and fades down, and countless Hole! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this magic?" Matte, who quickly turned into a pus, flashed the last thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
