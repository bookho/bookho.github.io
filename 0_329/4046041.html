			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——The traffic jam just arrived, sorry sorry. ................................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the hall of the Musicians Association, Elena looked at the door anxiously from time to time, and it was time to see it. Lucien hadn’t come yet. Today, he managed the library on the first day and had to take him to see him. Mr. Hank, who is in charge of the usual affairs of the association, although he will not lose the job even if he is late, there will be a bad impression on Mr. Hank, and it will inevitably be criticized and killed in the future. If you are known by Mr. Wolf, it is very likely that you will use this matter to make it difficult and insult him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Elena standing, the same blond girl Kathy, who is also responsible for the reception, looks at Elena with the green eyes like the lake, curious and funny asking Road: "Elena, who are you waiting for? This kind of performance is not like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Musicians Association is responsible for the reception of two people. Group, but when Lucien first came, Elena had another companion to go to lunch for George’s relationship, and for the second time, Casey just took another guest to the third floor. Visiting a councillor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a friend, he wants to work in the association. Lucien, you are finally here." Wearing a light white dress, pure and beautiful as an angel Elena, relieved, came out from behind the wooden cabinet and walked to Lucien. "Hey, how is your face so bad? Are you sick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although Lucien couldn't see his face, it could be imagined how pale and weak. After going back and forth to Sir Wien's manor, the pain and dizziness of his head was more serious, and his forehead was still hot: "I I think I am really sick, my head is a little hot, but it is not serious. Elena, take me to see Mr. Hank, well, thank you for your concern." This external performance from the soul is not good. The general doctor of the church can treat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, anyway, the library work is very leisurely, especially today is the time to pray." Elena used her eyes to signal Kathy, then bring Lu Xien went to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hank is a thin, serious, formal-looking middle-aged man, but he did not have a hard time, Sean, simply asked about his name, age, and After the physical condition, let Elena lead the way to the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Pieru Sang, who is responsible for the morning work of the library. It’s a person who likes music but has a strange name.” Going to the second floor On the way to the music library, Elena introduced her companion to Lucien, but she was not a girl who was good at saying bad things about others. After thinking for a while, she used only "surprise of strange name" to describe Piero. "It is that. People who talk often make people unable to understand his ideas, but fortunately other aspects are still normal, not lonely, Lucian you normally get along with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Those who can do this kind of work with less salary are sure to have a relationship with the Musicians Association. Lucien also doesn't want to meet people who are too troublesome. After listening to Elena's introduction, I finally feel relieved: "Thank you, Elena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the two went to the music library, which was very quiet and occupied half of the entire second floor. It is said that thousands of books on music theory and so on, and most of the officially recorded music are collected. Each issue, as well as "Music Review" "Symphony Herald" newspaper and other past data, in addition to a small amount so that the musicians refer to religious books, travel and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 8:30, musicians, musicians, no one came, there was almost no sound in the library, a black-haired brown, some The slender, thin and delicate young boy, sitting in the chair behind the wooden cabinet, quietly looked at the music in his hand, focusing on a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this picture, left a first impression on Piero, Lucien: "Sure enough, it is a soft boy who likes music to indulge." <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena whispered: "Piedru, Pieru... Well, this is your companion, Lucien, who will manage the library with you in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the continuous shouts, Pierou finally awake from the music, looked up, brown pupil with a little confused: "Good morning, Elena "Is it a week of worship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Pieru, I am Lucien Evans." Lucien held back his head and pain. Smile introduce yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after the introduction, his gaze gaze on Lucian's face, just as Lucien thought he would ask, "Are you sick?" When this kind of polite care, Pieru suddenly said:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, take care of your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These sentences are nothing, even appropriate. But the deep smile on Pieru’s face seemed to say “I understand, men know”, so the whole sentence becomes very strange, like what is blaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy, I just thought about something in my mind, how can I come to this conclusion without going through the long and rugged thinking." Guess what he meant, and had a deep understanding of his thinking jump, no wonder Elena said that he often said something that others could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the side, Elena sneaked a smile at Lucien, as if to say, "Look, that's what I said."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I have to go down. Lucien, work hard, here is the treasure of the whole association, you have to know how to use it." Elena pointed to the bookshelf Books, music, newspapers, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving Elena, Pieru walked with Lucien to the wooden cabinet and briefly explained: "Lu Xien, My thoughts are like inspiration, always coming out from various places. Sometimes, you may not understand, don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I understand." Lucien had a deep understanding of his thinking jump, and then could not help but ask: "What thoughts have you made before I asked me to take care of my body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piyru "snapped" a cry: "I saw you pale, walking unsteadily, well, Lucien, take care to keep your body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a smile on his face that everyone knows. As for the specific process of thinking, there is absolutely no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has a feeling of being defeated by him, and the impression that Piedu "likes music to indulge in the weak boy" has become unconsciously "The guy who likes music but is very wretched." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After introducing the things that the librarian needs to do to Lucien, Pirie didn’t care too much: "This library is only internal to the association." The people can come in, so there are not many people who read and borrow books every day. Especially in the morning, Lucien, as long as the musicians and musicians come to be polite, there is no other problem. Well, you turn one. Familiar with the circle, I continue to read the "Twelve Equal Rhythm Piano Collection", which is the "Sacred Code" of piano music!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling music, wretched Piero has a completely different brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Scriptures is a religious classic of the Truth. It is used as a metaphor to show the status of the Twelve Equal Piano Collection, even on Earth. Bach's 48 "Average Piano Collection" is also known as the "Old Testament" of piano music. As for the "New Testament" of piano music, it is Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, including "Moonlight". Famous songs such as "Storm" and "Sorrow". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien happened to have this idea and nodded with no hesitation - seeing so many books in front of them, Lucien always has them all The idea of ​​being included in your own soul library is like a squirrel who always likes to collect pine cones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to a bookshelf, Lucien took out a book and flipped it up. After a few minutes, the soul library produced a correspondence. The book is then taken out of the next one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, Piedru, who was addicted to the world of music, soon noticed Lucy’s quirky performance, and went to his body very curiously and doubtfully. Next: "Lu Xien, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and fooled Piedru: "I heard that there are talented musicians, like I’ve written the inspirational melody that I’ve got in the cracks of the books and music that I’m reading, so I’m trying to see if I can find them. If they haven’t published yet, then I’ll be a musician soon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Pieru looked at Lucien with a dubious suspicion. Just now he was looking for music and melody in the cracks of the book. "Colain, the most important music. Or is it basic, or else you can use those melodies to be famous, what should you do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
