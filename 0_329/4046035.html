			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s face rotted a lot, and the rough rot was filled, and he could see the panic and struggle before his death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Lucien can no longer find anything and traces related to his strange cause of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the connection with the recent low-key of the Aaron gang?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a few minutes, Lucien found a rag, wrapped his hand, and then pressed Andre’s body into the water, although he did not know how he was caught by the wire mesh, but this time, Not so lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre’s body followed the flow of the dark river, passed through the wire fence, and was rushed to the Belém River. As for who was discovered afterwards, it was not the road. Sean can control it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing the purse and rags in the dark river, Lucien stood up and returned to the back, but this time, Lucien did not come. At the time of the road, but at a fork road twenty meters away, the direction has changed, so as not to encounter the group of beggars again, and this road, according to Lucien, will follow the route that he has come in. The ruins of the witch magic lab return to the entrance to the sewer that they entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning a few meters at the fork, Lusien suddenly heard a heavy footstep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These footsteps are messy and patchy, passing so far and so clear in a quiet, closed sewer, like a large group of people coming far away, and Several of them are very exaggerated, so they will have such a heavy effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has a back and looks at the ramp that he walks. He quickly found a depression in the front not far, although Not enough to cover up your body, but as long as those who come over don't come in and look carefully, they can't find it from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back was tightly attached to the wall, and Lucien waited for a few minutes, and finally waited for the group to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s too smooth in the past, and there haven’t been any problems, so this group of people just casually looked at Lucy’s hidden ramp and continued to move forward. Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Several of you, throw these bodies away. May the Lord bless, they will be eaten by the squid." A low voice sounded, It came from far inside the closed and quiet sewer, but when he spoke, it seemed to be leaky, so many syllables were not allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was going to take this opportunity to leave, but this voice made him frown: "How familiar is it, who is it?" Everyone I have met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is a familiar voice from Sean: "How do you collect so slowly, don't delay the big thing."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the old man who tried to preach." The second voice, because Lucien had not heard it for a long time, so he recognized it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first voice was silent, and answered with a faint fear: "Reassured, within ten days, must be together, Aaron boss has already told. At all costs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron, Longsang? Aaron? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien immediately recalled the owner of the first voice, who brought people to smash his home and was beaten by himself and John. Jackson, his feeling of leaking the air, is because he has been knocking down several teeth: "It sounds like, Aaron gang is not like a victim, but it is like an accomplice of a cult, then Andrei is not willing to The service was thus ruined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the missionary smiled sullenly: "Please tell Mr. Aaron and the person, as long as you can cooperate wholeheartedly, we definitely do not Will disappoint you, don't see that I have no strength, but under the glory of God, I am only the smallest crawler. Several priests are strong enough to praise the bishop of truth. If you don't want to maintain that thing, you don't need you. Come help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, I will tell Aaron boss." Jackson answered with a low mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man of the mission snorted: "Of course, it was rushed into the Belém River and became a food for the squid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson gently sucked Tone: "Ska, don't worry, Aaron boss has not said it, at all costs. As long as we don't provoke aristocrats, pastors and high society people, even if they kidnapped others, he will solve all relationships and resources. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jackson boss, do you have a goal?" Ska asked hesitantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson sneered: "Scar, you have seen, done so many things, want to quit? Don't forget Andrea! As for the goal Hey, my cheeks are still faint, the two bastard kids, and their family, how can they let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence, Lucian almost couldn't help but anger. In order to avoid more serious hatred, Jackson had wanted to kill himself with Alice. It was really poisonous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon, Lucien controlled the anger, because such wonderful people, I have heard a lot, for a few dollars, for a sentence There is no such thing as killing the whole family: "I have heard it, but I can still cope with it, but Uncle Joel, Eliza, and Ai Wen may not be spared."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This must be resolved as soon as possible." Lucien quietly pondered and started to kill. If Jackson was allowed to leave the sewer, where would I go to find them, by then, I can't help myself. How can I protect the Joel family? Who knows when and where Jackson will attack? "As long as they are killed, the others of Aaron's gang will not remember for no reason." With us, with this buffer of time, we can make an excuse to disclose to John and let him solve the problem of this cult through Sir Wien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To At the time, as long as Lucien told John, he happened to listen. Beggars in a blasphemous remarks aired on the line, beggars living in the sewers, as long as the church or the Knights to a sewer careful exploration, should find some clues as to excuse himself made up, will die anyway, no check against. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien is not doing it now, and reporting directly through John, as long as the old man and the cult beggars are caught, they have been there. The sewer thing can't be explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien became more calm and touched his pocket, confirming that the casting materials were easy to take, and by the cover of their voices, the footsteps went slightly. At the corner, cautiously spying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have a total of nine people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many people, Lucian is not completely sure to kill everyone, even the possibility of being killed by them, but at this time I can't back down, I can only calmly fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ska and two companions will be the last sack wrapped in a corpse Throwed into the dark river, and then smashed and smashed with a long smash, so that they could make a big hole deliberately made through the barbed wire. Due to the intertwined emotions of fear, fear, regret, etc., the three gangsters could not help but pray in their hearts. The god of truth does not dare to look at the body, or even avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they are all villains who have had human lives, they can’t accept the things that have been dug up in the heart of a living person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the mysterious old man, Ska held back his heart and shivered: "Jackson's big brother, when things are done, we will leave soon, I heard. There are a lot of water ghosts in the Belen River, if you swim in..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Jackson looked at the old man, "There is a water ghost in the Belem River." Is there any relationship with you? After all, throwing so many corpses into it, the time is quite consistent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head and shook his head: "We don't want to succeed in things." Before the other movements, Aalto is the western core of the ancient magical empire. Perhaps there is a strong death force in some parts of the Belem River. In short, the truth cult has not noticed us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson had just told his men to leave, and suddenly saw Ska’s expression become frightened, and at the same time there was a strange, sly, short and rushing voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
