			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Sky, the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley has become accustomed to this magnificent building, no longer amazed at the shape of other magic towers, only the inner love and appreciation . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as soon as you see this magic tower, Berkeley has a kind of stability and practicality, no longer afraid of not being afraid, no longer as often as in the past. Woke up, worried about being found by the night watchman and sending it to the firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the magician's paradise..." Berkeley closed his eyes and gently sighed, then the heart seemed to burn a flame, she still today Will it be there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paced up, passing through the Hall of Magic Tower and directly into the first district of the first floor of the "Organic Arcane Library." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many arcists are used to reading or researching directly in the library after borrowing books, this will give them the quickest time to understand what information is still missing. Therefore, the Magic Council established a “reading room” in a spare space in the district to provide a quiet reading space for the arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, many arcans found that the environment here is very suitable for reading books that do not need to be experimented, and they have come here to study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley took two thick black cover books from the storage bag, took a deep breath, and pretended to look carefully, slowly entering The "reading room". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he entered, his gaze looked toward the window, hoping to see a beautiful figure there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's really coming again!" Berkeley had a surprise inside, and his expression couldn't keep up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shines through the window, quietly pouring on a beautiful girl, she is focused and indifferent, the facial features are exquisite, the lips are black and blue Through the fascinating charm, coupled with the halo caused by the sun, the whole person is like an ice elf, difficult to draw difficult to paint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most beautiful and attractive woman among Berkeley’s escapes across the continent, so much so much that he was wasted "reading" this week. Inside the room, quietly admiring the girl, it is difficult to extricate herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can't go on like this..." Berkeley said to himself, as if he had made up his mind to work hard. "Nobody knows her next week." I still don't come to the reading room. After all, she rarely came before, she must know her, can't miss it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave himself a sigh of relief, after a few seconds Finally made up his mind and took the book to the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, just know friends normally!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before contacting the noble lady Courage to come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas emerging in Berkeley's mind, consciously vain and weak as the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl looked at the books in her hand, from time to time on the draft paper, did not notice Berkeley's approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hair is made of ice crystals, crystal clear on the sun, reflecting the faint colorful halo, seeing Berkeley dazzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected lady, can I sit here?" Berkeley asked dryly, feeling that his voice was a little trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shashasha, the sound of the feather pen across the paper is not interrupted, this beautiful girl has not lifted her head, still focused on the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected lady, can I sit here?" Berkeley asked the timid who turned and left, asking again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, The book flips, this elf-like girl seems to be nowhere to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illusion? Berkeley thought without confidence, but he immediately told himself, no matter what, as long as she did not directly object, then agree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
