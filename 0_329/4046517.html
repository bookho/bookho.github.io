			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes of sneaking north along the Solna Valley, Lucien took Natasha and changed direction, using higher flying, towards the east. The face flew, and relieved the faint radiance of Natasha's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I intend to draw the attention of the demigod lich to us, so that Amir Kamil can successfully leave Husum City and go to the eastern desert?" Tasha did not complain about Lucine’s move without prior notice. Instead, he accepted it with confidence and was keenly aware of his purpose. This was the tacit understanding of several births and deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Natasha, in the eastern desert, there is a secret contact point for the Magic Council, which can use the sound transmission array to return the message to the opposite side of the sea. Control area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you know the whereabouts of Lucian and the exact location and coordinates, Fernando and Hathaway can return to the main material world first, and then open another different The Gate of the Circle leads directly to the northern mountains of the Eldo Peninsula. Although it takes a day or so, it can be many times faster than the sea and the desert in this space where the speed of flight is limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a Knight rides from Husum City to the contact point in the East Desert. If you are familiar with the specific location of the semi-cured space barrier, you only need less than Two days, if not familiar, will be extended to three to four days, unfortunately, Camille belongs to the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high-speed flight, the wind whistling, the chilly, Lu Xien smiled and nodded, through the soul of the two connected: "If half When the god lich resurrected and returned to Husum City, he could not find any traces of us. Then he would definitely look for other people, especially with the main goal of Kamil Aunt who is closely related to us. At that time, he can not only know us. For the real purpose, let us wait for the hope of the teacher and Hathaway's mother-in-law to be defeated, and threaten you with Camille aunt, so we have to smother the hidden dangers when they are not present."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Yes, if the demon lich is able to 'lock' our whereabouts, it will surely chase it, so as not to lose the opportunity, so that Camille Aunt can get time to recover as long as it hides and hides." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When time, when she left Husum City, the spiritual power of this legendary peak was suppressed to a world within three hundred meters, half god The lich wants to look back at her, it is very difficult, only through life The trajectory, this is a very easy way to deviate, and, less than a day, Camille Aunt can rush back to the mountains in the northeast, into the control of Lord Valenhill, the demigod lich unless you want to be single Sweeping the whole church, otherwise it is impossible to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha flies in the air like a sharp arrow, helping Lu Xien to finish the words, by the way Tell him the approximate location of Warren Hill, so as not to crash into it. This can't be used to provoke Warren Hill and the demigod lich to fight for the two to escape, because Warren Hill has a way to inform the church that once he knows about it, Lucian will face the pope. The saints, cardinals, and holy knights are 10,000 times more dangerous than they are now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, so this time, we have to hold back the half-god lich." Lucian said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked the left eyebrow: "You don't worry about Aunt Camille telling you about your visit to Wallen Hill?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can this kind of danger be considered, and as long as seven days have passed, Aitna absorbed the debris, even if faced with the Pope, I am not a chance to survive, say I believe in you." Lucien answered seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s mouth curled up and smiled and said: “So I told Amir Kamil that it’s only four days to absorb it. Fragment, if she did not sell you, the message was sent to the area controlled by the Magic Council, no matter whether Aitna recovered, the storm dominates Lord and Hathaway will definitely come to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if she betrayed you, when the Pope rushed them, the time was almost three days. The thought of facing is about returning to the level of the goddess of Etna. The Pope, who has no gods, may not be willing to take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head and looked up and down Natasha, sighing: "I I always thought that you like to go straight in the battle and deal with things, but you can grasp the hearts of people with such precision. However, Camille Auntie has been with you for so many years, you actually deceive her, are not afraid of her sad?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After jokes, her expression was solemn: "Although I prefer to rely on my own strength, but live in the aristocratic circle, and as the heir to the Grand Duke, a little bit of a point is the end of being betrayed by Verdi's cousin. I believe that Aunt Camille will not betray me, but she will not betray you, I can not be sure, maybe in her opinion, send you to the firearm, let me from the danger of being chased by the demon lich Getting rid of is the best love for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't put our safety on 'I want to believe'."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lucien seems to have seen a true female grandfather, decisive, cautious, not blinded by feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this simply means not being judged by feelings, rather than choosing the path you want from the emotional point of view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled softly: "It has already come to this step, other things are not within our control ability, we are in the north and east directions." Alternately, let the demigod lich think that we are using an irregular route to the east desert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just finished this sentence in the soul connection Lu Xi'en's left hand once again spread a layer of solidified black and white gray, wrapping his whole person, so the high-level flight failed, and he went to the ground, and the strange and inexplicable atmosphere of the spirits exudes at the same time, just like in the night. The torch, which can be seen far away, seems to break through the suppression of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha, a dive, hugged Lucien, and then pulled out the "pale justice" and swayed to the layer of tedious colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword is in the middle of the defeat, this time actually did not directly smash, Natasha brows slightly wrinkled, continue to sniper, after three full, that The layer black and white gray is broken and converged and re-suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Natasha asked about the change with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calmly said: "Don't worry, the resistance will occasionally be fierce. It is estimated that when it is almost completely absorbed, He will have a very long time to retire. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Elena recovers, you have to pay for Him, or else it is not so dangerous." Natasha Just kidding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hint of doubt in Lucien’s face: “Actually, I’ve got a little reward. Every time I freeze, I have a world around me. Feeling, and my soul continues to grow without hindrance under the influence of the cognitive world. Especially for the first time, I seem to have directly grown over two years. Now the soul has a level of seven rings, waiting for me. Analyze a seven-ring magic and try to improve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You already have the soul level of the seven rings? I am more than your level." Natasha asked with some surprise and then made a disappointment and frustration. "It is unfair. It was all chased by the demigod lich. You have such a big improvement, but I have nothing, wait for this incident. After that, you must repay me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as it is not a request for angels, you can promise." Lucien debunked Natasha Hidden mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha raised a brow, "cold" and said: "Then you fly up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Lucien found himself holding Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long day, in a small town near the northern mountains, Lucy En and Natasha gasped in a mud house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can an uncontrolled episode of the Undead Fragment be irregular? Otherwise we can hide and act according to the rules, unlike now, the Semi-God Lich sends out After the death of the corporal corps of the Necromancer, the changes in our whereabouts are slowly decreasing, the scope of activities begins to be compressed, and we must guard against sneak attacks and tracking at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Natasha stared sharply at Lucien’s left hand, the guy who hurts! However, I heard that it is a blonde "girl" who looks beautiful and beautiful. Oh, it seems to be tolerable. Also, Lucien, this guy, is always involved in the danger, it is really unreliable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
