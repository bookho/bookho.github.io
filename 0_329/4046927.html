			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets of Heidler City are not as messy and dirty as Donnie’s imagination, all over rotting corpses; instead, they are clean and wide, and pedestrians are also Quite a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the busy and noisy streets are very quiet, almost no one shouts loudly, even the exchanges between them are fine. As if there is a strange power here to ban the noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a closer look, Downey discovered that the "pedestrians" who traveled were mostly undead, and there were dead dogs with eyes and demonized red eyes. Go, revealing the flesh-and-blooded "no skins", as well as common ghosts, zombies and cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, among these undead creatures, there are also necromancers wearing dark black magic robes, most of whom are not as gloomy as Donnie imagined. It’s a rigid face, the same smile when talking to your peers, but the sound is pressed low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately there is no lich..." Downey whispered a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Heidler City, Sami’s spirit seems to be exceptionally good, although it’s still a sleepy look, but at least not yawning, he’s stunned. Hey, he messed up like a bird's nest hair and smiled: "Mr. Lichs mostly don't like shopping..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said that they basically have no desire in this regard. Down... Henry sideways let a hell dog with three heads, it is tall and strong, with a burning flame in the corner of his mouth, but wearing a collar on his neck, pulled by a petite female magician. Running slowly in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hell dog and the bull are almost the size..." When the female magician went away, Downey couldn’t help but say that this contrast is too Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami smirked and said: "I saw a Mr. Lich in the mid-air scorpion dragon, almost as many as a hundred dogs." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived in Heidel City yesterday, temporarily living at 152 Ghouker Street, waiting for the students who arrived today to go to the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Awesome." Downey looked at the sky with admiration, at this time. They have already reached the Ghoul Street, and the magic tower that goes straight into the sky makes it impossible to ignore its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, an ivory skull floated out. There are two needle-shaped red awns in the eye socket, which are different and unique. His two rows of teeth open and close, making a harsh sound without undulations: "All freshmen gather, go to the college, and then arrive and wait for the day after tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is hard to hear It was as if someone was scratching the bones with rusty iron, so that Downey had a slight shudder and walked into the hall with Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show your letter of acceptance and the identity mark inside." Downey was still standing in the future, and a man with a blank expression came over. His face was sallow, and the blood vessels were clearly visible. His eyes were the same needle-like red awns as the lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey quickly took out the letter of admission and a black beetle: "Yes, teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me Mr. Robert." The man's voice was strangely gentle and mellow. When I looked at the black beetle, it seemed to reflect a faint red awn. "Well, Downey, don't need to apply for accommodation. Follow us directly to the college."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After finishing, he returned the letter and the beetle to Downey, and he said: "Exactly, I am one of the mentor in the field of body structure and genetics. I hope that you will not live up to your current achievements and foundation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment. Sami looked at Robert, who had already walked to the other side of the hall. He whispered: "It is said that Mr. Robert is very close to the high level. Well, his body has been transformed many times by himself. No one knows what speciality his body has. Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Robert gave me a lot of pressure..." In the cold environment of Heidler, Downey also developed a bit of cold sweat. Then I looked at Robert's gaze and saw him parked in front of the live screen in the hall, watching the funny entertainment inside, and his mouth was sketched with a look of suspicious smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don’t think that Mr. Robert’s dead face also loves watching TV...” Downey’s expression said with a slight horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Downey was defeated by Sami, and quickly shifted the subject. "I am going to college immediately. I heard that the college is not in the city, in a mysterious place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sami seriously nodded: "I heard that it is a place that is very suitable for the Necromancer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talked about this matter, There has been a strong curiosity, and there are speculations about where is it inside the giant tomb? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the ivory lich flew back and continued to use the ugly voice: "Follow me, don't lose, Once lost, I will default that you are dead and will not go looking for it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence lifts Downey’s heart, even Sa The so confused and sluggish people also widened their eyes and the whole team became extremely silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the lich, Downey and others passed through Ghouls Street, crossed Soul Avenue, crossed the Brain Square, and arrived at a It looks like a building that is no different from other magic towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the college?" Downey looked at the magic tower in front of him with a disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lich stopped and floated in front of the magic tower, and uttered a hoarse and cumbersome mantra in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of shadow emerges from the patterned rock on the ground, spreads and grows, and soon covers the door, making it dark and deep, and the surface is gently shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me." The lich gave a cold voice, did not open the door, directly into the shadows, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This surprise makes Downey and Sami hold their breath again, and slowly move slowly after the apprentice in front, not knowing where the shadow will lead. At the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, moving slowly, they still went to the "shadow gate", a bite, Donnie walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body seems to have been immersed in the depths of the lake, dull and depressed, it was the feeling of being drowned when he was a child. Then, Downey only felt the body light, from the water "Get out of it, a black and white gray in front of you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a messy and decadent city. Except for the tedious black and white ash, there is no slight color, even the wind is solidified in the air, like a quiet A strange sketch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at the sky and saw that it was as gray and bleak as Heidel, but could no longer see the sun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic knowledge about the alienation space quickly emerged in Downey’s mind, and he shouted loudly to the side of Sami, who was sluggish: “The Dead World!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after blurting out, Downey did not hear even a little noise. Everything is so quiet, like the eternal darkness and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a dead world, Donnie sighed. The body has a fascinating "illusion", and only here is the place that is best suited for the dead spirits. However, I heard that it is very dangerous. Even high-ranking magicians have the possibility of degeneration. After all, there is no wisdom of undead creatures. It does not matter what background you have, what forces belong to them, whether there is money at home, they only have a desire for fresh flesh and blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me. Repeat again, don't lose." The Lich didn't know what spells were used, and the sound rang in everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey patted Sami, who was next to him, alert and followed the lich. For fear of getting out of the ranks, I will face the tideless undead in the realm of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quiet "city", and the team stepped into a deserted wilderness with wandering ghouls and rotten faces. The expression is embarrassing, it seems to be able to "smell" the indescribable stench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And further afield, there are quite a few half-fuzzy ghosts, they float in the air, and their bodies change into black robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This environment. Such a scene, so that the ghost behind Sami is uplifted, holding his head up, making a silent scream, holding his hands up and waving before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
