			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Duke of Frost" Memphis stepping into the pub, the surroundings suddenly became quiet, without a trace of quiet silence, like the frozen plain covered by a blizzard outside Dead and cold, eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty years is better than 30,000 years?" It is likely that the old man of the legendary magician in the soul field laughed and apparently thought that "the Lord of Secrets" Memphis It is not credible to play the character of the devil and deceive others with some real exaggerated words. "In the last ten years, you rarely walked out of the 'silent iceberg', and I doubt that you have quietly descended into the material world. Why is it coming to my tavern today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is reminding Lucien that the "secret of the Lord" is likely to be planning what the Lord is involved in this decade. The big plot of the material world, so don't be deceived by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis Haha laughed, then walked to the front of the bar, sat next to Lucien, reached for a bottle of "flaming wine" and a bottle of water "Soul Wine", began to modulate its favorite mixed taste: "I am not exaggerating my words, you ask Evans to know, even his own existence is the most powerful evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a familiar look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three legends, one bartending behind the bar, two sitting on the high chair in front of the bar, the bar is wine, wine glass and dim Candlelight, it looks no different from the scene of a regular pub, who can think of this as three legends? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" The old man heard the repetition of Memphis and began to face his words. "The first 30,000 years of the ancient magical empire, there is a legendary magic." With the completion of the complete faction division, with the initial magic system, with basic mathematical and astronomical knowledge, with the attempt of various alchemy items, with the synthesis of blood, can these be done within 30 years?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born in the last glory stage of the ancient magical empire, like an old aristocrat, who never forgets the glory of the past, therefore, although he is more concerned about the Magic Council and The development of Arcane has not been added. Similarly, it cannot accept the things that the ancient magical empire did in the first 30,000 years. The "Arcane" only takes 30 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of Frost" looked quiet and listened, as if Lu Xien did not care about his affairs, smirked: "These thirty years, to the big side Say, understand the mystery of gravity, find the sun..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an arcane master, of course, the words will not be rigorous, if you change to Lucien, It will definitely only say that there is a preliminary study and harvest on the nature of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, found the sun?" The old man wiped the dry fur of the glass and fell, interrupting Memphis's story, his eyes full of shock and watching it and Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the sun, the existence of the sun, is a problem that has plagued the empire for tens of thousands of years. No magician wants to crack this secret, and he is no exception. But even if it is a genius, such as "Sun King" Tanos, good at the astronomical prophecy, such as Mr. Muskillin, the strength of the tyrannical approach to the likes of the gods such as "the star of the mentor" - the first legendary peak of the magic empire, have to be in this In the face of the problem, lower your noble head and admit that you are far from the essence of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the sun is discovered? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Frost did not mention his own intentions at all. It seemed to be a shock to appreciate the old man. He smiled and pointed to Lucien: " Of course, this is the discoverer, the creator of the system of relativity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Sun you discovered? The relativistic system?” The old man hurriedly asked, what is relativity system? When you leave the main material world, the Magic Council should have no "nouns" in this respect. But after 30 years of "short" time, the world has become so strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not respond positively, very rigorously characteristic of the Arcanist: "Strictly speaking, the main reason for discovering the sun is not the theory of relativity, it is only one of them. Minor factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know less about arcane, don't lie to me... The old man is born with such a sentence, and quickly come out and don't know it. How many dust crystal balls began to divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is in "Silent Hell", the effect of divination is very limited, but at this time, "Duke of Frost" knocked on the table and let go of the plane The suppression, so the old man got the conclusion: "I really found the sun... What happened to the world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the world is all about, but a legendary peak enters 'silent hell'. I should always take a look at it, lest the day of the 'silent iceberg' be besieged and I don't know what it is." The sinister Lord said with a smile and awkwardly, it’s not like looking at the situation, it’s like coming over and completing a commercial transaction with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary peak?" The old man once again glared at Lucien, although he could not know all the high-level magicians and masters of the parliament, but the members of the highest jury Still know, thirty years ago, this young man certainly did not enter the legendary field, and in just 30 years, he became a legend and broke through to the peak? It’s even more exaggerated than Brooke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, Evans learned magic only fifteen or six years, oh, that is, the year when my predecessor was completely degraded, he officially became "The Frost Duke" deliberately added, and then sneered in the old man's shocked expression. "Now it is not an ancient magical empire. After seclusion for hundreds of years, it can still become a big man who reverses the situation. At present, who is Seclusion, do not care about the development of arcane, then maybe ten or twenty years, he will be completely out of date, can not keep up with the times, not only can not become behind the scenes or key forces, but also will be crushed by the wheel of the times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be laughing at the fact that the old man has been in seclusion for 30 years and found the world's great change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fiveteen or six years..." The old man has been unable to express his own mind in words. What can he do in fifteen or six years? Beginning with my own magic, fifteen or six years is the five-ring Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again confirmed with a crystal ball that Lucien had not covered up the information, and sighed long: "Light is your existence, it can really explain How terrible the rapid development of these decades has been."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sighing, his eyes became hot and staring at Lucien: "You just It is said that the Magic Council can only make breakthrough progress in the progress of soul research?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a theoretical way." Lucien does not understand Why should the Duke of Ice and Snow help him to win the trust of the old man, so he is somewhat cautious. "Old gentleman, don't you know what you think about the essence of the soul? For example, a soul has no past memories, and can never recover, nor has it been raised before. The way of thinking and character, even the fluctuations and temperament of mental power have changed. Can we say that this soul is the same as the soul of the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This..." The old man said, he is not without this problem. Thinking, lady next to him is a distinct but not extreme example - his special labeling method allows the soul volatility has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is both a philosophy and a difficult question in the field of the soul. It is obviously not easy to answer. The old man said after a long time: "I don't think so, the most important five of the soul." The characteristics have changed, and it is equivalent to a new soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we instill the memory of the past into the soul, and cultivate the way of thinking and character of the past, If the spell permanently changes its mental power fluctuations and breath, does it change back to the original soul? Is the soul born, higher than society, or social, artificially 'cultivated'?" En sharply asked, "In another case, a different soul merges with this soul, inheriting its memory, thinking, character and frequency, breath, but retaining the original memory, then it is not Is this the soul now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, the Duke of Memphis occupies the soul of your wife, simulating her memory and other characteristics, then it is equivalent to Your lady? Spirit What is the most basic feature, or the most essential thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looked at the "Mrs." next to him, his face was cloudy and uncertain, and it was difficult to answer. And the "Duke of Ice and Snow" next to it deliberately "active" the atmosphere: "In fact, for me, the most basic character of the soul is the core of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Knowing Mr. Evans, what do you think of this question?" The old man looked forward and looked forward to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "I have been to the spiritual world and saw the soul fireplace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead world? Soul fireplace?" The old man feels that he has been abandoned by the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien introduced the Necromancer and the soul fireplace, and then did not talk about his core research, but abstractly: "I think the soul should still There is a higher level, more essential feature, which is closely related to the 'soul fireplace'. In specific cases, I am afraid I can only wait for me to come back from ancient hell, and then publish papers to discuss with the Arcanists."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
