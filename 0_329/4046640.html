			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucien’s opinion, after Dieppe’s identification of the “Electromagnetic Field”, he submitted it to the Arcane Review Committee with a slight Strange but feels understandable: "It is said that the results of every breakthrough surname will get real-world feedback? It seems that I have to wait until there is an experiment or phenomenon confirmed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his view, the clear and generalization of the wave-particle two-image surname proposed by His Excellency Evans to all microscopic particles should be the most recent subversive surname breakthrough after general relativity and new alchemy, with the periodic table of elements. The difference in meaning seems to be that there should be real-world feedback, but he also understands that his own inference is based on the bold assumptions of whimsy. If there is no experimental observation of the electronic fluctuating surname, even he does not dare to completely Believe, he believes that he will not get real-world feedback until he finishes the experiment himself or sees someone else's experimental paper and verifies it. After all, this is a process that requires self-confirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electromagnetic? Mr. Marcus, Mr. Yana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Alchemy Life Full of metal texture, Dieppe's paper was handed over to the two authorities in the electromagnetic field. Because they were the papers of the high-level arcane masters, they were not distributed to the students or the editors of the "Electromagnetic" journal, but stayed On their desks, until they had finished their own research, they picked up the paper for review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus is a young, high-ranking magician with red hair and likes to wear black gloves like a night watchman, even if it is done Experiments and magic exercises will not take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "A hypothesis based on the theory of light quantum and its research"?" Black velvet gloves rubbed the surface of the paper, and Marcus frowned. He absolutely has no good feelings about "light quantum", which makes his understanding of electromagnetic waves fall into a state of utter disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this somewhat disgusting attitude, Marcus opened the paper, but after a few glances, after knowing the premise, his face There is a smile that is interesting: "Interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is about a few dozen pages, but the actual content is not complicated for Marcus, relatively It’s too long, it doesn’t take long, he laughs and laughs: “Electronics is a wave? It’s really worthy of Diyup’s thought... The wave-grained two-image surname can be promoted to this level, interesting and interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have seen the eyes of the particle theory supporters, and sighed softly: "But it is still a bold assumption, I don’t know when there will be an experiment. Support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus is not too convinced of Dieppe's paper, even if its core content is in line with its own taste, after the calculation, He wrote: "The very bold assumption is full of fascinating taste. It belongs to the electromagnetic field and is a real adventure for the world. With a strong subversion, because it is still a hypothesis, I can only recommend a temporary reward of 10 Arcane points after giving this paper a breakthrough surname, extremely important surname, highly discussed surname, and popular surname on microscopic particles. The Arcane point is two hundred, and the reward is added after the experiment is confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is from the wave of the second name of Lu Xienguang, Ma Ku Although Si believes that Dieppe's paper is very creative, it cannot be evaluated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing the review comments, Marcus re-sealed the paper and continued to review other papers. In his opinion, this is not a reliable hypothesis. Even if it is interesting, and then it is in line with your own mind, it is not worth spending your main energy to pay attention to and research. You only need to occasionally try the electronic fluctuating surname in your free time. You still have a lot of important things to do - at least for now. So far, no experiment can show the electronic fluctuating surname, and he can't think of the way to verify it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in Yana? Fei Amir's study, with a short linen hair, is laughing and leaning forward: "Electronics is a wave? This assumption is definitely not what normal arcadeists can think of. Dieppe is really an idea of ​​'openness'. Guy! Oh, his teacher Lavin must have given him the baptism of the saliva storm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, a really interesting paper, I really look forward to it. Those stubborns who support particle theory see the wonderful face of this paper. Later, they will mention the light quantum of Lord Evans, and we will respond with electronic waves.” Yana thought happily and shook his head again. It’s just a hypothesis, just like the original quantum of light, maybe a few years, after decades of experimentation, or perhaps never, it’s dusted in the dust of history.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considering it and restraining the impulse to praise this paper, Yana wrote: "The incredible genius association breaks through the shackles of the old ideas. It is the most shocking paper I have this year. However, the hypothesis is confirmed. It is always assumed that for this essay, which has both a surname, an extremely important surname, and a micro-domain popular surname, and has a very high discussion of the surname, I can only give a temporary opinion, rewarding eight Arcane points, and the Arcane Point. One hundred and fifty, I hope that all the Arcans will be able to verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Arcanists are encouraged to experiment, Yana himself soon forgot After the brain, before the task at hand, he may not have the extra time to verify this interesting hypothesis, after all, it is just interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the assessment quickly returned to Dieppe’s hands, and he was not surprised by the reward of only nine Arcane points. The paper is likely to only give evaluations with a certain amount of discussion, and then reward one or two arcane points. The two members of the electromagnetic field obviously like this assumption too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which journal should I vote for? "Electromagnetic", "Light and Dark", or "Ordinary Arcanist Monthly"?" Dieppe understands that it is not Austria The audit committee members have no influence on "Arcane" and "Magic". They will certainly not publish the papers that are only hypothetical, and the review of the "Elementary" journals will not be shredded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his discretion, a letter of covenant was sent to his desk by the servant:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;""Nature"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the influence of general relativity, the influence and number of subscriptions of Nature have risen sharply in the past six months. The name of the most authoritative journal in the field of mathematics and the ranks of major journals such as "Element" and "Star" is a very good choice for delivering papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of Lucien? Lord Evans is the honorary editor of the journal. Dieppe agreed to the draft of Nature with almost no hesitation. The journal seems to want to be influential outside the pure mathematical field and become the "Arcane" "Magic". "The same comprehensive surname authoritative journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Marcus and Yana’s intentional disclosure, no two In a week, some of the broad-spectrum arcane masters knew that there was such a novel paper and they exchanged it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electronic is a wave?" Larry looked at the paper in front of him with a funny smile. After reading it, he still felt that he was in a dream. "Diepu is not a way." Focus on scaring others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon and Lavendi have a good relationship, Larry and Dieppe are familiar, he smiled and shook his head, The paper was thrown aside and did not give up the mind to pay attention to this bold and ridiculous assumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warfare Division, Yurisian, who is lazy on the back of the chair, also looked at the paper with a smile, and licked the sore face Muscle: "If this paper is confirmed, it will really set off a headshot that is as much as the light quantum hypothesis is confirmed, especially this time there is no three-year buffer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "However, this is really hard to believe, even if I like this assumption very much." Yuris Ann left the paper aside and decided to try the design experiment after he was free. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Atomic Research Institute, Sprint, who has become a member of the highest scoring group, has also been promoted by Dieppe’s thesis, slightly ridiculed. Authentic: "Not everyone is a teacher, can make a bold and reasonable subversion assumption. Is electrons a wave? This is really the most humorous joke of the year, you can apply for the joke of "Allinge Impression" ranking."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the first to know about electronics, and the most arcane masters about electronic experiments. All experiments have undoubtedly confirmed one point: electrons are microscopic particles! This is no more than the loophole in the original light quantum hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the existing experiments don't support this." Heidi agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick wants to say something, but it feels too ridiculous, and can't find a good way to experiment, so with Katrina, Cherie, etc. The man also nodded and added: "No matter what, when we have time, the electronic wavelength design calculated according to this paper can make it a magical array of diffraction or interference. Only experiments can explain everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you try it anyway, you should be a match for your own arcane knowledge." Heidi smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They decided so happily that they didn’t tell the story to the teacher. In their opinion, this paper will not be too much even if it is someone else. Concern, not to mention the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, Fernando, Hathaway, Oliver and other arcanists see Dieppe’s papers, but they are more dignified than ordinary people, because this is from the waves The light quantum theory of particles is associated with a certain possible surname, but the difficulty of the experimental conditions still makes them not pay too much attention, just try to improve the current magical array in their free time, after all, they still have their own magic research and Arcane exploration to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is coming to early February, Lucien’s "vengeance gaze "It has been successfully built in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus, as a member of the Arcane Review Committee, got all the journals in the first time, but he only chose Arcane, Magic, and Electromagnetics. "Astrology, "Elements", "Nature" and other journals are read, while the rest are in abstract journals. After finding good content, they will go to the original text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting up the "Arcane", Marcus did not accidentally see the second issue of 825 on the cover, specifically to commemorate the general theory of relativity, this It is a great theory, thanks to Lord Lucien Evans, who gave us initial exposure to the essence of gravity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is every epoch-making arcane The results will be treated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the journal, the title page is Douglas's final assessment of Fernando and the "Prophet" Bergner Review:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a theory that transcends the times. It gives us a preliminary understanding of the nature of gravity is a curved space-time. Although the theoretical derivation is complicated, there are no loopholes, and based on the calculated value of this theory, Perfectly in line with the observations of the morning star's near-precession and the faster time on the artificial planet, we can basically think that it is the closest gravitational description of the current, and is one of the greatest achievements in The History of Magic. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you let me abandon all objective surnames to evaluate, then I will give it the most prominent position, it has an unparalleled theoretical beauty, will rule A major direction in the development of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The system of relativity allows us to enter the structure of the most basic concepts of arcane, deepening the most essential mystery, let The most attractive world is truly exposed For more 'beautiful faces', I recommend rewarding Lucien Evans and his theory of relativity for 30,000 arcane points, with 800,000 arcane points!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Marcus deeply sighed and did not feel that the evaluation was excessive. The system of relativity is the most simplified theory of electromagnetic phenomena in the current motion system. It has an impressive connotation, not to mention the gravitational essence. Explain that it is the fundamental problem that plagues generations of magical parliamentary arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The night of miracles, it’s a miracle night... things that happen this night will be praised by the latecomers, guessed and described with the greatest interest." Couss turned over this issue of "Arcane". After seeing the basics of relativity, he put it aside and prepared to look at it. After all, the content of general relativity is very difficult for him. The stage of learning geometric knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the journals such as "Magic", Marcus picked up "Nature" with the Evans geometry and tensor analysis paper he cares about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing through the catalogue, Marcus suddenly saw a familiar name: "A hypothesis based on the theory of light quantum and its research." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Nature" actually came up with this pure hypothesis?" Marcus frowned and thought, was Dieppe published through the relationship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip to the corresponding page number, Marcus’s gaze is slightly condensed, and there are editors under the title of the paper:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This paper may have opened the corner of the curtain and showed some truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously looked at the editor of the special editor The name, "Lu Xien? Evans" suddenly jumped into his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
