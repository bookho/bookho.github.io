			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cool breeze of the night is like water, and it calmly and infiltrates into the hearts of the people. Under such a light white moonlight, Sami only feels that his mind is sober, higher than the daytime. There is a lot of spirit in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...he still yawned, thinking in his heart, the best thing for such a beautiful night is to sleep, this is the greatest enjoyment of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind him stretched out his right hand and did not touch the door, let it slam open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donny, have you filled out the form?" Sami walked into the bedroom and asked casually, without any doubt about the answer, because he knew Tang. As long as Nepal makes up its mind, it will never be repented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Depression, confusion, and listless voices came from the corner, even if the confused Sami could hear the implied, so he Surprised to see the past, I saw the crystal lamp in the bedroom was extinguished, the silvery moonlight through the glass window, sprinkled on the desk and bookshelf, let them dye a layer of bright colors, and Downey sat near the bed Position, half of the face bathed in the moonlight, half of the face hiding in the deep darkness, looks so bleak and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Sami asked with amazement, and countless thoughts turned around in his head, but one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s voice is low and hoarse: “Evans introduced quantum theory into the field of body structure and genetic factors, treating life as a whole arcane system I think there is a basic unit of genetics that passes information to the next generation by means of copying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His description is stagnant, like a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." As the leader of the Necromancer, Sami is keenly aware of the exciting content from this short and inaccurate description. It is a theoretical hypothesis that creates surnames, breaks through surnames, and guides surnames. The Arcanists will be filled with enthusiasm for studying this field of life. At the same time, he is frowning with excitement and excitement. "In this way, Do we have to learn quantum theory in the future? Learn some formulas and equations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still not playing with **, no, studying the body and soul of the dead What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s expression is like crying: “There is no doubt that what you say will become a reality.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder you..." Sami suddenly realized and sympathizedly looked at Donnie. "You should know the matter after filling out the form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie breathed a sigh of relief: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to re-select, unless you wait for next year’s registration, his family condition is obviously not Allow him to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you can think about it from another angle. Since Evans is paying attention to this field, it shows that it has extremely high exploration and research value, and With the leadership of Lord Evans, there will be a series of achievements in creating surnames and surpassing surnames. In this period of time, we will gain a lot and get rich returns, just like the Atomic Research Institute, due to the madness of the microscopic field. Development, among the several major arcans, two have been promoted to the division, and the rest are also high-level magicians of the seven or eight rings.” Sami comforted Downey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s face was cloudy and uncertain, and several times he couldn’t speak, and finally it became a bitter smile:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June The sunshine is full of enthusiasm, and the examination room of the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools" is even more hot, like boiling oil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the apprentice who was admitted to the Primary Magic School and successfully learned the fifth grade was considered an elite a few decades ago, with the Arcane and Magic Universal Education The promotion of such an "elite" ratio is increasing year by year, and entering the Magic College for further study basically means that more than 50% may become a formal magician, jumping from the ordinary people's class to a high rank of the Lord and the Municipal Councillor. Social figures, and master the knowledge and strength, so not only the apprentices came to the examination room, but their parents, relatives, and friends also gathered outside the examination room to cheer for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For me, this kind of environment is simply a grave." Sami looked around, here is the Mills Aristocratic School, one of the examination rooms for the unified entrance exam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie wants to smile, but finds that his face muscles are a bit stiff: "No, for you, the grave is a good place, cold, quiet, Dead, how can you compare here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem a little nervous?" Sami raised his puffy eyes and looked at Downey, who had already decided to enter Heidler. The School of Magic, so I don't worry about the exam. It's just a passing. Of course, the premise is that you can't lose the standard. Otherwise, even if the Heidel School of Magic is strong, the application can't pass the "Arcane and Magic Education Committee". It is a newly established committee 20 years ago and is under the dual leadership of the Commission and the Magic Research Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie licked his dry lips and said: "Since I have made a choice, I have to go all out. If I can’t escape, then I have to Courageously face the shadow..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered the question, suddenly, he felt the sun was dark and the noisy crowd became quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is?" Downey raised his head subconsciously and saw a silver-gray aircraft floating in the air. It was so huge, equivalent to a few ordinary aircraft. Ten times, the sun is blocked, and the cold and dreamy metallic light flows. The overall shape is shuttle-shaped, elegant, and slowly descends without any jitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This large aircraft? And completely breaks through the limitations of floating and flying, its power system is definitely a miniaturized fission device!" Sami's I looked at the aircraft with great enthusiasm and made a "professional" judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most common dreams of children who grew up after the first year of the arcane calendar (the year of Viken’s Fall, 830 years of the Holy Calendar) Have an own aircraft, the alchemy vehicle running on the ground is too vulgar and too "ugly"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the journal "Aircraft" is very popular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie also loves the aircraft, slightly relieves the tension and looks into the sky, and marvels: "There must be a small fission device, at least constrained nuclear fusion." There is no news of success of the device... The Lord of the Speaker, His Excellency Evans, His Excellency Fernando, His Excellency Hathaway, Lord Ravendi, and Lord Morris have not broken the input more than the output or must have the legendary peak rating method. The difficulties of the array constraints..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is definitely no ordinary aristocrat who can afford small fission devices, even the general aristocrats don't even think..." Sami squinted. "Hey, why is there no aristocratic coat of arms? Deliberately obscured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey looked carefully: "I really don't have it, But no matter what, it must be a big man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aircraft slowly moved forward and lowered the height, and finally stopped at the unmanned square on the back side of the teaching building. On, left the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which gentleman is coming to the patrol? Is it a big man with an extraordinary background to take the unified entrance exam?" Sami regained his gaze and once again showed a languid The state, and the ghost behind him seems to blend into his body, barely visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie just wants to answer, don’t know, just see the crowd apart, a team of knights in silver-gray armor carrying a strange dark black backpack, holding a cylindrical metal The long guns, the pace of neatly passing, they faceless, temperament chill, shocked the crowd without a little noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the 'Sword of Truth' Knights!" Downey noticed that the knight's chest had a fuchsia coat of arms, a cloud-like line wrapped Holding a crown, and on both sides of the crown is a scepter symbolizing supreme majesty and a cold and indifferent sword, which is the emblem of the Hoffenberg family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami is even more surprised: "It's the 'Guardian' squad! They are carrying ultra-small fission devices!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd around him hears his words, and is quieter. The 'Guardian' squad is the elite squad of the Knights of Truth, specializing in guardian missions, although not most members have The Knights are so terrifying, but they are equipped with ultra-small fission backpacks and Gaussian rifles. The former provides abundant electrical energy and excitation medium for the latter, which greatly reduces the use requirements of high-order items such as Gaussian rifles. Among the 'Guardian' squads, even the four-level knights can use Gauss rifles several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
