			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kingdom of Holm, Pefors County, the small town of Samara. . !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Golden Moon, the night begins to creep in early, the time that belongs to the setting sun and the color of everything that has been dyed with red enamel has become dim and dull, Pefes The skirt is the bustling and prosperous place of the Holm Kingdom. The street of Samara in the small town also has a street lamp and a pole. The magic crystal lamp starts to bloom under the connection of a line of wires. The clear light, the darkness is excluded from the scope of its own cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens of the small town walked into the streets in twos and threes, walking towards the only square, the Baroque Baron Square, where there is a magical broadcast of the city hall. Whenever the night comes, it will make a "sounding voice" and deliver the radio programs such as "The Voice of Mystery" to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the increasing number of radio channels, the citizens are also caught in the troubles of choice. Although the Voice of Mystery is very good, it is their first choice, but it will not There are programs that can satisfy everyone's tastes, so everyone has a "Sound of Mystery" column that they don't like. Unfortunately, Magic Radio doesn't belong to them. There is no way to "change Taiwan" when encountering similar programs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be sure to work hard, try to save money, go to ‘Elemental Gifts, buy a magic radio!” said the young man in a blouse, Banus, with a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companion next to him is still eager to say: "I heard that in big cities like Renta, anyone who subscribes to a newspaper for a year can get magic. "The gift of the radio!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Is this much cheaper? Those who sell newspapers are not afraid of bankruptcy?" Banus is unbelievably questioning, this is A good thing I have never heard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His companion is a big boy with freckles. He took care of his hair: "I heard that these newspapers are all started by the radio itself, mainly In order to improve the coverage of magic radio, Her Majesty also signed and promulgated the "Promotion of Broadcasting Development Order" submitted by the Parliament. Every time a radio station is sent, a certain range of monetary subsidies and tax breaks can be obtained. ····”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is gradually low, so it is mysterious: "I heard that there is a magical parliament behind this. They are advertising. The form gives the station a huge subsidy, so the radio will basically not lose money..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorcerer?" Banus became excited and then suddenly realized, "Yes. The magic radio was developed by them. The more they sell, the more they naturally earn, the other book friends are watching:!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, you think Magicians who study the essence of the world will be fools? They are smarter than you. Up! "Laughed a big boy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the political meaning is concerned, they simply don’t understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus suddenly snorted: "Ali, how do you know these things? 'The voice of mystery, but nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels strange, how can a companion who is as knowledgeable as himself suddenly become a scholar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big boy Ali hooked his finger. The voice was small but very proud: "This is what someone told me, a noble lady of Rantat!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Lentat's nobility? How can you know the noble lady of Rentat!" Banus was completely shocked, to their small city. People, even if there is a "eye of mystery" to open the eyes, you can still have a heartfelt respect for the nobility of the small town, think that they are unattainable, think that their life is luxurious and enjoy, think that they are waiting for themselves People are in different worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And compared with the nobles of the capital Rantat, the nobility of the small town is nothing, if the nobles of Rantart are swans, Pephos County The nobles of the capital are white geese, and the nobility of the small town is at most ugly ducklings - the term comes from "the voice of mystery". The biggest hobby of these nobles is to chase the trend of Rentat, imitating the dress of the capital aristocracy, daily manners And entertainment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility of the small town is such a state of mind. The civilians such as Banus are naturally more serious, and in their hearts they consider themselves to be "countrysides." . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People. What is that?" The face of Banus's horse showed a blank look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell you to learn more words, you don't listen. After the establishment of the postal department, some newspapers launched an activity of writing letters and making friends, so far away. People from different cities have become friends by writing letters to each other. Because they rely on text communication alone, they are called pen pals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alibaba introduces Banus with great enthusiasm "You think about it, maybe we can't leave this small town in our life, but we are in Rentat, in Pefus, we have sincere friends in other big cities, strange and familiar friends, we have never seen each other. It’s a wonderful thing to communicate with my inner friends through words...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s intoxicated appearance, obviously like the way of this pen pal . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds great!" Banus’s mouth was wide and he was infected. He realized the importance of the text. The biggest difference with Ali is that his father used to be a clerk's entourage, so he learned the text and then taught him! And since he can only rely on Ali's occasional explanation, recognize a few words, fundamentally No way to read the newspaper! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of communication, no interest, no entanglement, no look at the other person's face, no regard for other people's identity, is the most sincere between people The way of communication.” Ali’s appearance of the “Sound of Mystery” psychological program, “So, I said before that I know from the pen pal, she is a nobleman of Renttat, has her own magic radio, can be free Listening to other channels, you can also get news from other nobles, and certainly will not lie on such things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You kid, actually hook up A noble lady!" Banus snorted Ali's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali protested: "What is hooking, we are pure pen pals!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you dare say that you have not fantasized about her? What kind of aristocratic lady is she?" Banus glared at Ali, what is your character, I don't know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali became soft: "The tone of her letter has been very gentle, she is definitely a well-educated girl, and after knowing my identity, I am also No discrimination, I have a question and answer to my question, and I will share with me the interesting things in my life... Her handwriting is slim and should be very similar to her..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Looking at Ali's demeanor, listening to her description, Banus's excitement gradually calmed down and couldn't help but say: "Ali, you have to remember that she is a nobleman, and you are just ordinary civilians."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, we are pure pen pals!" Ali waved his hand and motioned to understand, then shifted the subject and talked about "pen pals" to himself. The description of the Rantat scene is more exaggerated about the ever-changing changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big city is so good, there are so kind aristocratic ladies, there are such shocking changes..." Banus was shocked, though "the voice of mystery" I have mentioned similar changes, but due to limited time, there is absolutely no such thing as Ali said. "And, only big cities can subscribe to a newspaper for a year to send magic radio!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, I must go to Rentat!" Ali is also looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus’s brains turned and suddenly excitedly said: “Let’s go to the big city to subscribe to the newspaper, and the magic steam train fare back and forth plus one year’s newspaper Half of the magic radio will save a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, there was a similar thing happening before, so now you must have a big city citizenship to enjoy this Give away." Ali sighed bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, this is discrimination! Banus completely forgot his praise and yearning for the big city, and blurted out: "Go to your big city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two discussed while moving forward And gradually arrived at the Baroque Baron Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is the opening ceremony of the Rentata Music Festival. I don't know what the singer's voice will do," Ali said with anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banus nodded. Suddenly, he widened his eyes: "Magic, magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
