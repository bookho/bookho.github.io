			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Principality of Calais, Cox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is adjacent to the southern swamp. Even in the dead of night, the weather is extremely hot. From time to time, strange birds are worn out from the darkness, bringing a creepy cry. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The edge of the swamp, quietly looking at the old fox in the city of Cooks, Anord suddenly smiled: "Nielsen, you never thought about returning to this one day. City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he was back in the master's stance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the capital of the Arthur Empire. The foundation is the most perfect. It is the most suitable for building the puzzle that the death lord studied. It naturally became the target of this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red-eyed" Nielsen squirmed the "puffy" muscles, with a rare tone: "I thought that this life will not return to Cuxus again... ... I still remember that when I became the Ninth Ring Master, I was here to receive the "Death Lord" award."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plyhill covered up with a smile A little nervous: "I originally thought that the goal was Rantat's. I don't think it was Cux."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action is mainly the legendary magicians in the epic The knight's secret cooperation is completed, but once the church is destroyed and the city is occupied, a large number of high-ranking mages are required to maintain order, stationed everywhere, and the heavy preparations for the construction of the lock, so Ann Arnold with Nelson, Puli Wizards such as Hill, Amantata, and Fernando are waiting for signals on the edge of the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annord snorted: "The Sword of Truth is not willing to lose its own territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, why didn't you see Douglas?" Plyhill probably understood the reason, began to look left and right, did not find the Archmage who impressed himself ten years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold smiled: "Douglas said that his research has reached the most critical time, and seems to have grasped what. So I let him not participate, We are enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished speaking, he suddenly narrowed his eyes: "Begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received the "Death of the Lord" "Wind News", the legendary magicians are about to start acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground under the cover of heavy soil. The ragged "City of the Sky" is lying there as always. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is sitting on the square in the middle of the city, with a sheet of paper full of symbols and numbers in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of regularity and calculus from a large number of astronomical records made him faintly touched "a magical thing", specifically what is coming out, but always A little worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is deeply entangled in him, let him sit here for a few days, but never thought of the perfect answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret of the planet's operation. The source of the earth's power, the most essential mystery of these worlds seems to be in front of his eyes, only separated by a door, just push it open, you can see! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is almost the same! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the square, several magicians guarding the place took their children to take a walk, admire and curious about the contemplative Master, but did not dare Close to one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children run away from each other and try to get the fruits in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aalto, the fire is shining. The building collapsed and the defensive array did not seem to play a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this? Locked up?" Beto in the party couldn't believe that the church's aggressive attack came at this time, and even more unimaginable Aalto fans. The lock did not work! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who knows, at this critical moment, the lock is not actually launched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan cold a face, a little bit flustered: "The lock is not activated. There is only one explanation, that is, the legendary lord of this time guarding the lock The problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is it?" Beto, the twins, Antec and others asked in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran looked at them and snorted: "Are you stupid? The most important thing now is to escape, not to ask which legendary lord has a problem." Can you still kill him? The cardinal and the Knights of the church are in the sky above Alto. Do you still have time to ask this question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She This time I switched to the spiritual connection, while squatting at them, I ran to the basement of the villa: "Don't escape, you will be killed by the aftermath of the legendary battle, and don't go to the teacher. They must be cardinals, The epic knights are entangled. We first go out through the secret road, hide in the dark mountains, and then inquire about the news!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are the legendary students Oh, because of the lack of experience, I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. If Stanis is there, they have the backbone, but he once again entered the Dark Mountains in order to promote the legendary materials. Fortunately, Fran kept the most basic calm at this time, showed his calm side as a leader, and pointed out the best way to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec timidly shrinks and scares his legs, and he never imagined that he would face such a huge danger. He prefers to hide in the dark and manipulate dreams. Create illusions and defeat the enemy, and at this time, the huge roar of the sky challenges his soul all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a pure light descended from the sky, as if from the ruling of the gods, erasing everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light was suddenly rebounded by the "mysterious mirror" that appeared suddenly, split into several streams, one of which, unbiased, was in the villa where Fran and others were located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant light broke out, and the slight broken sound was like the raft that the judge had fallen, and the whole villa disappeared directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beto, Fran, Antec and others are only one step away from the entrance to the basement, but they are swallowed up by the aftermath of the "light of judgment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beto watched his body and soul rush into the light, and there was only one vague idea in his mind: "I am so dead?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chaotic "dark" era, even the legendary students, Beto is not sure that he will definitely live to the end of life. He once imagined his own method of death. Every death method was vigorous and without exception. After the war with the legend, he was exhausted. There is a night watchman who counts and pulls the other person to the same end, just like the protagonist in the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, he knows that he is so obscured and so understated. The aftermath of the two legendary battles directly erased themselves from the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a big deal, even a slight resistance! How similar to ordinary people who died in battle in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was just a supporting actor..." Beto's consciousness completely dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec also feels the transpiration of the body and soul in an instant, fears, fears and other emotions have finally disappeared completely, and the inner feelings are faint: "I have not made A real dream..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not so many female companions in the dream..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The appointment with Fernando will never be realized..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, he became a beautiful girl, only Biffran is worse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran is fixedly watching Beto, Antec, and the enemies are swallowed up by the Holy Light, and the light of the resurrection is flashing. Another road was overwhelmed, and I understood very well that I was exactly the same as them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not willing. I am not willing to die here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
