Hamm subconsciously repeated it, only to remember that he had ordered a nearby famous honey-roasted fish to comfort himself. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the food in the Holm Kingdom is boring, it is unbearable for foodies, but it refers to long-term consumption, if only lived here for a short time. The grilled fish of different flavors is also a good experience. For example, the honey-roasted fish on the Landauer Street is famous. Every traveler who comes to Rentat will go to taste it. Hamm is no exception, but only He has a mission and is not convenient to go out. He can only order through the wired telephone in the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the identity of the outside knocker, Hamm relaxed a lot, and the magic of the exercise was slightly swept away, seeing only a young service outside. Health, so he went to the door and was ready to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., please open the door, the honey you want is grilled." Hey, the waiter outside seems to feel that the title was not polite, re Knocked at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What anxious..." This is a unique feature of the Holm Kingdom. Hamm never encountered similar things in the Kingdom of Dumte. Shake his head and shake his head - the wired telephone order is currently only carried out in the most popular promotion of Rentat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, the smell of honey-baked fish sneaked into Ham's nose, and when he spit out, it suddenly burst out of the corner. Two faint shadows, one that seemed to drive the shadows around Ham's legs, and a darkness shrouded Hamm's upper body, making it impossible for him to see the surrounding scenes, and it was difficult to hear the subtle movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy attack!" Hamm was shocked and angry, and he opened the door to collect the honey-baked fish, and he would encounter an enemy attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His muscles began to bulge, a faint violent red glow in his eyes, and the bare skin shone through the black and black color, violently, Freed the bondage of the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the dwarfs is good at making machinery, and the corresponding strength will be a little bigger. Besides, there is no special place, so the dark night plateau Gusdu and other short-term talents could not stimulate blood power like humans. However, the part of the dwarf who did not hide in the night plateau was conservatively destroyed during the ancient magical empire. It also became an experimental product of blood transformation, and it was a fusion of barbarism. After a lot of blood, such as people, swamp gnomes, and so on, the dwarf blood variability has become a fairly powerful blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stimulating the blood, the dwarf's strength and physical defense will be comparable to those of the same level barbarian, as well as violent ability, and can also display several illusion fields. The spells of the class, and Hamm is a samurai who inspires the blood and has a blessing of the magical brace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power broke out, the shadows collapsed, Hamm was about to flash aside, avoiding subsequent attacks, and using magic to dispel the darkness that enveloped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but at this moment, the young waiter who stood opposite him, lifted the plate with the grilled fish, slammed it, and slammed it On Ham's head, the speed is so fast that he can't escape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plate doesn’t know what material it is made of, but Hamm’s dizziness is dazzling, countless golden stars shine, his head creaks, and grilled fish The scent of soft fish mixed down from the head, crossed Hamd's eyes, nose, and entered his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Ham finally tasted the long-awaited honey-roasted fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste is really good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brain is dull, the shadows are re-rolling, and another sneak attacker once again casts magical magic, and soon disintegrates Hamm’s defense. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the stairs, the senior police detective of the Rantat Police Department looked at the fierce but not scattered battle here, looking at the three kingdom intelligence departments. The strongman pressed Hamm to the ground and put on the bracelet and collar that impeded the blood and the power of the gods. He laughed and said to himself: "I dare to play the dwarf's idea. Do you know that they are the objects of close attention of the kingdom? When you first came into contact with Harold, you were stared at by the intelligence personnel. Oh, you still want to eat honey-roasted fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was ordered to cooperate with intelligence personnel, So as not to hurt the ordinary people nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the parliament, Lucien’s dwarf on the bright side did not involve God’s surname, and it was a beautiful misunderstanding of the dwarf. It was not a communication of faith, and Wang Guozhong confirmed this from the mouth of Lucien. Natasha told the intelligence personnel to pay close attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ham was taken away by the intelligence personnel, Buck also quietly evacuated, the action ended very quickly, did not cause a big movement, the ordinary passengers in the next room did not even I noticed that there was a secret arrest operation here, and I was still muttering: "Honey grilled fish... smells very good, I also ordered one by phone..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret intelligence department of the Holm Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basement, Natasha, who received the report, decided to interrogate herself. She suspected that this matter was related to the secret of Vikken’s secret communication god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s a simple beige safari, surrounded by her hands, standing at Hamm’s present, repeating the information she just got: “The goddess of craftsman, Heite, once a year The Xia Wei Festival defeated the heroic god Okun. After Okun admitted that Hite was the embodiment of the god of steam and worshipped him as the dwarf god, Hite also took the opportunity to announce his 'identity' and sent messengers to Other tribal dwarves scattered throughout the mainland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, mainly focused on the devout Rentat dwarf, playing the pseudonym that could not be given to the gods The idea of ​​the god of steam... Hey, Okun is probably not the original Okun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is not dignified, but with a touch of teasing, it seems This is not a sacred and solemn event, but a farce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various pseudo-god churches that rose in the early days of the Twilight War were not low in strength, unlike the false gods of the alien space, the deities of their sects often Legendary level of strength, such as the earth goddess, such as the dark master, such as the god of heroism and the god of craftsmen, about eight legendary levels of false gods. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why they are not limited by the name of God like El God, they are influenced by the power of many beliefs that are aggregated, and are “there are countless different consciousnesses revealed by the latest research” To confuse her own consciousness and soul, the Magic Council did not understand the reason, but after discovering the secrets of ancient magicians such as Tanos, Viken, and Maskillin, they almost understood what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should be the product of the magicians such as MacLeod’s study of the gods, not directly integrating themselves with the “force of faith”, but first refining the special god The artifacts replace themselves, and finally merge with themselves, and the hidden dangers are relatively less obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ham is one meter high, shaking his dizzy head, looking at Natasha in front of him, his heart full of fear, he insisted on faith, refused Revealing a half sentence, but the woman who is more horrible than the gods and dragons came in, and when she was seen by her silver-purple eyes, she fell into a state of extreme panic, like being stirred by a knife from the beginning of the soul. Cut it, so I revealed everything I knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is tall, Hamm tries to look up at her face, angry and said: "You have married the great steam god, you will be "The gods punished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like to hear people call the god of steam, so please tell Hite and ask him to change his name, otherwise he will probably There is no name, because the dead, no, the dead god does not need a name." Natasha said half-jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Ham’s body burst into a pale gold light, and the heart of faith swallowed him and turned into a whirlpool of golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent voice came out of this whirlpool: "You offended me and made me angry!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences are very serious... Natasha is immersed in Lucien’s enthusiasm, silently filled in the sentence, secretly laughed, actually came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex instantly becomes transparent, and it is faint to see a dwarf wearing a golden sacred armor with a silver-white giant hammer that exudes a vast taste. The top is covered with dense patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take the trial!" Hite screamed with a silver-white giant hammer, turning the golden swirl into the same shape and slamming it into Nata. Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
