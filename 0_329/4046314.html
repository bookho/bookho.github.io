			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the month of enthusiasm (June) is not too hot, cool breeze, bringing refreshing meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of John’s house, this cool but deserted, with a bit of ice into the bone marrow, makes you feel heavy sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa made of mahogany, the family of four seemed to be silent, and there was no feeling of communication, as if they were caught in the memories of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alissa from time to time with a handkerchief to wipe the tears from the darkness; Ai Wenqing’s face is gloomy, thinking of hate, the fists are tightly held Joel had a good drink in his right hand and occasionally took a sip, but the biggest hobby besides music couldn’t make his brow spread a little; John was quiet, with no joy or distortion, left hand The glass of wine is not seen at all, as if it were a stone statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, when people are old, they become soft and unable to accept the passing of life. When I was in Adejan, I personally sent away my good friends." There are so many neighbors, but they have all recovered in a few days, and they are full of enthusiasm for life, such as when Evans died of illness, hehe." Joel sighed self-consciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adejan district is a slum where there are many unconventional ordinary people living there, and there are many men who simply rely on their strength to support their families, so they suddenly fall ill There are so many people who can't climb anymore, and the death rate is the highest place in the whole of Alto. From here, Joel’s family is used to seeing death and separation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza glanced at Joel and cried: "How can they compare with Little Evans, he is so young, even twenty I didn’t have a year old, but I was so talented, noble, and hard-working. I was the best and best musician. Hey, he still has no wife, no children, and the blood of Evans’s family is cut off.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years of aristocratic life, she talked a lot more elegantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, if there is no such accident, we will be able to participate in the wedding of Little Evans in about half a year." Joel sighed again. The concert, the performance of Natasha at the funeral, and the sneaking date of the two in the middle of the night made him believe that as long as the Grand Duke did not oppose, the two young people who were obviously caught in the hot love would certainly not be able to step into the wedding hall. And does the Grand Council oppose the normal marriage of His Royal Highness? Obviously not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of pity makes the hall silent again, then John stands up and calmly comforts: "Dad, Mom, you have a rest early, Lucien is in heaven." Shan certainly doesn't want you to get sick because of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, since Little John said so, then we will go back upstairs to sleep." Joe He got up and patted John's shoulder and sighed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John, who has become a jazz, is the backbone of the whole family. His comfort is very useful, so Eliza puts away her tears and swears at him: "Little John You should rest early, don't squander your knight's body. When patrolling near the dark mountain fortress, your body is a little stronger and safer, there are many evil dark creatures and magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fears that these other noble ladies instilled in her, she did not care much, but this time Lucien? Evans was murdered by the evil wizard "Professor", which made her really pay attention to this matter, worried about her eldest son, the Dark Mountain fortress is more dangerous than Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the word magician, John’s hands had a slight invisible trembling, then he hugged Alisa: "Mom, you can rest assured, I will pay attention to myself. Only by strictly demanding myself, not indulging, I can become a second-level knight, and hopefully promote the Cavaliers within ten years. This will be better able to fight evil, fight the damn devil, demon and magic. Teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, John couldn’t help but curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the cool breeze blowing in from the open window suddenly became a lot bigger and creaking, like countless ghosts crying and crying. The outside became gloomy and the moonlight disappeared. If it weren't for the faint yellow light on the brass candlesticks in the hall, it might be dark and might not reach the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" John sensed a little bit of magical volatility from the wind, and noticed that someone was slowly walking down the stairs, so he stepped forward and pulled out The super-long sword placed on the coffee table was firmly in front of Joel, Eliza and Ai Wen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with his experienced and powerful brother, Ai Wen, who had only been trained for the Cavaliers for a few years, was very blue. It was not until John broke his drink that he returned to God. It took a lot of time to find his own sword. Work, hard to get a sweaty sword to protect the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hall was very quiet. John’s drink didn’t provoke any reaction. Only the stairs were filled with crisp and loud footsteps. Hey, it’s like stepping on it. Above the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza grips Joel’s sleeves with fear, and Joel looks worriedly at John and Avon, both himself and his wife. Ten years old, and a few years of comfortable living, even if you die, there is no regret, but the sons are still so young, there should be a better future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who? Who?!" John did not give up and asked, the strong will made his mood change from nervous to calm. This is a good area in the aristocratic area. There are many knights, big knights, and even some knights in some of the big aristocrats. Together with the patrolling night watchman, the longer the time drags on, the better it is for your family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little dim candlelight appeared at the corner of the stairway, and John stared at it and suddenly blurted out:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Lu Xien?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black dress, a bow tie, and a silver candlestick slowly coming down the stairs. Lusien, who has passed away? Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Evans?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Evans?!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xi'an Big Brother?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, and Ai Wen also saw it clearly. The face of the person, under the candlelight, the familiar handsome face is heavy and quiet, and the complexion is white but not pale, full of life brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me, Uncle Joel, Eliza, John, Avon." Lucien tried to make herself smile, which helped to ease the atmosphere, but I can't laugh at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alysa exclaimed: "Little Evans, you get the permission of the Lord, come to visit us last time before entering the Mountain of Heaven?" Vaoli Growing up in the Principality, she naturally attributed everything she could not understand and could not explain to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the excitement, she seems to want to pounce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mom, be careful, you are not Lucien! It is an evil magician who has become Lucy's look to play with us!" John stopped The impulse of Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the curse of Lucien’s undisguised mentality, he can only defend himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John, you said that half of the right half is wrong. I am indeed Lucien Evans, but also a magician. I am Not dying, but taking the opportunity to get rid of the musician's identity." Lucian stopped on the last step of the stairs, because Joel, Alisa and Avon heard the words of John, panic, hatred, Subconsciously retreating, trying to pull away the distance, and John is very vigilant and alert, it seems that the sword will be thrown out at any time, so it is good for everyone to maintain a suitable distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of cognition makes Lucien's mood worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien is a magician, fake death?" John repeated it, his face was angry: "Bastard, you damn bastard, you damn it." The magician, after killing Lucien, also smashed his reputation! He has been interrogated by the referee, he is devoted to music, is devout, tenacious, tenacious, cheerful, optimistic, A pure good man, how could it be a magician?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of adjectives set the image of his inner Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel and others who were a little hesitant and awkward were once again infected by John’s resoluteness and hate Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John continues: "I am a knight, don't I know that the magician has a deformed spell, and you become Lucien's look to smash him. What is it for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John's eyes became amazed, but he quickly sighed: "What is the use of these things? There are a lot of magical means for you to know these things from Lucien's mouth!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has always appreciated the knight’s firm will, but today he has a headache, and the most important thing is that he is not clear about the bits and pieces before crossing. It is easy to continue to rely on the details. "Prove" yourself as a fake, so I have to say: "John, you should be very clear, these little things are difficult to ask every detail by magic, unless it is a nine-ring magic attack on the mind. You can use any of this thing Ask me in a tiny place to confirm my identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John’s expression is dignified and full of struggle and disgust, Joel, Eliza, Evan It is hateful and disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing John didn’t ask, Lucien asked himself from the ground up: “I didn’t really learn magic after I knew the witch, so I could withstand the torture of the referee. But when Pastor Benjamin asked me and a few knights to deal with the Witchcraft Lab, I got a book and notes backed up by the witch cautiously, and embarked on the path of magic."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Joel, Eliza, John, do you remember why I suddenly wanted to learn words? That's because only learning words can read magic notes and books!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John, do you know why I can find the conspiracy of the Silver Point? That's because I practice magic in the sewer!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The details of the recall and the problems under the cover of the details were revealed by Lucien. The strict logic and other confirmations made John’s face violently shaken. He was paradoxically low-lying. One sentence: "Lu Xien, why do you want me to believe? Believe The friend was a magician playing with the good people of the city magician "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;?? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; in his mind, it seems that Lucien's image was completely destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliza refuses to believe her head, and the child she loves and often gets along with is actually the evil magician in the church propaganda, and if it is a fake thing It’s true, it’s really evil... Joel stares at Lucien’s eyes and sees the pain in his eyes. The disgust on his face has eased a few points: “Little Evans, you’re forced to choose magic at first. Why do you continue to pursue the path of magic after you show such outstanding musical talents? Are you so eager for power that you want to turn your back on the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Uncle Joel, this is not the case. I chase magic because I love it deeply, I want to penetrate the truth of this world. What is our life, why can this world exist, in what form, why is the starry sky above it? The mysterious and other questions and their unknown answers are the most beautiful and attractive, full of the ultimate charm." Lucian answered from the heart, then looked at John, "John, I am a fake because of the magician I will be exposed sooner or later. In this case, it is better to let your favorite musicians live in their hearts forever. I am sorry for the things that make them sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After I became a magician, I have never taken the initiative to hurt any innocent person except for self-protection and saving people. Whether you can accept the identity of my magician, I hope you can understand that I am not the evil magician. And most of the magicians in the Magic Council are not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John's face eased a bit: "Lu Xien, why are you still appearing in us? In front of us, don't worry about us selling you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that their emotions have eased a bit, Lucien stepped forward, but John, Joel, Alisa, Ai Wen is subconsciously taking a step back, fearing that fear still exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, Lucien smiled and shook his head: "Uncle Joel, Eliza, John, Avon, I am coming back to ask you Would you like to follow me to the Kingdom of Holm, where there are many magicians, but there are still churches and nobles, but everyone gets along very peacefully, and I am sure that the nobility of the Holm kingdom will accept you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hol Kingdom? Magical Parliament Headquarters? His Royal Highness Princess?" John seemed to think of something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head again: "This time has nothing to do with Natasha, it was my teacher 'professor' and I planned it. I have seen you. I will go see her, explain the facts to her, and hope to get her forgiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
