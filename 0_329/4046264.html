			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being stunned, Leo, who was stunned by the blood of the "Greek Giant", did not faint. Leo opened his eyes after hearing the words of Lucien. Unbelievable surprises, uncontrollable ecstasy and intractable fears have become a complex look. Is this young gentleman capable of coping with Warren and his father? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner didn’t expect Lucien to ask so directly and with similar instructions. Doesn’t he know who Warren is, and who is his father? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahaha, Warren felt very ridiculously laughing twice, reluctantly restrained the anger, and said happily: "This gentleman, why should I let you first? Hire Leo? Do you think that he will be stupid enough to return to the East in exile after he left with you? Don't you think that your tone is very hateful? Do you think you can take my anger instead of him?!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sentence of reflexive question fully exposed Warren’s bad mood at this time, and a business that pleased a Duke of the Shahran Empire was destroyed by Leo, and he finally caught him ready. Venting anger, but also came up with an inexplicable guy trying to stop. I originally intended to maintain basic courtesy and sinful ignorance of the mysterious stranger's way of doing things. As a result, his tone was calm and indifferent, as if he was commanding his own, except for his father, nine city owners and the Shahran Empire. Noble, no one dares to speak with himself in this tone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Warren’s tone changing, the short and fierce Alolim stepped forward, holding a pair of black daggers in his hands, making a forthcoming Look, the Cavaliers' momentum is unreservedly directed at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once Lucian was suppressed, even shivering, indicating that his strength is not strong, then you can directly take him down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a preliminary temptation. Warren can't let a guy pretend to be an unpredictable look. He will shock himself if he says two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yalolim's icy gray eyes stared at Lucian's eyes, pressing his will to the full force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw the grayish light of Lucien’s brown pupil flashing away, as if with an old decaying breath into his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, extreme itch and pain emerged on Arollim without warning, and it was difficult for him to be opposite the tavern behind Lucerne. Resentful screams, because they saw the back of Arromim's hand, the skin of the face was festered, and the yellowish pus leaked out, and it was extremely horrified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arolim knew that he had the magic of Lucien, and the body immediately turned into a layer of black flame, but the fester seemed to infect even the illusory flame. The blossoming flames turn yellow and extinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren, another tall and tall man next to him and other black scales swordsmen also noticed the horror of Arollim, just a few seconds At the time, Arolim was as weak as a person, and finally resisted the fester of the whole body, gasping with a big mouth, but he wanted to get better, I am afraid it will take a long time, and the road Sean still put his hands in the black double-breasted long dress pocket, smiling at this scene, no downtime attack, and did not try to deepen its ulceration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Rings Necromancer Magic "Frozen Curse"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Necromancer?" Warren tried to calmly ask, but his voice was still a little scared, and the reputation of the Necromancers was never good. All kinds of cruel, mysterious, dark, and horrible means seem to be the portrayal of them and the illusionist, especially in the depths of the northern land where many ancient inheritance magicians appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughs without saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other tall and strong knight bowed his head and whispered a few words in Warren’s ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren’s face rose up and down and asked: “It’s a mid-level magician. Don’t you know that you are from the Magic Council or other places in the North? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tavern owner, black scales swordsman and other guests are all looking at Lucian, no wonder he can easily solve the official knight of Arollim." It turned out to be a mid-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t look at the middle-level magician’s title, which is commonplace, can be found everywhere in the Magic Council headquarters, but it’s called the Grand Knight, called the Bishop. In addition to the holy city of Lance, the city of the sky, Allinge, Rantat, Aalto, Tria, St. Ivan, and many other places, these are the characters who can host a city, except for the nine exiles. The city master is the strongman of the heavenly knight, the golden knight, and the high-level magician. The remaining twenty or thirty lords are just the ranks of the great knight or the middle magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien wears white gloves to cover the right hand of Holm's crown ring and pushes the monocle. It is still a plain tone: "I don't matter where I am from. The important thing is that I want to take Leo. Don't you know Mr. Warren, do you agree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrogant attitude makes Warren think of the geniuses of the Magic Council, especially the pale The few hands of the hand, the heart of the electric turn, he squeezed a smile, spread the spreader: "In the east exile, either gold, or strength, since you show the power, then let me take the lead in advance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While even the father’s blessing, Warren, who can develop a great cause in the East, is naturally very aware of the rules here. Unable to contend, even if the mover out of the father may not be useful to the strong, scorpion scorpion Zhang can immediately become polite and humble, know how to give back - blindly offended a strong parliamentary background strong and was killed on the spot, except his father, East Conference of exiled lords Others may not be an idiot to waste their strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiles come out: "Mr. Warren, you are wise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that Lucien hates this kind of trafficker, but if there is no excuse to attack Warren, it is the face of the conference of the Lord’s exile in the East, and he is within the control of the East, but also Start a more dangerous journey, so you can only use the arrogant and ironic tone to try to anger Warren and let him start first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren swallowed his mouth, and he smiled and left his right hand and left with his left chest. He said nothing, he was afraid that he would endure with an opening. Can not help the tyranny in the heart, ordered to attack Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rest of the guards, several scales swordsmen supported Arollim, and the armor made a good-looking collision and walked toward the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Warren, the loss of the Taran Tavern, I will make a list for you, I hope you will fully compensate, or else you will go to the lord meeting to decide!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub owner said aloud, so that Warren, who had just passed the threshold, almost fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the room behind the pub, Lexie, who was swayed by the black flame, was slowed down by the mighty life of the quasi-chief. Come over, after all, he was not suffering from any serious physical surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of recovery, Leo saw the hard and rugged sound in the opposite side of Lucien, and a little bit of fire-flying light in his hand passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of magical fluctuations, Lucien’s mouth was silently opened and everything was restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. What are you doing? Is there a place for me to help?" Leo thanked for the help and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Nothing, be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lucien didn't say that the adventure-experienced Leo didn't ask again, but instead asked about the employment: "Mr., don't know what to call you? What are you going to hire me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can call me Mr. X for the time being, I want to hire you to take me across the Shahran Empire and reach the northeastern region of the Dark Mountains." Lucy replied in a concise manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the Shahran Empire, I remembered my grief, Leo wrinkled the golden brow: "Mr. X, I bring you into Shahran The empire is not difficult. The question is where do you want to go? So I can arrange the route and prepare the appropriate fake identity. Well, if you are not at ease, we will sign the magic contract first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; did not ask for the contents of the employment, Leo decided to accept, because without the help of Lucien, he has already died in the mouth of the wild dog, do not mention anything like revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no sentimentality, and has come up with a magic contract that has already been prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the signing of the two parties, the brown parchment was burnt down by the light blue flame, Leo knew the full name of Lucien, but he still obeyed The name of the land: "Mr. X, the Shahran Empire is a very decaying country of the aristocracy. Apart from them and the clergy, other scholars, citizens, the poor, and the serfs want to cross the empire without hindrance. It is very difficult. From the several routes to Arto, the nobility of the northwestern provinces of the Shahran Empire is the least dangerous. They rarely come to these areas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
