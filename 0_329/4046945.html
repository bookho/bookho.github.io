			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright light shone from the ceiling, and the pale white walls were cold and clean. Alvin wore loose clothing with blue and white vertical stripes and carefully walked to the door. On the side, looking through the small window above to the corridor, the expression is full of vigilance and alertness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing only people wearing similar clothes in the hallway or walking or walking around, Alvin’s eyes flashed and turned to another bed in the room. On the side, gently patted the sleeping man above, whispering: "Clement! Clement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is reflective Shrinking backwards, a pair of eyes like a burning flame watched Alvin: "You, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He speaks like a toddler Unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clement, don't pretend, no one is watching outside, we should discuss how to get out of here and how to restore strength. Alvin sincerely and eagerly looked at the companion in front of him, behind a pair of white wings protruding from the special cracks in the clothes, unfolding in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the flames of the eyes showed a bit of disgust, and his tongue was unclear: "I, I am not Clement, I have said many times! They They told me that I was Mike, MacLeod, a good, a great magician, a great alchemist, a man destined to make a miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that because he repeatedly said too much, his last half of the sentence is more fluent than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Alvin was surprised and angry. "You are not pretending? How can you forget your noble and sacred identity! We are the angels of the Lord." It is the life closest to the true God! It is the noble who can destroy and save the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has difficulty controlling his voice for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who claims to be MacLeod is scared by such a snoring, curled up like a child to the corner of the bed: "I, I don't talk to you, you are bad." "Bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin looked at the mature and handsome angel to reveal the expression of "the childish child", and it was difficult to cover up the disappointment and shook his head in grief: " You, you really forgot, how can it become like this, is it that only I still remember the Lord, remember the glory of the past, and still want to return to the paradise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you say the more sad, Alvin pushes open the door, enters the corridor, and walks back and forth to relieve the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not pay attention to those who are not familiar with the surrounding, this is the pride of the angel. He tried to escape from the place where he was imprisoned, and he was sealed by the power of terror and unimaginable power. He was easily captured by the guarded magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a blond man who was also wearing blue and white vertical striped loose clothing came over and looked around with vigilance, screaming and whispering The ground said to Alvin: "God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin’s heart glimpsed, then ecstasy, they still remember the Lord? They are the devout believers of the Lord who are captured by the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he nodded lightly, answering the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s right hand pointed out inconspicuously and motioned to follow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin observed the surroundings, as the man arrived in another room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the Lord?" Alvin closed the door and asked with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha!" The blond man faded his cautious expression, his hands on his hips and laughed. "I always believe that there are still people who remember me, I am a true God. Control the heavens and the earth, I will pass on my way to you today!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin looked at him blankly, then angered into his heart: "A madman ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was physically strong, pushing the man to the wall and then back to the corridor, inexplicably sad, sad and sad: "Lord, have they forgotten you, will your miracles never come to the earth again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also wearing blue and white vertical striped clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember the Lord?" Alvin asked casually without hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man looked at the left and right with fear, very whispered: "Remember, I am the devotee of the Lord, I was caught here, tortured me a big secret, Oh, don't look at me like this, the evil magicians are hiding around to observe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is trembling more and more, as if he just walked out of this corner, It will be caught and tortured by the magician immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really remember?" Alvin asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man solemnly painted the cross on his chest: "On the truth forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin I only felt a mist in my eyes, and I painted the cross in an sacred and solemn manner: "May your way be on the ground as if you were walking in your country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The black man waved to Alvin in the past: "Since we are all devout believers, then I will tell you the big secret, you will find a way to escape, and then come to save me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin slammed into the dark man and whispered: "Is it going to be heard by the magician?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The black-haired man smiled smugly: "This corner has been set by me to be the strongest and most powerful lock in the whole world. It is the safest place, so I am hiding here!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin looked at the empty surroundings, how can I not feel the existence of the lock? Being sealed with power is not equal to my talent ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man ignored him and put his mouth in his ear: "I will tell you that secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." Alvin didn't have time to think about the things that were locked up, and listened to the secrets with all his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of a dark-haired man is very low: "Actually, I am actually the god of truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;啊? Alvin looked at him with a stunned look, and the expression of the dark man became pity and sacred: "I am on the ground to save this filthy world. You are the first mortal to know my identity. I am sealing you for me." Angel..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, two men in black magic robe walked over, grabbed the dark man and dragged him forward square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly think of ways to escape, and then come to save me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be Self-mutilation on the cross, redeem this filthy world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin is still stunned, and one of the magicians casts a spell, silences the dark man, cold and authentic "It’s time to take medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The madman, here is a madman!" Alvin said with sorrow and anger, "The damn magician actually put Our holy angels are locked up with a group of madmen! It’s too damn! Too embarrassing!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, two other magicians arrived, holding Al Text: "Ms. Rachel wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin is not struggling because he knows that it is useless to struggle again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking, he accidentally kicked a man lying on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same man wearing the blue and white vertical stripes clothing did not say anything, trying to stay the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry." Alvin demeanor a good apology, and the man did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Alvin was puzzled, the magician next to him whispered: "Don't care for him, the body will not speak without feeling pain." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a dead spirit?" Alvin felt that he was not at all, obviously a living person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
