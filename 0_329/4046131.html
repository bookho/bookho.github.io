			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha ignored Verdi, just looking at Sylvia, who was walking alongside Verdi, his eyes slightly picked up and gloomy bite After biting the mouth, then I was bitter and angry. Q: "Is it really you? What are you doing? Is it a lie that you said to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verdi saw Natasha, except for a little exhaustion and sorrow, and did not suffer any injuries. She knew that her strength was well preserved, and that the former knight and the high-ranking magician ambushed, Natasha’s entourage had a remnant. The four-level Cavaliers, the two second-level knights, and the two official knights are a force that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, there is no rash command to loyal to their own knights to attack, and they are prepared to strike the spirit of Natasha first, and to the greatest extent Her strength, and disintegration and policy against the remaining knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the more than 20 knights around Natasha, seventy or eighty soldiers, Verdi did not care at all, the official knight may still have a bit Fear of the standard devil's longbow in the hands of the attendants, but they are not afraid of themselves and the other five great knights. This is the absolute suppression of the strength of the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia took a deep breath, and the soft and painful expression gradually calmed down: "I appreciate your love for me, Natasha. But I I love my father more, he has no contact with the Magic Council, and hopes to get rid of the life of suppressing fear. I have to do something for him. I thought they inquired about your intelligence for the secrets or other secrets of Latash Palace. I didn't expect their purpose to be assassinating you. But things have become like this, my father died under your rifle, I can only forget everything else and avenge him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Magic Council? Droni has been killed by Natasha? A lot of questions emerged in Lucine's heart, and then wake up: "Difficulty Ronnie and Sylvia are also magicians? Have you ever seen them in the magic circle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully examining Sylvia's height and distinguishing her voice characteristics, Lucien finally connected her with the magic apprentice white honey: "Nardoni is the owner of the black crow Ashley. No wonder I feel a little familiar! No wonder when I pretend to be a professor, the first one to test me is Droni!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that Natasha’s mother passed away. Why did the Magic Council cooperate with Verdi to assassinate Natasha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just grateful for my love? Sylvia, you didn't say that before. Maybe I have been living in false lies, you are lying to me, my dear cousin is also lying to me.” Natasha was keenly aware of Sylvia’s rhetoric and asked with a slight anger, but she No regrets, killing Drony in the first place, or not only yourself, including Camille. Knight died in the ambush will follow in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was quite pitiful and sympathetic to Natasha, but after hearing her words, she couldn’t help but twitch: "I seem to lie to her... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia strives to remain calm: "Gorgeous and spacious villas, exquisite and delicious food, careful professional maids, a bright future musician life, Elegant and happy aristocratic salons and banquets, these other people's dreams to get a life for me, but not as good as learning magic, not as good as the satisfaction of the experimental success, can not compare with the father's wish. Tasha, the road of life is like two cross lines, we have met together, but will eventually go further and further."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Lucy En feels the same with Silvia's words, understands that it can't be the kind of oppression of learning magic, but she is probably one of the objects that she betrayed. The world is really wonderful. Even if he now shows the identity of the magician, I am afraid that it will be killed directly by Verdi because he has nothing to do with the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And before Natasha spoke, Verdi suddenly reached out and ignored Sylvia’s resistance, holding her waist: "As for love, dear The cousin, although you are strong, determined, brave and free, but you are still a woman, there is no way to give Sylvia the love you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha closed her eyes and then laughed. She was bright and splendid, and buried all the sadness, softness and sorrow of her face: "It’s an admirable magician. I have never realized Sylvia before. Such a persistent side, probably I have never walked into your heart. Hehe, Verdi cousin, I seem to never really understand you, for the grand prince, you dare to go with the magic parliament, the silver corner The cult colludes. Do you think the main church of Sald is crowning you? The Inquisition is your affiliation! You still don't understand that you are tempted by the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;As a strong and powerful knight, Natasha did not go through the problems of love and betrayal. She asked Verdi directly and wanted the knight who followed him to understand the end of everything they did and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing deals with the devil and trading with the magician are all charges of being on fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildihaha laughed: "The temptation of the devil? If I didn't want it, why did it seduce me! Why can Dagong inherit the title, my father? Why is it that the unclear death is also the temptation of the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And when did I collude with the devil believers? I am the hero of the fight against the silver horn Without my key intelligence, how could the Sir Bilder and the Earl of Hayward destroy the final action of the Silver White in time and destroy them all? How could it be too late to rescue the cousin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And as long as you kill you, Mr. Rogerio of the Magic Council will handle the scene and point all the clues to the Magic Council. The Magic Council will also announce the charge. I am only It’s late for rescue!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It seems that Verdi’s cousin has only used the silver horn from the beginning, and now he has not hesitated to betray them. Natasha calmed down completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even after hearing this conversation, more than 20 knights and hundreds of knights who followed Verdi were expressionless, without any emotion fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was slightly surprised, carefully looked around the knight surrounded, and found a familiar shape of Longsang? Aaron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildi sneered aloud: "If it wasn't for your side, Lucien? Mr. Evans betrayed the silver horn, I probably succeeded. But This is also good, the momentary victory makes you blindfolded, let you think that there is no more spy around, let you trust Sylvia, and walk into my ambush without warning."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha picked a purple eyebrow: "So when Mr. Victor was in concert, you were actually deliberately in my language, and I was inspired to invite Lucien as a music consultant?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear cousin, I’m glad you realize that you are not that smart." Will's many years of plots are about to succeed, it seems a bit proud, and time is dragging on For a while, maybe Rogerio and Magma can solve Camille, so he looks at Lucien: "You declare that the enemy will never compromise. I know from Sylvia." I appreciate it very much, but unfortunately you betrayed the silver horn, destroying my plan. Originally, if you didn't go to Lake Elsinore and was killed by the Silver Horn, I would send someone to kill you, but you actually hit Natasha and let me save a lot of things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s sorrow is what the risk that Maskillin is referring to, because Sylvia’s betrayal, his “moonlight” and the betrayal of the silver horn have long been It’s not a secret, but Verdi and the Silver White are afraid of revenge and the Joel family’s surprise Natasha and the church, so that the final plan fails, they have been forbearing, and they are “grand hospitality” after preparing for the success of the event: Ok, they don't know my 'professor' status..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you Lord Earl, you make me know that I am not as safe as I imagined." Sean smiled calmly, and Droni’s poetry and scattered manuscripts should only be tempted by the way. After all, it’s hard to say how much magical relics are to a quasi-knight. The real danger is the chasing after Verdi’s aftermath. And now just push the danger ahead . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien touched the gap between the surrounding dead world and the main material world through the hustle and bustle, which is the best shortcut to escape the encirclement, but let The sad thing is that the previous gap has completely disappeared with the collapse of the lock, and there is no more within the scope of the induction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your calm is really admirable." Verdi converges, looking seriously at the knights behind Natasha: "Wain Knight, you guys Will you still follow Natasha? The lord of the Northern Fortress, the two golden knights of the Dark Mountain Fortress, and the Haien family and the Hill family all suggest neutrality. As long as I can kill Natasha, they will admit it. I am the future grandfather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is said, not only the knights, knight attendants and soldiers behind Natasha are all stunned, even Natasha himself Also a little can't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well saw that the effect was good, continued: "The reason they made this choice is because a female horse with a strange name and a woman likes them. Disgust and worry! Natasha insults the spirit of the knight, and there is no way to ensure the continuation of the descendants of the blood. Do you feel glory with Natasha?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
