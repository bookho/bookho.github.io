			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere inside the carriage became very weird, and Douglas seemed to have forgotten the two magicians on the side, whispering one strange question after another. Fernando and Roland don't know what to say. Isn't this just the same thing as the rising sun and the ripeness of the land? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Douglas quickly got rid of this state and apologized apologetically: "Sorry, I always have similar disappointments."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I often do this when I encounter magic problems." Roland smiled and seemed to be completely uninterested in Douglas's strange problem. Fernando opened his mouth, but still did not sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short silence disappeared, and Fernando and Roland introduced Douglas to the situation on the Strait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it is the Hillanas Empire or the Yasso Empire, the forces here have collapsed and become one after another, scattered and unrelated The organization, some even escaped to the endless ocean, it can be said that the situation here is not even as good as the strait, at least the western territory of Aalto is still in the hands of the magician..." Roland half sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando added: "The territory originally belonging to the Assault Empire was divided into two parts, one is the Kingdom of Burriana, the other is the Principality of Calais, Hill. The area to which the Fanas Empire belongs is the Kingdom of Holm and the Kingdom of Colette. The main event of our organization is in the Kingdom of Holm, where we are now..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas had heard about this before crossing the Stormwind Strait. It was no stranger to the two, but not so detailed. His face was a bit stunned first, and then reappeared with a calm and peaceful smile: "In fact, I chose to cross the stormy strait instead of fleeing to Aalto, because I am more optimistic about the situation here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Fernando is unrecognizable on the surface, but his eyes are slightly lifted, and the bright red pupils are not allowed to reveal their emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the analysis of the situation, the "joint union" has been doing it internally, and the final conclusion is similar to Douglas, so there are previous attempts and changes in direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas said calmly: "Because the overall strength of the nobility here is stronger than the Church of Truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This sentence is like lightning, hitting Roland. Let him be numb. Suddenly, I understand why the organization will change its strategy before it hides, evades the pursuit of killing, and grows up. Boldly let Fernando come to the capital of Pefors to see the biggest aristocrat here - the name of the county. The power of Count Pefus is evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that this is to draw the nobility. Provoke their relationship with the church in exchange for their blessings to escape the increasingly strict pursuit of the church. But it has never been so clear and thorough to understand why this is done and what ideal results may develop in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando said nothing, just watching Douglas quietly, waiting for his next words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We don't know the specific situation here, but according to my observation, with the fall of Antiefler, the clerics are more and more arrogant towards the nobility. And most of the cardinals and sacred knights are concentrated in Antilles and Lance, ready to go west." Douglas said his own opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alto and other western cities have gathered a lot of legendary lords, even a small number of blood, dragons and other help, but internal contradictions are great, with churches, nobles The difference in strength is even greater. Unless 'Yinyue' comes, it will only be eaten step by step. On the contrary, here we are very weak, and there are not many legendary lords who can win, but the gap with the strength of the church is not big." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he used the overall strength of the church and the nobility, the second time he singled out the church alone, the specific meaning, not only Fernando understands, Roland also very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando spoke up, and the accent was a bit eccentric, obviously not the native of Holm Kingdom: "In the disintegration and elimination of most of the high-level above After the magician, the cult of truth has already transferred more than half of the legendary priests. At present, only Rantat and Cox have a priest guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“What's the point of this?” Roland frowned and asked inexplicably. “As long as the church beats the legendary lords of the West and sends most of the strong, all our efforts will become bubbles.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gave him a look: "Time, time to develop, time to find allies, time to pick up relationships, get a balanced time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas also smiled: "The enemy of the church is not just us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, when Aalto falls, the church will arrive. The dark mountains are gone, maybe 'Silver Moon' will come." Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s look suddenly became a bit embarrassing: “Even if 'Silver Moon’ comes, I am afraid it will be difficult to counter the Pope.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean, 'God is really so strong?'" Fernando asked both shocked and curiously, they were on the side of the strait, and the information they got did not know how much distortion, and Now, in front of them is a magician who has experienced the battle of Antilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The Light of the Stars of the Stars" fell without rebellion, and even the lock of Antilles was destroyed, I don't know the real How strong is the god of the class, but I know that the 'Star of Light' lord has surpassed the level of legendary peaks when fighting with Antwerp's locks..." Douglas recalls that the kind of reassuring smile disappears. A few minutes and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Roland are silent, although they have no chance to go to Antilles, although Fernando is a member of the Yasso Empire, but as early as the teacher, the elders In the repeated descriptions, Antiphler has been deeply engraved in their hearts. It is the "mystery crown" holy place that all magicians yearn for. It is the city with the strongest fortress on the ground. It is the legendary magician. The strongest place. But only the "God Drop" hit, the governor of the Ilvanas Empire and the locks were destroyed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God Drop" is so strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, they have a deep despair in their hearts, what is the significance of their own efforts? At that time, there was only a question of "God Dropping". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas once again showed a sly smile: "Don't worry too much, the Pope's display of 'God Fall' is not so easy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" This information is too great, Roland has never heard of it, and even suspects that Douglas is comforting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has no beard, and the correct facial features look quite young. He laughs: "Antiler has been falling for almost ten years, but the church has not been large. Westward. Only part of the cardinal is trying. The Pope has never shot once again, watching the desperate people reunite, watching the western territories getting stronger and stronger, I think this may be a bit related."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's say. Before the Pope also encountered the legendary lord's siege. But did not use 'God Drop'. If it is so easy to cast, you can use it to easily solve the battle "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He confessed his guess and did not care that the two magicians opposite him had a lot of reservations for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Fernando fell into meditation. The more I think, the more reasonable it is, and the more vigilant Douglas is. This information has been in front of myself and others for a long time. But no one can connect them together, so sharply pointed out this problem, Douglas sees the problem very thoroughly! Is this related to the strange questions he often asks? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication here, neither side has deepened, after all, has not established true trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped on the outskirts, Fernando and Roland walked through the forest with Douglas, close to a hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this forest, the "Sorcerer Union" has three secret strongholds, one is not yet in use, one is for three magicians to avoid, one place That is, they are going now. As for other organizations, there are no strongholds here, they are not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get around there first." Roland used his mind to connect to Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
