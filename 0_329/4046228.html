			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this helmet surrounded by a knee-shouldered knight, because the field of God was angered by the magical parliament, and asked for a full-scale war, the other cardinals in the Great Hall of Light The members of the Episcopal Church painted the cross on the chest and shouted in unison: "The Holy Glory will be used to purify those evil magicians, so that they will swear at the feet of the Lord, and the realm of God is that mortals can explore!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Platinum with the Platinum Scepter and the Holy Crown with a sacred crown, without a word, the monk leader Valen Hill wearing a simple linen robes step forward "My Majesty the Pope, the request of the Knights of the Knights represents all the devout believers. They are angry because of the embarrassment of the Lord. You can rest assured that the heretics of the North will certainly not attack this attack unless they have abandoned their faith and turned their backs on the truth. So, their roots will collapse on their own, and I even think they will attack the Magic Council angrily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valenhill is barefoot, With short blonde hair, there is a thin face Blue eye abnormalities spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Warren Hill, more than a dozen cardinals who stayed in the Holy City, three referee giants, and epic knights including Stone Acquire: "His Majesty, please order the second Twilight War, call all forces to crusade the Magic Council, leaving only the nobility against the Dark Mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Pope Benedict II raised the bright scepter in his hand, but his voice was old but seemed to contain a vast world: "Your devoutness to the Lord, I am very satisfied, and I feel the joy of the Lord. But I want to ask you, Your faith in the Lord is so fragile? Are you worried that the Magic Council can explore the mysteries of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal can never touch the realm of God! Are you forgotten? The Lord’s instructions to us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bright red cloak is like a wind blowing, the vast sacred light suddenly emerges, it is everywhere Unknown and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the question of the Pope, the members of the Cardinal Mission in the Great Hall of Light are all dumb and deeply reflect on the thoughts and emotional sources in their hearts, except that they come from The wrath of the Lord's captivity, from the reaction of his own faith, does contain a lot of fear, worrying that the Magic Council can study the mystery of the gods as it used to explore the world, so I want to stop it and want to kill this horrible possibility in the cradle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say that I am not guilty, I am deceiving myself. The truth has been blinded by ignorance; I repent of my sin, the Lord is just, kind, I will forgive me and cleanse me of all my sins." After a brief silence, members of the Cardinal Mission have repented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben II quietly listened to their confession: "The exploration of the Magic Council is certainly not close to the realm of God, but their embarrassment is still unforgivable, Lunhill, Baha'u'llah, you choose some monks and night watchmen to go to the Kingdom of Holm to help Feili Bell, kill the magician and try their crimes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "At the same time, you cooperate with some of the elves and druids in Stroop Forest to make the illusion of our upcoming attack, giving them an excuse to recall the druids that cooperate with the Magic Council."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your will, His Majesty the Pope." One of the three giants of the referee, the "Judge" Baha'u'llah and the monk leader Valen Hill simultaneously salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other cardinal members feel that the Pope’s order is appropriate, but it’s a strange feeling. One seems to be able to open a full-scale war and break the fragile situation across the continent. The balance of things turned out to be an ordinary blasphemous event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also good. Although our strength is the strongest, it is subject to joint suppression. If there is no preparation, it may be unbearable to start a war. Continue to wait for a sure chance." The cardinal members of the idea change, while drawing a cross on the chest, exiting the big light hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict II put down his scepter and returned to his study. A cardinal who had been waiting there for a long time asked: "His Majesty, the information sent by the Philippine Cardinal, in addition to the magical parliament and the druids jointly study the magic, and The latest Holm Crown Awards and other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information is archived for later retrieval, and the most important thing is to deal with this sacred event. Benedict II waved his hand to other "little things". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cardinal left and closed the door of the study, the pope looked calmly at the oil painting of the pope on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This oil portrait reads the name of each pope and the year of birth to the embrace of the god of return to truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Charlie I, Holy Calendar 350 years - 572 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afghanistan Suo, the sacred calendar 387 years - 633 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Charlie II, Holy Calendar 408 - 686 years."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict I, Holy Calendar 474-745."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gregory II, Holy Calendar 548-796 Year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict II showed a smile, his voice eloquently and plainly: "How do mortals find the way to explore the mysteries of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............On Saturday morning, the day just dawned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a manor near the town of Sariva, Felipe is doing a magical experiment seriously and dignified, although he only came twice this week. And there is no stay, but the hot and powerful means to cooperate with the parsed structure of the gods is still to make those druids can not find an excuse, can only desperately tamper with the experimental data, but Felipe did not care How about the experiment, all his energy is devoted to the synthesis of an important living substance with non-living matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the radiance of the last alchemy array, Felipe saw a colorless crystal product at low temperatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He controls the excitement of his mood, slowly warms it up, dissolves it into a colorless liquid at a low temperature, and is induced by the magic array. To a smell that stimulates the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe stepped back and released the identification technique, and soon he got the result. This is a fatty acid that you want to synthesize. It is widely believed to be only A living substance that can exist in the body of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no excuse to insist on the theory of human life mechanics." Felipe's gloomy face barely squeezed out a smile. "I don't know the old guys in the organization have How many are willing to admit and accept? Unless they modify the definition of living matter, they must change their cognition. This time I overthrew it, hoping to make it easier for other Necromancers to accept."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that the theory of human life mechanics for more than 30 years has been overthrown by myself. Felipe’s emotions are very complicated, and there are joys and sorrows. If the experiment that was not taught to synthesize urea was shocked, I am afraid I will never accept this fact, let alone change my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside his magic lab, a man in a black hooded robes slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Felipe, who was immersed in complex emotions, woke up and asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hoarse voice of the old man came through the door: "I, Traquil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mr. Traquel? What happened to you looking for me so early?" Felipe asked casually, beginning to unblock the magical array of lab doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traquil is a six-ring necromancer belonging to the pale hand. At present, the level of the Arcane is only three, and the strength is stagnant for a long time. The Seventh Ring was sent to cooperate with Felipe to control those messy druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After releasing the magical array, Felipe suddenly realized that the great sense of danger rose in his heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Not good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab suddenly rises up with a black tentacle composed of pure death force, once touched by them, the magician’s The soul will be polluted and will no longer be able to cast the highest level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, a mummy with a black strip of cloth climbed from the black tentacles and slammed into Felipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
