			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the "Babel Tower", the magic hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark black heavy stone reflects the light of the outer elemental planet, flowing with a strange color, and the silver line drawn by the material is slightly unknown. The three-dimensional feeling, as if there are several faces that change constantly, is a sense of time and space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood in the middle of this magical array, took out a delicate and complicated silver-white pocket watch, and took a moment, then turned his head and looked out the window. The silver-gray sword light that is constantly flashing in the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a month since he submitted the “Lucian equation” that incorporates the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, and the level of the legendary third-order has initially stabilized. Natasha also benefited from the mystery of material production and annihilation, getting closer and closer to the epic field, and making final preparations for the breakthrough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien didn’t tell Natasha when she laid out the magical array of space jumping, not disturbing her whole heart, but she was silently prepared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I just went to the nearby starry sky once, not the ultra-long-distance space to jump to find the planet, nor to reach the fixed track, otherwise it would be so soon ready... ..." Lucien put the pocket watch in the vest pocket of the black double-breasted long dress and sighed with a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time I have prepared to jump towards the stars, not the world-wide transmission, so I have encountered a lot of difficulties, but the purpose is different, the precision The requirements are not high, the distance has not reached the light years, just want to enter the universe to complete an experiment, this can be smoothly prepared in such a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that when Douglas and Oliver searched for the existence of the planet, a space jump of a very long distance would have to be prepared for at least two to three years, and the track with high precision. Jumping is not a big deal for skilled Douglas, but I am afraid I have to spend months preparing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But with this experience, I have a deeper grasp of time and space. Later, the deployment of similar space jumping magic arrays is relatively familiar and easy." Lucien sorted out his black bow tie, and the surrounding silver-white lines were dyed with a ray of light. The entire magic tower began to extract the power of the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright gathering of the road gradually formed a clear and faint mask, and then it shrank with the core of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien feels that the surrounding area is flickering, the curvature of the space is constantly changing, and the defense of the "time and space scepter" is ruined and destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Lucien suddenly felt that she had completely lost weight, floating and vain, surrounded by darkness, countless roads with deadly curses Come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements bless!" As Lucien embarrassed the whimsical and turbulent sound waves around the space, colorful spots emerged, and the mysterious trajectory condensed into A translucent defensive layer, even if it blocks the ray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed, Lucien understood that he had successfully reached the starry sky and was exposed to cosmic rays containing many wonderful particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s face changed and he once again read the mantra in the “Elemental Blessing” mask: “Time and Space Scepter!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cosmic rays actually ignore the elemental blessing and directly penetrate it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little wave of light gathered, a scepter like a squid appeared in the hands of Lucien, then he gently clicked around, and still kept the shortest distance A few weird cosmic rays circumvented his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really dangerous step by step..." Lucien is not sure whether these types of cosmic rays will cause damage to their bodies and souls, but also Do not dare to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he wants to come to the vast sky is not to find traces of the existence of the planet, but to complete the discovery of "positron" (anti-electronic) and let himself " The legendary magic of the Yang Electronic Cannon is complete and maximizes its strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-particles are opposite to the particles. The anti-matter composed of them is opposite to the material. Once they meet, they will collide and annihilate, releasing the horrible energy. According to the formula of mass energy The energy release rate of this reaction is far more than fusion, so that a small amount of antimatter can produce an extremely exaggerated destruction effect, and the whole world can not be destroyed with much antimatter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of improving the "Forgiveness of the Goddess of Ice and Snow", it will take some time to complete, Lu Xien certainly will not make a joke about his life safety, the first time he came to the starry sky, looking for "anti electronic"! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After throwing out the alchemy device, Lucien casts magic and lets the cosmic rays pass through the electromagnetic field inside it to observe the trajectory of the deflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a test of patience, because you have to find the one you want from countless tracks, and it doesn’t have to be there, so time goes by. Lucien changed several positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deflection trajectory of the road is presented in the cloud room. Lucien focuses on distinguishing and calculating. Suddenly, his heart moves, and grasping the alchemy device is a flash. Then a mountain-sized stone in the dark hit the space at an unimaginable high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asteroids..." Lucian whispered to himself, the Lord, the teacher, they couldn’t find the normal planet, this wandering in the stars The asteroids in the sky are occasionally discovered, which is a major hazard in the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shake his head, Lucien didn’t pay attention to it anymore, took out the morning crystal ball and performed astrology to confirm the situation nearby, and then continued to experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful trajectory condensed out in the cloud room, the familiar arc, the opposite direction, in the eyes of Lucien is so kind and lovely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Positive Electronics"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a illusion of the starry sky that represents real-world feedback. Lucien recognizes that the complex magical patterns in the world have increased again and quickly joined together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Lucien floating in space read a long and complicated mantra, and his right hand was stretched out:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yang electronic gun"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless inexplicable things gathering together, a column of light mixed with the illusory flame color swells and swells, and quickly hit another passing asteroid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This asteroid is more dead and bigger than the previous one, but it was immediately dazzled like a star after being hit by Lucien’s “Yang Electronic Gun” The ray of light, the rays of terror are surging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short period of time, everything subsided, and there was no trace of asteroid in place, completely annihilated in space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of this kind of way makes Lucien a slight decapitation, launched the time and space markers left on the body, the starlight around it lit up and disappeared in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time past, Lucy’s scene has become clear and has returned to the top of the “Babel Tower”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the time of the month, Lucien thought thoughtfully: "curvature sailing? Using wormholes? High-dimensional space-time shuttle?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subtracted the experimental time of twenty days, simply calculated the time spent on space transition, and wanted to find the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s heart moved and his eyes turned to the window, just to see a silver-gray sword flashing through, revealing the illusory atmosphere that cuts everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Jianguang, an elemental planet was suddenly divided into two halves, and then the unreal gap that was spread became a myriad of small pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atomic universe has produced a violent shock, as if there is a source of destruction in the center that exudes endless destruction of the sword, and the elements of the star burst simultaneously. The stars are extinguished one after another, the sky changes, and the end of the universe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s mouth is tilted up, revealing heartfelt joy, mental energy, everything in the atomic universe has returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wearing silver-gray armor and taking a tall figure from the window, the face is uncontrollable excitement and excitement: "Lu Xien, I am promoted to epic!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know there will be such a day, but I didn't expect it to be so early." Lucien smiled and looked at Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
