			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Borak looked at the parchment in his hand and couldn’t restrain himself. This magical ritual was too inexplicable, too simple, too funny. It’s like a game played by children! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can also summon the most powerful devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the oldest families in the sacred Heerz Empire, the Gorse family has collected a large amount of magical material inside, allowing members to venture out and cruise the mainland. In the face of magic, there is no way to be at a loss, and it is rumored that this family is the blood descendant of the ancient Sivanas magical empire "Sun King" Tanos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, even if Borak does not have magic, does not understand meditation, and still has a basic understanding of the magic ritual, he has never seen such an inexplicable ritual process. In the simple and funny, it seems that it can faintly feel the incomprehensible surprise, and the back seems to hide the mystery of being unable to rely on people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten minutes of silence, Borak said to himself, as if he was cheering himself: "I am ready to enter into a contract anyway. It is okay to try this ceremony. If it is useless, it will be teased, no loss, if it can be summoned, then..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fist is tightly gripped, The expression is distorted, revealing obvious desire, expectation and tyranny in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw that the mechanical clock was pointing at 11:30, and Borak quickly got up to look for white candles, mirrors, apples and knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more eager, the more unsatisfactory things seem. After ten minutes, Borak found a mirror and a knife, white candles and apples don’t know. Where did you hide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Borak very regretted that he had dismissed all the servants and gave them a day off, and this nobleman himself used to find things for himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that he is about to miss the midnight, Borak’s own slap in the face, he can’t wait to wait until midnight tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolke was so anxious that he was so sweaty that he found white candles and apples in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere has it been, Borak is so fond of these two ordinary things as he is now, and he feels delighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hurry to return to the study, Borak blew out other candles, leaving only one candlestick in his hand for a brief illumination, then pulling on the curtains, setting up mirrors, candles, Apple and knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at the time, seeing only two minutes to midnight, Borak quickly smashed his half-length blond hair, messed up like The evil witch in the story of the bard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, Borak sat quietly behind the desk, waiting for the coming of time, suddenly he remembered something, suddenly anxious: "Mechanical clock will not Not allowed? Will you miss the midnight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old stupid clock often slows down for a few minutes and has to be fixed to watch workers Come to adjust, but now there is no standard time to compare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking out the pocket watch and confirming that there was no difference in time, Borak began to doubt the exact surname of his pocket watch, although he knew that it was twelve o’clock at midnight. By the time of the morning, not the narrow point of twelve o'clock, but I can't help but worry about it, I am suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger the hope, the stronger the tension! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ticking of the pointer is very noticeable on a quiet night, and it seems to resonate with the heartbeat of Borak, making him feel that the heart is about to jump from the chest. Come out, the blood is flowing wildly, and the forehead is swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the low midnight sounded at 12 o'clock, Borak’s back consciousness was stretched out, and the candlestick was blown out, then the white candle was almost ignited. The candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light appears dark and sullen under the reflection of the mirror, and the jumping between the two is like hiding the countless devils in the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After swallowing two sputum, Borak picked up the cyan apple and knife with his trembling hands and began to peel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never cut my own skin, but Borak has the strength of a high-ranking knight, the control of my hands is not bad, even if the action is very clumsy. A few times, I almost cut it, and I also passed through it with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak gradually cuts smoothly, his eyes move up, looking into the mirror, only in the mirror, his face is covered with messy hair, and The dimly lit candlelight reflects the sense of light and dark bumps, and the light flows, which looks strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never seen myself in this way, and Borak’s heart can’t help but chill out, and there’s a sense of strangeness in the mirror, as if the soul broke into Hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of a hand, Borak looked down and saw that the apple had been completely cut, and a thin curl of thin skin was twisted on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Successful?" Borak quickly looked up to see if he summoned the devil, but only the one who looked forward to and stunned in the mirror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong disappointment, Borak whispered: "Don't you make a mistake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strange breeze was blowing in the confined room, and the dim light of the white candle trembled. Borak looked at the mirror in a responsive manner, and saw the blonde blue-eyed himself looking straight. Come over, there is no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just looking down in dismay, the corner of the mirror in the mirror suddenly evokes a strange smile, then tears the face, let the whole face peel off, revealing blur The flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" In the face of such a strange and so horrifying scene, Borak screamed in fear and wanted to step back and found himself sitting in the chair. Above, only the backrest can be tightly attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vague flesh began to distort and squirm, turning into a "devil" with a white face and a long red tongue:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your call, come from the deepest part of hell, please say your request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold and cold The sound made Borak tremble a few more times, but he woke up and he really summoned the devil! This inexplicable magical ritual really works! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to be a knight, no, I want to be a big knight, I want to be the Duke of the gorse!" Borak exclaimed excitedly, at this time, In his eyes, the opposite of this ugly and horrible "devil" is such a dear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil's law, to get what, you have to pay the same price, are you ready to pay the price?" Long tongue fell on the chest With a sway, the "Devil" said with a cold smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak just wants to blurt out and he is ready, suddenly a flash of light, forcibly stopped: "Requesting different things, the price to be paid is different, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am one of the first and oldest seven devils in hell, 'greedy', you need to pay for your greed to my satisfaction. Said the self-proclaimed greedy devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never seen this kind of devil, but after listening to the original and oldest seven devils, Borak remembered that he was in the family secret library. Inside, I saw a scroll about the legend of the Sun King Tanos, which mentioned seven ancient mysterious ancient devils such as greed and hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Borak thoroughly believes in the magic contract: "Respected greedy lord, what do I have to pay to become the Duke of the gorse? What is the price of the big knight? Just to become a regular knight, but what is the cost of retaining the advanced knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal with the devil, absolutely Can't be deceived, Borak remembered the "father" note, "I can't sell the soul to the devil, and I can't rely on it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed" The devil faintly said: "Become the Duke of the gorse, you need to give me the soul after death, rest assured, you will live forever in my field Enjoy endless happiness; become a great knight, I want to get the remaining life after you deduct 50 years ago, whether you can become a knight or a golden knight, you can only live to fifty years old; if only become ordinary Knight, but retain the possibility of advanced knights, I need you to exchange for ten years of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
