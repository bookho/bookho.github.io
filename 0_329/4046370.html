			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is shining, the lake is swaying, and it seems that the completely frozen Berak has not yet begun to fall, and the light blue, snow-like solid air around it has turned into Patter of water droplets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain fell into the air and soon turned into a white mist, blending into the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air-condensed ice cubes are finished, and Bellak’s magic robe and body are like a sand sculpture, which turns into a fluffy white powder scattered and glitters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This power..." "Evans's extremely cold ray" effect is beyond the expectation of Lucien, a six-ring high-level magician is showing In the case of defensive spells, it is terrible that even people bring magic and the air is frozen together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is inconsistent with Bellac's underestimation of the ultra-low temperature limit of the extreme cold ray, the choice of the wrong defensive magic is related, but it is also impossible to cover up the comparison from the freezing effect alone, this seven-ring Magic has surpassed most of the same level of ice and snow magic, and even more terrifying is that it can be used by the quasi-high-level magician who is initially essential to the cognitive world with the cooperation of the casting materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, on a certain level, Lucien reduced the similar seven-ring magic to the requirements of the five or six rings, while maintaining the power. Like the things that the Magic Council has done in the past few hundred years, many of the magics of the Seventh Ring, Eight Rings, and Nine Rings have reduced the requirements of one or two rings, and even reduced from the high to the middle. In the case of the ancient inheritance of the magician, if the opportunity is appropriate, it is not impossible to challenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the major advances in arcane research! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the frozen ring, talisman and other items fell on the small island in the center of the lake, Lucien returned to God, Turning to look at Affris, I saw that its translucent amber eyes were staring at the ice and snow powder that Bellak had become, which seemed unbelievable and unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also shocked by the horror of "extreme cold rays"? Let it be kept secret! Lucine thought silently, smiling at Affris: "What's wrong? Nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ring...the talisman..." The tender voice of Fris contains the emotion of "sorrowfulness", defeating the enemy, and collecting the spoils is one of its greatest hobbies. As for the horrible frozen rays, the five-ring magician can perform and kill high-level magic. I am sorry for the strange magic of the teacher. I have no mood to think for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the normal Aphrodite, Lucien wiped out the cold sweat that does not exist: "The broken materials are also very valuable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after Lucien’s cognition of the world’s initial realization, the more elemental use of the “elemental vortex” has not been exhausted, or even Used twice, so with Affleck, there are still many ways to get rid of Bellac, but Lucien is careful and uses the strongest card directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Averys regained his energy and asked to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Lucien answered without changing his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials are really valuable, compared to the value of the ring and the talisman itself, it is too far apart, plus the frozen items that have been frozen, even one or two It may not be comparable. However, how can such a thing tell Affris, anyway, it is only collected and watched, and will not be sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite fanned back, swooped down, and scraped the material at lightning speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aphrodite, am happy?" Lucien "smiles" and said, "Well!" Aphrodite counted the fine light in his hand. Flash material, and I will answer with pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, it’s time to return the 'element' ring to me." Lucien continued to "smile." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite is stiff, like a thunder, and then "if nothing": "I continue to pretend to be you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need to go out for a while." Lucien pushed a single piece of glasses, contacted teacher Fernando, classmate Tom, elemental will president Morris, Lavendi, etc. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Kingdom of Holm, Rantart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Adrian ended his sermons to several conservative aristocrats and stepped out of a heavily guarded manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coachmen who were parked nearby saw the dragon scales and sneaked into the front of Adrian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow Adrian’s more than a dozen bishops, pastors, and knights, step forward and divide into two columns, “guarding” the door of the carriage in the middle , welcome Adrian to the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adrian drew a cross on his chest, whispered a few words, and then kept the cardinal majesty and temperament slowly toward the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sense of danger in his heart permeated, like the warning of the Lord, the subconscious used a seven-level magical "chaotic transmission." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A door that is adorned with white light and full of sacredness opens in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when he wants to step in, the illusory door that is like the entrance to the Heaven Mountain is violently shaken and shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine Rings Force Field Magic, "Space Lock"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, the surrounding temperature rises rapidly, the air is hot and twisted, and the ground is turned into orange-yellow magma. The dozens of bishops, pastors, and knights are too late to scream. When it is issued, it becomes a blue smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrade's Cardinal Robe begins to melt, triggering the creation of "magic absorption armor" and "sword barrier" in the horrible heat and flame Melt like a candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring elemental magic, "Raven's Flame Hell"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trigger effect is generated, but the "glorious jump" is still locked, Andrade can only mourn the death of coking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, the tumbling "flame hell" subsided, and the coachmen were scared to see a deep crater, and its range was just ten. Several clergymen wrapped up, and the carriages with a few fingers away from the carriage were unscathed, and the dragon scales were still snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual flame burned a few words on the ground not far away:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Revenge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... At noon, a quiet church in the city of Rentatt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no believer in here, because it has been transformed into a "monastery" dedicated to the use of monks, all the gorgeous luxury decoration has been replaced, planting full of symbolic suffering The thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original bishop’s room, a young man in his twenties is tempering his soul with pain and tenacity in the darkness. He keeps his size and is tall. Thick, giving the impression of a mountain that never collapses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the most devout, gifted, and most studied Abraham of this generation of monks, and many of the newly revised theological content is his . Although Wallenhill did not like his point of view, he had to admit that he was likely to be promoted to the Cardinal level within five years. He was also one of the more than a dozen young clergy who had the most hope to step into the Holy Spirit. Cardinal and cardinal evaluation of the future "saints"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Magic Council frequently blasphemed the gods and the church shifted its focus, he was the first priest to come to the Kingdom of Holm, in his own words: "Only the hardships and dangers can pure the piety of the Lord. How can the glory of devotion be manifested without suffering and death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham walks barefoot on the thorns The room, the pain did not make him a little snoring, suddenly, his eyes opened, the whole dark room seemed to be bright, like a holy thing coming from the paradise mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside, four meteorites with flames descended from the sky and slammed into the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic "Meteor explosion"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
