			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s spiritual field covers the entire study, ** swaying the magical squad, directing Taling, the host is locked by Aringe, controlling The overall situation of the "city of the sky", it is difficult to give too much attention to the sorcerer, and said through the study: "What is the abnormal situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The one who controls the lock will not find the "city of the sky" exception? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant said in a hurry: "Several members of the highest panel should return without returning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, while walking to the study room in a panic, but Brooke was distracted, did not lift the defensive magic array, but directly asked: "Who is there?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is..." The sergeant vaguely spit out a word and suddenly rushed forward, and the whole body became blurred and twisted, like a ray of different colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zezzi, in the strange voice, this devilish phantom passed through the first layer of magic, but it quickly returned to the condensate Really, between two layers of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it continually travels through the magical array and rushes toward Brooke in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the magical array effect appears, it turns from virtual to virtual, seems to be in another world, permeates the space, and smoothly crosses the past, but Its state seems to be unsustainable, and it will soon re-collapse, so it can't directly penetrate the layer of magical array. It must rely on the magical array to operate with a precision of a few millimeters to find itself in the "rise and tide" The neutral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook is only waking up. The ancient devil "infected" is not an ordinary situation, but has been possessed by a powerful "Ancient Devil" character. With the help of a special seed planted in his heart long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the "ancient devil" with his eyes and two electric lights, trying to tell who the body is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Devil" face is constantly changing face, sometimes young, sometimes old, sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly, dazzling. But Brooke recognized one of the faces and was slightly amazed: "Mermos?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only peak epic knight today! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mermos" laughed wildly: "Mermos is dead, standing here is one of the incarnations of the true god Viken! "Brick sighed as if he understood something: "You are the knight I have seen the most determined will, the most religious, and the best known to myself. I can't think of it." You will also choose the path of the ancient devil, and also use the original method without the container to share the negative emotional effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every cardinal member You can find legendary pseudo-god, demon king, etc. as your own container. After all, there are only so many strong players at this level. Therefore, many people finally choose the "Tanos version" with great hidden dangers, and will Melmos, who is determined and consciously able to overcome negative emotions, was the first to complete this, and after it was completed, it really didn't have much impact. At least before the impact of the gods, there was no hidden danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after he was used by Wicken to assimilate this time, the negative emotions in his heart broke out completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the case of Viken’s **, the “old devils” of the twelve cardinal members were made up of the “fallen seeds” "Being attached to different characters, trying to stir up confusion and create more negative emotions for Wicken to absorb." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this kind of "fallen seed" that can avoid the "Arinard Lock" or the Rantat Divine Array is extremely demanding and must be the target person. Wholeheartedly let go of the body and mind, let the "devil" project into the body, and originally had to have negative emotions above the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More difficult and more subtle than this is another projection, that is, the projection of Viking to control the legendary powers such as Saint Mary and Philip. In this case, only the selection of some highly devout clergymen can help the students to break through to the legend and resonate with the "Heavenly Mountain", and with the cover of the "God of Truth" gift, they can silently project success. The target person was not aware of it until he was mastered at the crucial moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, it can still use its own "morning" blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that his understanding of blood power is beyond all legendary powers, grasping one of the essences, no wonder he is the only peak knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook once again sighed and told Taling Prosper to close the top three floors, and on Monday, the current was flowing, the magnetic field appeared, the darkness was distorted, and stunned. This is the "electromagnetic kingdom". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to drag "Mermos" into his own half-face battle, so as not to affect other magicians in Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, "Mermos" is to create confusion and more negative emotions, how can you give up this opportunity, even though the body of the ** And the soul can only play a short-lived legendary peak strength, but it is also enough to initially counter the powerful suction from the electromagnetic kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is Atlet's student George, Atlante?" Brooke suddenly thought of this as he played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rentart City, Nexel Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-gray sword flashed through, and a knight in a sturdy and beautiful body armor saw that his body had become two, and his face remained. The disgusting expression of the agony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, his two bodies were divided into countless pieces of meat by the illusory and narrow gaps, falling to the ground like rain<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, I saw the tall, straight back in front of me, the purple long hair and silver-gray armor that saw her shawl, and the nobles who hid in Nexel Palace. A long sigh of relief, the body still can not control the trembling, it is terrible, too terrible! A day knight has become a devil, killing a lot of nobles, if the Queen is not in time to arrive, I am afraid that he has been killed by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another epic knight in the Kingdom of Holm, Winston is guarding the territory of the alien space, so all their hopes are pinned on the Queen Natasha His body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, the Magic Council has a good study of the ancient devils. There are not many powerful knights projected, otherwise we are not able to, but other low-level knights and ordinary People, negative emotions can be thick enough to satisfy the initial infection of ancient devils. I have already told the Knights of Truth and the Knights of the Guardian to start the action, and with the cooperation of the police, clear the 'infected', Lentat is very It will recover soon." Natasha made her clear voice become calm and abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very aware of the scale and damage caused by the "infected person" is limited, it will take a long time to calm down, and really decide the fate of everyone is still in the sky The battle of the gods and legends that are displayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s uneasy temperament, calm and firm attitude, straight and straight back, let the aristocratic trembling souls calm down, all kinds of negative emotions It began to dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, John guarded Joel, Eliza, Grand Duke Oawi, and others from the secret room of the palace, carrying a back A thick rifle with a silver-gray metallic luster, covered with a dense symbol of electricity and magnetism - this is the "Gaussian rifle" that Lucien himself made for him, and one shot equals one Knight’s strike. John is currently close to the strength of the breakthrough and equipment blessing, barely able to use three rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the 'Atomic Universe'." Natasha said without hesitation in front of his father, Joel, John, many aristocrats, they can absolutely Protect their safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John nodded and walked into the portal of Natasha’s left hand with a complex expression of the Grand Duke of Vaolirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the expressions of the nobles suddenly become vivid, full of deep expectations and hopes, if they also enter the "atomic universe", can't they Avoid the chaos outside and avoid attacks that don't know where they will come from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Her Majesty, can we also enter the atomic universe? We can only add to your confusion here, and will also distract you." The count led the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Mausoleum, we are all loyal people, please shelter us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aristocratic look exhilaratingly echoes, for a while, it seems This idea is expected to return, and the "people" are in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha slightly sideways, blocking the "transportation door", looking around the aristocrats in a circle, majesticly said: "You are hiding here, you will not Go to the 'atomic universe'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Her Majesty, are we not yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Her Majesty, do you want to abandon the covenant between the king and the nobility? Do you not fulfill the obligation to protect us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not worthy of being a queen ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice of doubt and condemnation from the mouth of the aristocracy, the sudden death situation caused them to accumulate too much fear, after being rejected by Natasha, It broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father, Aunt Camille, Uncle Joel, Alice, and others in Lucien, have long been protected by me and Lucien. Underneath, I can be sure that they have not been infected by the ancient devil, not projected, and you, I am not sure, so, in order to 'safety of the atomic universe'..." Natasha did not scream loudly, and It is calm and calm like the dishes that you are going to prepare tonight. "Whoever comes close to the portal, die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't leave her alone, rush over, enter' "Atomic Universe," she didn't dare to kill us! Unless she didn't want to continue to be a queen!" In the crowd, a nobleman shouted loudly and suddenly received a warm response. The aristocrats who were scared by the scene of death just now were crowded. Go to the "Transportation Gate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold and ruthless silver-gray sword passed by, the first few nobles saw each other’s upper body separated from the **, the blood spurted the crowd behind Head full of faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She, she really dares to kill us..." One aristocrat was paralyzed, standing in the same place, no longer dare to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha Silver Purple is indifferent and has no emotional authenticity: "I said, anyone who is close to the portal will die."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of truth slanted to the ground, and the nobles suddenly subconsciously stepped back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, an old voice suddenly sounded in the crowd: "When did you find me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles were scared to flash, revealing the old man who did not know when to hide there, his face constantly changing, from a familiar count to a vicissitudes old man, the only thing in common Yes, "they" are closed their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atlante, it's you..." Natasha swayed the sword of truth and smiled in a low voice. "The whole thing does have some Vulnerabilities, such as the aristocrats' emotions are too exaggerated. The Knights of the day just focused on killing and let them run here. Of course, this can be explained by negative emotions and the influence of ancient devils, but for me, there is nothing. The difference, because even if you are not driven, even if this is a normal event, I will kill anyone who dares to approach the portal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time The safety of the 'atomic universe' must be guaranteed. After all, Lucien’s resurrection means are in the Tower of Babel, and I can’t allow me to have a big idea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, The portal lights up and John walks out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Natasha asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John solemnly said: "I am your knight, the captain of the Knights of Truth. At this time, I want to be with my players. Together, they guard the security of Holm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was silent and nodded: "Go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante quietly watched John leave, watching the nobles escape from the palace, and smiled bitterly: "A real knight... I also want to like him, but I It is only known today that ** will be controlled by Viken after the ancient devil state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
