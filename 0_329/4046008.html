			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this kind of thing has already happened, and there is no more library in my mind. It’s not too eccentric and unacceptable. There is a large part of the books in my mind that can't be opened and I can't see the content. Lucien is very confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to stay calm, so that the library in your mind won’t be “touched” because of the emotional ups and downs, and Lucien’s book is read locally. Record what books can be opened and what books cannot be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Historical books can be opened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book of economics, no problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art books can also be opened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mathematics, physics, chemistry Some books can be used, and some books can't be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it because of the different world rules, so I can't open it, but I remembered it. When you have similar knowledge, at least college level, you can think of it without being blocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of books that can be opened, mainly in the middle and high school However, the university comprehensive library will certainly not collect junior high school textbooks, but some scattered teaching research and corresponding degree of medieval papers for students' reference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of books in the library. After Lucien just read a small part, they found these problems, but they were not sure, and they could not understand why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big illness is just right, Lucien’s body is very weak now, and his mental condition is not good. After reading a lot of books in succession, his mind is already confused. I can't feel the library anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong back to the bed, Lucien falls asleep, raises the spirit, restores health, can face the good tomorrow, Lucien can not forget There is only one black bread left, and survival is always in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping sleepy, the sound of screaming and the sharp and sharp biting of the wood into the ear of the road, will dream of a lot of food and warmth He woke up in a soft bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lussin, who is sleepy, turned up a confused Body, ready to continue to sleep, but the mouse is getting louder and louder on the wood and on the stone, and it is getting more and more harsh. This makes Lu Xien, who is sensitive to the night, feel overwhelmed and can no longer fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for a long time, the bite still didn’t stop. Lucien had to pull the blanket up and cover the ear, but the sound seemed to be penetrating. Generally, from all directions, it is impossible to keep a quiet environment to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this life of Nima?" Lucien, who became irritated, couldn’t help but swear and felt that she was a little mentally weak. It is the most unpalatable food, such as black bread fermented with wood chips. It is the worst linen dress that is worn on the skin. It is covered with a blanket that is not very warm and does not look like the original material. Even if you can forget all the troubled sleep for a while, you can't get peace, oh, oh, like there are thousands of mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien bite his teeth with hatred and listen carefully to the direction of the rat's voice. Since they can't fall asleep, it is better to find these mice. Kill one or two, scare away the other, and secretly curse and swear: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to get rid of this life as soon as possible!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to the ear, Lucien tried to distinguish the direction from the bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱吱吱,吱吱吱......呜呜呜,呜呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lucien concentrated himself, he found out that what he heard was the sound of the mouse, and it was clearly a burst of sullen crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜,呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet late night, there are no more mice The sound of screaming and biting, only the cry of sadness and sadness came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rollover stood up from the bed, and Lucien unconsciously opened the crates and took the remaining black bread in his hand as a weapon of self-defense. In any case, in terms of hardness, it was enough to stun the thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚,呜呜呜......咚咚咚,呜呜呜......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian was very strange about what the sly voice was, but immediately discovered that it was his heartbeat, which was so intense in his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinister wind blew, Lucien’s hand clenched the black bread, and he couldn’t stand the fear: “This is magic and magic. The world, is it really a ghost of grievances?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, experience the crossing, plus the gods in the daytime and the burning of the living people are scared and afraid Experience, Lu Xien did not have soft hands and feet in this horrible atmosphere, the mind is blank, the spirit is tight, while slowing down the breath, forcibly calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step to the door, Lucien distinguished the direction of the crying voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying is full of bleakness, in the middle of the night that is very quiet, so obvious, but the neighbors seem to be lost in the dream, no one Give a little bit of movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This crying seems to be from the right wall." The closer Lucerne is to the door, the clearer the cry, "Wait, I On the right side of the house, isn't it the residence of the burned witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was shocked: "Is her residence not burned by the church?" Is there a hidden cellar or secret room that hides her grievances and other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the hidden secret room, I have seen many novels of Lucien The words in the brain suddenly flashed "adventures", "treasures", "magic notes" and other words, a little bit of greed can not help but appear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜,呜呜呜...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying seems to be a bit stern, give way Sean involuntarily shuddered and his mind woke up. "Even if there are treasures and magic notes, it is also in the guardianship of this crying spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am just an ordinary person who has just recovered from a serious illness, and I don't know how powerful the world's grievances are, what are the shortcomings, and what to do to deal with grievances?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe you will be confused, killed, or possessed by the grievances!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking up, Lucien analyzes his own situation, the more he wants to be Fear, if you are blinded by greed, you will be stunned by the adventures, and you will find it, and then you will be buried underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it can't wait like this, who knows whether the grievance will run up." Lucien's brain turned quickly and thought about the countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huo Ran, Lucien’s flash of light, thinking of the power that can be used, so he carefully leaned against the door, fearing that it would pop out behind or in front of him. A grievance, the black bread was soaked by the sweat of Lucien's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pulling the wooden door a little, Lucien’s forehead is full of cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door is half open, the night is dark, and the cold wind is rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stepped out of the door and saw a light in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no wraiths in the front, back, left, and right, and after coming out of the house, the ghost crying has become very small and fuzzy, and Lucien relaxes a little. One point, take a deep breath, take another breath, and then shout out loud:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are ghosts! There are ghosts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is so loud that even Sean himself was shocked. I didn’t expect that it was this effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang Wangwang", the wild dogs were scared and screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While listening to this, Lucien hurried to Ade to let the church run, and the purification of the grievances of course must be professional! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
