			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the periodic table has been in use for more than two years, it has an irrefutable rule of surname that is used all the time and researches it. The magicians suggest that the atom is not so simple, otherwise it shows the law of the cycle name, so when Morris, Lavendi, Gaston and other high-level leaders began to slowly point out the problem, concealing the guidance of atomic errors, most of the middle and high order The arcane masters gradually became confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "closed training" Hathaway uses the discovery of the same element to give her a self-established atomism a heavy blow, the element will not doubt the atom There are very few middle and high level arcane masters who are wrong. Low-level arcans, magic apprentices, etc. are more easily accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easier to change the magician beyond the will of the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an era of rapid development of terror. Not only is the Magic Council more and more in-depth exploration, the Southern Church, the Northern Church, and the Druid are all growing rapidly. Who is left behind, maybe it will disappear after a hundred or two years. Therefore, after seeing the situation of changing viewpoints, the sense of urgency makes the highest appraisal group no longer wait, and the "Arcane" of the October issue is decided. The first article on Lucien's paper "The Discovery of a New Particle" opens the curtain for exploring the micro world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the rare part of the Arcane division who would not doubt the atomic theory, it is not considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's cruel, but it's also very realistic." Outside the magician's management department, Lucien commented on Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar is a staunch elemental mage, and the bright and optimistic smile has become very bleak, almost sorrowful: "I think of Lucien, you are often joking." The words of history, the wheel of history is rolling forward, and everything that blocks it is completely crushed, but not long ago, they were still known as excellent arcane masters who have the potential and know how to endure hard, just one month. How did time become a forerunner of destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Atomic Research Institute" is the "site" of Lucien, the thought of magicians and magic apprentices in the Institute The task of changing the viewpoint naturally has to be completed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, as the discoverer of the periodicity of the element, the first arcane teacher who questioned the meaning behind the law, Lucien’s attitude has long been indirectly affected. The friends around me, plus the cathode ray, were discovered by the Atomic Research Institute. Many experiments were done by themselves, and the low-level Arcanists are still in the stage of use and understanding of most of the theories, and things are going very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So two weeks ago, Lucien had already read the papers to them and demonstrated the experiment again. Everyone accepted the more tiny particles. The fact that atoms are not necessarily impossible to divide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the cruelty of fate. But they are also using the periodic table of elements, and there is a foreshadowing in front. The impact should only make them aware of the world's broken rather than Crash, even if it is difficult to advance, there is still a glimmer of hope. It is not ruled out that they will overcome themselves one day and re-accept the possibility of changing the atomic theory." Lucien understands that Lazar is cheerful and enthusiastic, and the friendship is broad, in the elements. There are many friends inside the will, and one of the dozen or so arcane masters who could not accept the atomic theory being questioned this time has a good relationship with him, so he comforted him a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar smiled: "No need to comfort, Lucian, I am just a moment of feeling, actually on the road of magic, for various reasons There are many people who go forward and even die every year. They are much better than the magicians who are inexhaustible in the laboratory and are unable to get rid of the curse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Lazar coughed and learned the words of "Judges": "The magicians are trying to spy on the realm of God and violate the prohibition, so they will be inexplicably exhausted, violent or cursed. It is the price of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is the fear of the god of truth! The closer we are to the truth of the world, the more mad, the more Desperately cursing us. Being cursed by Him means that we are on the right path, and one day we will uncover his hypocritical mask!" Lucien saw Lazar and was still joking, so he smiled and matched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two dialogues are the classic lines in the recently popular Alinge’s opera "Serrod", which are loved by magicians and can be heard everywhere. A similar dialogue - "Serrod" is a fictional magician who has excellent arcane and magical talents, puts forward a lot of essential laws and improved a lot of powerful magic, but later he was loved by lovers. Sell ​​out and let the church catch and burn. This dialogue appeared in the "referee". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock looked at them and watched them "staged" in the opera, "helpless" authentic: "You like to play on your own. Lucy, don't you have excellent musical talent? Lord Oliver's script is great, you can adapt it. The musicians who have become operas have not been good enough. For example, the story of "Cerrod" is very moving, but the melody is hard to be called a classic. In short, don't delay me to update the arcane badge, I can't wait to see how much I am promoted. Step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked through the middle of the two, Annick, Heidi and other apprentices also looked at Lu Xien a little embarrassed Then I immediately followed the excitement and went to the office of the different deacons. They are about to become official archermen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Before they worked, they were preparing for the promotion of the official magician. It wasn’t Lucy reminder that they almost forgot to update the badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, maybe, I am already in the middle class?" Lazar returned to God, unable to resist and turned to Eric's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this month due to the completion of many experiments on cathode ray, let his paper drop to an article, but there should be reference points! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head and walked into Eric’s office. Today it was because he casually said that he was going to update the badge and buy it. The latest issue of "Arcane" made the members of the entire Atomic Research Institute collectively dispatched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only five Arcane points to the third level, Lazar, the discovery of the cathode ray really makes you 'satisfied'." Rick was quite lamented, using the slang of Allinge to "eat enough" to tease Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before doing it, Lazar had long smiled and was excited. At this time, he licked his lips and shook his head: "There are still five Arcane points, I don't know when I can get together..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien coming in, Eric did not continue to sit as before. Instead, I got up and shook hands: "I heard that many members of the Magic Research Committee are not optimistic about the 'Atom Research Institute'. I don't think Evans can make any big achievements in three years. In two months, you discovered a new ray that was highly valued by the Audit Committee.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Atomic Research Institute may be more than we expected The future, unfortunately my main research direction is not an element, otherwise I would like to resign from the deacon position to join the Institute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you Mr. Eric for your value, We don’t have to worry about the results for at least three years, so we can study in the direction we envisioned. Help me update you about the badge? "Lucien will own five Silver Stars Arcane badge and handed Eric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s stiff face reveals a suspicious smile: “The results of the impact factor have come out, and Arcane and Magic are the highest 3.0. The level of the Arcans who have the ability to put their papers on these two journals will increase quickly. Evans has many papers published in "Arcane", and there will be no less in the future, maybe two or three years later. Become a 6th-level Arcanist, promote the ranks, which is much faster than your magic level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that he will take Lucien’s arcane The badge was placed in a small cage and the bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, today is the number one, the impact factor is officially implemented in the flood season, what is the other journals?" Lucien only knows "Arcane" "Magic "Elements" and "Organic Arcanist Monthly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took out a document that had just been released for a long time: "With the exception of "Arcane" and "Magic", there is no 3.0, "Electromagnetic" The journals of the seven factions, such as "Power Field" and "Elements", are 2.5, "Light and Dark", "Imagination", "Transformation", "Summoning", four factional journals, journals sponsored by five magical parliamentary divisions, and "Gome" and "Ice "The journals in six small fields are 2.0."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northern Enchanted Journal of the Sorcer Islands, the Magical Parliamentary Division Monthly, "Sound Wave" The journals of nine small fields, as well as the "General Oralist Monthly" are 1.5, and the five comprehensive journals such as "Blessing" and "Curse" and "Arcane Discussion" are 1.0."< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, due to the increase of magicians, the Audit Committee approved the addition of a small field journal and three comprehensive journals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
