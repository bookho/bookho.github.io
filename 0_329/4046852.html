			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square near the Rendez Rose Avenue, the lights are at the beginning, the crowd is bustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the habit of many Rantat citizens. After dinner, walk to the nearest square and wait for the beginning of the "Sound of Mystery", but with the order to send newspapers The activities of the magic radio are deep, and there is no such thing as a sea of ​​people in the heyday. Of course, in absolute terms, there are still many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello everyone, FM 592.6m Holtz, here is the voice of mystery, I am your old friend Nightingale, thank you for listening to us at this moment. The show..." With the familiarity of the sweet voice of his family coming out of the horn, all the listeners focused their attention, no longer talking and laughing with their neighbors, and after the last live broadcast, they were able to The sound restores the look of Miss Nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one show, it seems that there is a "magic lecture hall" that everyone doesn't understand but is full of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear listeners, I will explain to you how to prevent the superficial hypnotic spells... Zizz..." The magnetic boy has not said In a word, there was a slightly harsh and sharp sound in the horn. Then, the sharp disappeared and became the noisy current of Zizzi, but everything quickly returned to normal, but the low-magnetic male voice changed back. Nightingale" sweet and moving but excited and trembling voice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear listeners, listeners, here is the voice of 'mystery', now insert a news..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" The audience looked at each other and had encountered temporary signal interruptions before, but never recovered so quickly. And also changed the show! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert news? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something they have never experienced before, so it’s not a reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the noble villa. In the civilian buildings, in a variety of schools, a listener who is listening to the "voice of mystery" is a similar expression, do not understand what happened, there will be a strange form of interspersed news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Atomic Research Institute", due to the buds sent by students Yeriya told Heidi and Annick about the vision of "two suns in the sky", so they decided to pay the transfer fee themselves and return to the ground in advance. I want to know for the first time what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both curiosity and hope to prepare for all kinds of bad conditions in the shortest time. After all, if there is something in the universe, what is wrong with the ground? It is very likely that you will not be able to return. When the energy is consumed, it is the end of the "space corpse". For similar reasons, none of them who have not yet married have left the Allinge Magic Tower, but applied for a nighttime laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, have you discovered a new particle?" The vision of the two suns has been discussed for a whole afternoon plus dinner time, so Lei Yili Ya couldn't help but transfer the topic and asked about Heidi's discovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the curious eyes of friends such as Lei Yiya, Ophelia and others. Heidi smiled and said: "After repeated confirmation, it is a new particle different from the discovered particles. The mass is about two hundred times that of electrons, and the speed is very fast."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "A new particle, isn't the number of elementary particles not conforming to the 'simple' principle?" The more essential the more essential things are the philosophical views that many arcists believe. Like the ubiquitous magical "symmetry", Rock took off his black top hat. There was not much dust on it, and he said with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At present, only the experimental results can be respected. Maybe the basic particles are not basic?" Heidi said that Lu Xi's famous saying "vacuum is not empty", then she looked Looking at the wall clock on the lab wall, I cheered, "The Voice of Mystery started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be more than "World Real Channel" Like "the voice of mystery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roque slightly said: "It's possible. Right, find new particles to bring you 'real world' feedback?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Heidi, haven’t you always complained that you haven’t won the Holm Crown Awards and other awards? This time, discovering new particles should make you realize your wishes.” Katrina is happy for her friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi shook his head and didn’t expect to be authentic: “I found that new particles should not be available, unless it is a very important new particle, such as Lord Hathaway. The kind of prophecy, or the introduction of 'new methods' to discover new particles, I am still waiting for the breakthrough of artificial intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not Hathaway What kind of predictions do you predict?” Annick and Katrina and others are quite surprised. From the current measured attributes, the new particles are very similar to the “meson” predicted by Lord Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi snorted: "You must experiment with it and participate in strong interactions to know that it can only be defaulted by default."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I watched my companions pick up the top awards in different fields, how could she have no thoughts and desires in her mind, but this will not prevent her from making rational judgments for the time being because she is artificial The prospect of intelligence is more and more confident, I believe that sooner or later I will get a certain award for this, even the Evans Arcane Award. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the discussion, they suddenly heard the sound of Zizz in the magic radio, which attracted their attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, listeners, here is the voice of mystery, now a newsletter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After the sound of the nightingale, the expression of Heidi and others immediately became solemn. If anything is worthy of such a broadcast, it is obviously a strange situation in which two suns appear during the day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the Atomic Research Institute was quietly anomalous, and only the sweet voice was heard in the magic radio:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"According to the notice just issued by the highest parliamentary assembly of the parliament, at 11:37 am, Rantaut time, the Arcanist, the legendary magician, and the member of the Supreme Council, 'Atomic Control', Lucien Evan Lord S. found the sun at the standard cosmic coordinates..., confirming the existence of the planet, causing unprecedented "real world" feedback, causing two solar anomalies in the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please witness this abnormal audience not to be afraid, this is not the end of the day. And on the contrary, it marks the most solid step for our intelligent creatures to explore the universe. It won't be bothered by the existence of the planet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the harvest of Evans himself must be very rich, it is far less than his discovery. The significance of all intelligent life, Compared to the planet, it has proved to be a great effect on all the Arcans. This is a small step for Lord Evans, but it is a big step for all our intelligent life. It is a great monument to our exploration of the world and the universe... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news is very praiseworthy, you can hear Heidi and others in the ears but do not feel exaggerated, even if not discovered by their own teachers. For any legendary magician, they will also express their sincere congratulations and be thrilled. I haven't studied arcane profoundly. I have never read the history of the Magic Council. I will never understand how important this discovery is to the Arcans, and what a great meaning it contains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally found the sun, it really has been hidden for a long time..." Ophelia sounded sorrowfully. This has long allowed some of the Arcans to suspect that this is not a real world. It is suspected that this is the "experimental place" of a powerful god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Annick, etc. subconsciously look out the window, the night is like the ink, only the light of the street lights shines from below, in their eyes, this darkness But disappeared without a trace. The clear light illuminates the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ancient magical empire, the "deep darkness" that shrouded in magic was dispelled by the "sun" at this moment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi stood up excitedly and seemed to want to do something, but in the end he stopped with some scruples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, what do you want to do?" Rey Riyak restrained her own trembling. Asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi raised his arm: "I want to cheer, I want to shoot a big fireball into the sky. The sound of the explosion is the horn of our victory!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
