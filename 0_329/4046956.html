			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando waved his hand, not sullen: "There is one, but there is no value, a floating city that can fall from the sky itself can only be a failed work. It will only lead us to the wrong path!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He unceremoniously mocked the legendary magician who built the floating city and thought that he was preaching huge Success only stops above the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floating City" is the research direction of the three magical empire after the development of the peak, they try to live in the sky like the gods, overlooking the common people, but A short-term floating of a city can be achieved, and a long-term, stable state has been difficult to achieve, becoming a problem that all parties want to overcome,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this In the process, many legendary magicians claimed that they had completed the construction of the floating city. So far, there is no floating city in the sky. Some of them just got involved in the Twilight War and became distinct. The target of the attack was destroyed by the church and the nobility coalition, while others had various problems. After a few months, years, or ten years of reluctance, they collapsed or crashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Douglas showed his strength, Roland smiled enthusiastically: "We just found its wreckage, um, it is called 'Aline', The famous "city of the sky", but we lack the core magical structure, there is no way to repair it, only as a secret base."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Douglas didn't care. He smiled and said: "Failed works also have their role. They can remind us of what mistakes should be avoided. I have always been interested in the effects of floating, flying and other spells, and I want to understand the laws and principles they contain. So I hope that the union can let me study 'Alinhe'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, we will propose to the vice president, with your magic level And the merits of the establishment, certainly no problem!" Roland almost patted the chest to guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly knows that there is only one sergeant who will "stop time" in the union, and the other one means the essence of combat effectiveness. And Fernando's proud people appreciate and admire Douglas's ability in mathematics, so he can also grow up to be a strong person who needs to look up and snuggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded. "That troubles, where are we going now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "To go to the headquarters, you have to go to Rentat." Roland showed a meaningful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas slightly stunned: "The city where the Rantham Holm parish headquarters is located?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes. It is also the capital of the Holm Kingdom." Roland nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A carriage drove into Rentent before the gate closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a few streets full of fishy smells, the carriage stopped in front of a seemingly ordinary hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grilled Fish Inn..." Douglas stepped off the carriage and smiled at the weird name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s voice is a bit sharp: “He is good at it and only good at grilling fish. I suggest you come one. Otherwise he will be very angry. I don’t think you know how to cook. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped directly. Splashing water splashes on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the heavy rain, the entire Rantart is full of water, but different from the small city. The roads here are made of stone, not full of sludge, and it looks clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Douglas said with a little emotion: "Rentart is an important city operated by the Empire on the Strait of the Storm, and all aspects have been well constructed. Still occupied by the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born in Antiller, and he felt that he was the empire of the Ilvanas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One day we will be back!" Fernando suppressed the voice and was confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the way, he found that Douglas was very good at getting along. There was no arrogance shared by other teachers. Apart from the problem, there was nothing wrong with it. Therefore, it was relatively less cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hotel is very small and very old, there are not a few tables in the hall, sitting three or four guests sparsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a man with a gray hair standing behind the stage, burying his head in the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't see my fingers, I don't have candles! It's the most disgusting one of all your shortcomings!" Fernando entered the door. Gao accused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the windows in the hotel lobby are very narrow, and the darkness seems to have come early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss raised his head and revealed a square face, his left eye was dead green, murky, lifeless, and it was very shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Saving is a life attitude, you will never understand, the heart is full of blazing rubber." The other eye of the boss is beautiful green Deep and dark, it seems that you can't see the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not angry, turning to Douglas: "Old Green, the owner of this store, an outdated knight, the left eye is the product of blood fusion failure "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this hotel, he does not care about the contraindications that cannot be mentioned, such as magic and blood, but drinks the spirits and eats the grilled fish. The four guests did not react at all, and enjoyed life on their own, as if Fernando’s words were Douglas’s illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Fernando pointed to Douglas: "You can call him Douglas, the guests from across the mainland, want to join us, have passed my test, this is me Give details to Vice President Rieg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew a dark yellow parchment to Old Green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green’s hands are still wiping the glass, but the parchment is flying more slowly, like an animal caught in a swamp, and it is difficult to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing the parchment with a freshly rubbed wine glass, Old Greene said with no expression: "Young people, come honey-roasted fish? This is the entire Lenta Special, the entire Grand Holm area, the best food in the entire Straits territory, you will not regret to taste it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems eager to sell his honey baked fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas got a reminder of Fernando hidden in complaints and satire, smiling: "I am looking forward to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many young people who know how to appreciate now, and some guys simply can't sit down and enjoy the food." Old Green sarcastically said. From the dark door behind the stage to the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an experimental knight secretly cultivated by Fernando's teacher. He has a close relationship with the Hoffenberg family. He is behind his teacher and is unwilling to surrender to the church. The hotel was opened in Renttat as a secret transfer station for unions.” After stopping the carriage, Roland hurried in and introduced Douglas. “Old Green will forward the mission report to Rieger. The vice president will be decided by them. After that, they can enter the headquarters. Don't worry, you definitely have no problem, you can wait for the good news tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Douglas nodded with a smile. "Actually. I am not too worried. The principle of flight and floating is the main direction of my research. But I still have a lot of things to ponder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando's two bright red eyes slammed into Douglas: "What other research do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a discussion between Fernando and Douglas on the way. Mainly focused on mathematical aspects, although he is face to face Straight fooling belittle. However, the heart is paying more and more attention to Douglas's ability. Therefore, after hearing him mention other fields, it is inevitable that he is a bit eager to hear more thought-provoking views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some trivial things." Douglas did not keep secret ideas, opened a chair and sat down, and responded very quickly to Fernando's talent. Young high-level magicians exchanged magical problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
