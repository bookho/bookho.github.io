			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris subconsciously leaned back and worried that he would be washed directly by Raven’s slobber, and smiled a little slyly: “Pull Wendi, calm, calm, I don't mean this. I want to say that the discovery of the elemental cycle law reflects Evans' thinking and inspiration, and not his arcane level is enough to stand at the top of the elemental magic field. The Erm Crown Award is the highest honor of the elemental magic and some do not match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not a Holm royal family and an elemental mage, it is best for Hall The dean of the Royal Devil's Court, another president of the elemental will, is Lavindi. After all, his level of arcane is one level higher than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nine-level arcian, a nine-ring magician, and an authority in the field of elemental magic, Lavin is not as tempered as it is, not as much as the storm master. Overwhelming the strength of all doubts, I have long been able to enter the highest ranking group, so Morris always has some lack of confidence when facing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether he supports Morris’s opinion, he is scared to see him madly roaring, and other high-ranking magicians are open-minded. Smile, so that the saliva wash can not be angered, they have enjoyed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravenly can only look for one thing or identify with a certain arcane knowledge, regardless of whether the person in the opposite debate has a good or bad relationship with himself. It is rumored that he once roared face to face with the storm master for the proof of a certain number theory. Of course, he was slightly less capable and he was pointed out by the storm to prove the loophole and irony him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morris, don't be your miser! The goal of the Holm Crown Award is to recognize 'the breakthrough in the elemental magic field and the ability to be in elemental magic The magician who left the footprint in history, tell me whether the periodic table is the result of the breakthrough of the surname in the elemental magic field. Can Evans be able to leave a footprint in the history of elemental magic? Is Ms. Meredith in the The level of arcane is not enough to stand at the top of the elemental magic field?" Raven is still roaring regardless of Morris' weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being ridiculed by Raven is mainly because he is reluctant to take high-grade materials to refine the seven-level Holm crown ring, Morris faces his The question is that the organization can't afford an effective defense, and keeps his hand in front of his face: "Yes. But the twenty-five Holm Crown Awards, the results of their awards are all opening up a new field or discovering it. A new method, a new theorem, the periodic table seems to be just a summary of a regular surname?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a heartache ring, and he does not admit defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon sees the "war situation" almost, before Raven continues to growl, coughing: "Morris President, the great significance of the periodic table is believed You won't see it. As for whether it is a summary of a regular surname, let us look at the winners of the past: Ms. Meredith won the award for discovering new elements by introducing electrolysis, not currently in Aringe. The president of Donald was awarded for discovering new elements by introducing a method of spectral analysis. The reason they can win the award is what you said, not because of the discovery of new elements, but because of the discovery of new methods, the new elements just prove this. The new method is useful with the accompanying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turning back and looking at the periodic table of elements, we also found two new elements according to the guidance of the periodicity of the elements, that will Is there any problem with the Holm Crown Award for Evans who finds the regularity of the elemental cycle? His arcane rank is the same as that of Ms. Meredith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hey, a hit at the crucial moment Rees words where the flaws, he suddenly speechless, only to look around their own allies. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s allies represented by the committee member Florenza looked at Raven’s slightly red face because of roaring, shaking his head firmly Refused Morris’s help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris raised his right hand and pressed: "Well, I agree to award the Holm Crown Award to Evans. Is there any objection?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is looking around, all elements of the voting will be quietly placed, and several high-level members of the Holm Royal Court are still moving. Dare to raise your hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I announced that the elemental will and the Holm Royal Defence Court unanimously passed the decision to award Mr. Evans the Holm Crown Award." Morris first seriously Said, then the expression is slightly distorted, "Now we should discuss the unique name of Holm Crown Ring and the need for constant magic, it is best to be close to Evans's Periodic Table of the results. As for the style, give it to Flo, who likes to design jewelry styles. Lensa is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florenza is a six-level arcane master, but his magical talent is outstanding. He is now an eight-ring magician. He is good at elements, summons, electromagnetics and force fields. He is said to have a good achievement in the small field of "curse magic". She is less than seventy years old. It was a disciple who was accepted by Maurice after becoming a nine-ring master. In just 30 years, she broke through to the high level and became a member of the Magical Parliamentary Affairs Committee and a member of the Holm Royal Demon Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be seen by his own students, Morris squinted his face: "As the dean of the elemental will, the president of Holm Royal Devils Court, I can't You are free to squander the financial resources of the organization like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you are the opposite, the president of the elemental will, the dean of Holm Royal Devils Court "Florens shaved his mouth and smiled." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris's facial muscles beat a bit: "This is not the point. The point is what word should I use as the name for Evans' ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the Holm Crown Ring is a word, never repeating and trying to match the winner's achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Periodic Table of the Elements, hey, use the word cycle?" Florence is very interested in the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdon touched his white hair and looked at Florence with eccentric yellow eyes: "The concept of cycle is easy with force field, Electromagnetic, dimming, astral systems, and periodic confusion in mathematical foundations are not unique enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about 'foreseeing'?" Arcane Review Committee member Locklin While looking at her black hair on her shoulders, she asked other people's opinions with her pale blue eyes. As a female surname, she was equally interested in the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Arcane Review Committee female surnamed Lidia looks glamorous, seems to have a succulent pedigree, she turns the crystal clear crimson double smirk "Lonnie, you are the name of the 'Arcane Scepter' or 'Silver Medal'. I think it should be named law, which symbolizes the hidden laws between elements."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it does not reflect the characteristics of the field of elements." Florensa did not hesitate to oppose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, these five or six female surnames began a dispute, kept calling and kept being vetoed by others, listening to Morris, Gaston, Orpheus The men and other men were frowning, and they were not good at interrupting their discussion. So they turned their eyes to Lavendi, hoping that he would make a final note. Hey, if Evans found the periodic table, it would be nice to find a new element. You can name it directly with that new element, such as "Gall" named by Woods for his new element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s first half of his eyes seemed to fall asleep. Although he was tempered and violent, he never insisted on the discussion of the ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Morris suddenly dangled a little and knocked on the table: "Just now, Lord Hathaway told me that Holm crown ring uses 'element 'Name because it contains all the elements and the rules between them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florens wanted to say something, but after a while, hold back Yes, Lord Hathaway is still a lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other high-level arcans are silent, using this word to name is truly unique and reflects the characteristics of the elemental magic field, but it is a bit heavy, even redefining The four basic elements of the Arcanist Constantine and the great arcaneist Hathaway who defined and created the modern elemental magic were chased the "Holm Crown Award", their ring name is not "element", one is " The cornerstone, the other is the "creator." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is the proposal of the Archan Master, and it is very appropriate, so Lavin is the first to say: "Use elements, as to what magic effect and seven Level magic, Morris decides when you refine. "You can't let the ladies discuss it anymore." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris is not only the Master of the Elements Department, but the Master of the Alchemy Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is another point, Evans is now a fourth-level arcane master. In a broad sense, he is already a middle-level. I am worried that someone will excuse this, through the business. The committee assigned him a task." Florensa smiled softly. "Although we don't necessarily do this, we can't do it ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Gasdon's hands clasped, silenced, and then said: "Since the arcane level is in the middle, it emphasizes that you can't arrange battles and adventure missions, only research missions. Florensa, you first Arrange a simple research task for Evans to put an end to other people's delusions. Oh, the premise is that he is willing to join our will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the arcane masters shook their heads without hesitation, because Lucien? Evans is about to win the Holm Crown Award and they don't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their students receive the Holm Crown Award, this is something they are teaching and is proud of, and can receive a Holm Crown Award winner. When students, they test their self-esteem, so they simply refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the Holm Crown Award, a total of 25 rings have been issued, six of which are reissued to the Great Arcane in the highest panel Masters and legendary magicians, who have all contributed to the history of elemental magic and live in the world, and there are eight in the remaining nineteen for a variety of reasons in this long 270. Die for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the remaining eleven people is still squatting before the high-level, there are two high-levels that have no big results, and one who likes quiet research and Exploring and refusing to join any organization, the other seven, in addition to Donald, who later entered the top panel, and Morris, who is the president of the branch, became members of the Arcane Review Committee, namely, Lavendi, Gaston, etc. Five people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the winner of the Holm Crown Award may not be able to enter the Arcane Review Committee, but there must be Hall in the Arcane Audit Committee in the name of the elemental field. Crown crown ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gasdonmo licked his left-handed dark blue enamel diamond ring and thought about it: "Look again, Evans’ boldness in the discovery of the periodic table. Hypothesis, careful verification of thinking and firm will, I appreciate it. But he is still young, just started on the road of arcane and magic, the foundation has not been fast, especially the mathematical basis, and which magical faction he is The talent is better yet, so I will observe it for a while and wait until he becomes our disciple, only to find that he can't provide guidance for the corresponding arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mainly still worried about Lucien's arcane potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with Gaston’s opinion, Florenza pays attention when you arrange the research mission." Lavin nodded, "I will also observe His."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the consensus has been reached, we will first congratulate the youngest Holm crown winner in history, Europe, he is not yet twenty One year old!” Morris got up and applauded. “I have to make a ring all night, and the poor element will and the warehouse of Holm Royal Court is empty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien is not yet 19 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Due to the appearance of Lucien, the season of the elemental meeting has been extended a lot. After five days, Saturday evening, Lavindi announced this time. The end of the annual magic meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lavin did not signal everyone to leave, but sighed: "This time the 'Elements and Alchemy Magic Annual Meeting' happened to believe everyone's impression Deep, but the discovery of the periodicity of the elements will surely make this meeting in the history of magic. Therefore, after discussing with Holm Royal Demon Court, we will decide to award the Holm Crown Award to Mr. Lucien Evans. In recognition of his breakthrough surname contribution in the field of elemental magic! Evans, please come on stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry, Timothy and others are slightly surprised to see To Lucien, they were expected to get the Holm Crown Award for Lucien, but I didn’t expect it to come so fast, so direct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien got up, these arcane masters were both happy and emotionally complex for Lucian, and the applause was not crazy but enthusiastic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar saw his friend gracefully and embarrassedly stepped onto the high platform in the applause. He only thought that these two months were like dreams, and that he was just touching Arcane. Lucien, who doesn't know anything about the Magic Council, seems to be coming to the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on the high platform, Lavendi looked at the stairs again: "Please ask the element will president, Holm Royal Devils Court President Morris Hoffenbo Mr. Ge gave Evans an award."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists didn't expect the scene to be so grand, even Lord Morris came, and they cast their eyes on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris took the elemental will, and the rest of the Holm Royal Devils Court came in, then walked alone to the high platform, stood next to Lucien, smiled "Congratulations, Evans. But before giving you the Holm Crown Award, can you tell us what you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
