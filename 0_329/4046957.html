			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stunned and asked a little silly: "Fernando, you haven’t arrived yet, President Rigg..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the words are not finished, he will see Fernando rushing over himself, like a violent hurricane sweeping across the earth, bright red eyes, unabashedly expressing his anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas frowned slightly, then stretched out, didn't say hello to Fernando, just watched him go down the stairs and walked toward the secret room on the ground floor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando!" Roland just woke up and hurriedly shouted, "Don't argue with President Rieg!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando slammed into the door, letting it slammed into the doorframe and isolated everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do? Fernando will anger President Rigg!" Roland believes that he can foresee the next situation and look to Douglas for help. With his strength and demeanor, he can make a dispute come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded. "If there is anything unexpected, I will stop it, but expressing my opinion is Fernando's right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is President Rieg!" Roland couldn't understand Douglas's thoughts. He is a man of great magical power, knowledgeable and amazing in all aspects, and has a keen insight into mathematics, but The way of thinking is weird, not only loves to ask why, but some of the views are really unacceptable, not like the magician with an extremely strict relationship between the upper and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas just smiled, didn't talk, at this time, the sound of Fernando's roar fainted in the lower secret room, a wave higher than a wave. Let Roland suspect that the wall will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened attentively, trying to figure out what Fernando was snarling, but at this time, the secret door opened, and the thin and stern Rigg gloomy face Strode out and climb the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the president of the Pefus County Chapter, I have the right to do this without your old man to judge!" Fernando chased it out, his voice was extremely loud . Full of gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rig’s footsteps. Looking back, the sound seemed to be cold from the depths of the ground: "You are no longer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about it? When I made the decision!" Fernando glared at Rigg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unreasonable mad dog..." Rig snorted and turned and continued to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando waved his arm: "The decaying old guy, even if I am wrong. What does it have to do with Douglas? He just listens to the command of my club president. He simply I don't know the requirements of the headquarters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to them. Roland was stunned. Although he always knew that Fernando had a bad temper and never feared anyone. I like to scream and scream, but I never thought he would be so snarling vice president! This is the vice president! The entire guild is only three! Even if you grow up and argue with them, you will be polite! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was going to stop, but he listened and suddenly understood Fernando’s thoughts. He didn’t feel wronged because he was punished because he made the suggestion. He is ready to be scolded, and at most he plans to argue for it. His anger and incomprehension is why this matter will drag Douglas, so he tries his best to excuse Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Rigg just walked to Douglas, took a breath, turned his head and squeezed a smile without a smile: "Douglas, just forgot I am informing you that as a nine-ring division, you are eligible to participate in the core meeting five days later, so your trip to the 'Aringe' base will be arranged next week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Okay." Douglas did not ask why Rigg would have forgotten it, or why he decided to invite him now, and nodded politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old guy, don't accept Douglas if you have the skills! The more is the organization wants to join the division!" Fernando snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rigg snorted and refused to continue his self-deprecating arbitrage with Fernando. He hurriedly crossed Roland and headed for the old Green room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you guys, this is a time of crisis, and still think about the rights and resources in your hands! I was willing to join the guild, I am optimistic about you. Excluding jealousy, the concept of other organizations and wizards is just and openly integrated. Now, hey! The high-level magician is not lacking in organization!" Fernando did not stop, and roared again against the back of Rigg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s cold sweat is coming down instantly. He has always been an example of President Rieger. He thinks he can understand each other’s ideas, and Fernando’s words are dare to face. Said to export, not afraid to be quietly retaliated afterwards? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, I will pretend not to hear it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rig’s body paused, then paced faster and disappeared around the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, how can you talk like this?" Roland was anxious like an ant on a hot pot. "You are not afraid to be arranged as a seemingly simple but dangerous "Task?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless he can guarantee to kill me once! Otherwise, I will let him understand what is called the storm's anger!" Fernando disdain, " Moreover, he and the president are not so harmonious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is stunned, does his friend seem to be reckless and impulsive, but actually reliant? Is his roar true or is he acting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder you will not be afraid of President Rieg..." he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando yelled: "Is this not to be afraid of anything? Change to be the president, and I am ashamed of him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, or the Fernando I know... Roland doesn’t know if he feels relaxed or sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a deep breath and took care of his hair, then said: "In this era, we may die at any time in the hands of black claw dogs or clergymen. So, don't be afraid to die, this is our common destiny and the final outcome, and if you are not afraid of death, then what are the presidents and vice presidents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Douglas listened quietly to their conversations, and smiled and interjected: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just can't understand their injustice! Fernando looked up at the mottled ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, Douglas and Fernando have not been assigned tasks, Roland Instead, they were sent to do some contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas and Fernando don’t mind this situation, and even feel that they are in line with their own ideas, the two constantly communicate, constantly thinking, and increasingly feel the current The magic system has irreparable flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Fernando has always been in the position of listening and learning. But he is genius. Intuition is sharp, it is mathematical, and it has unusual views on many fields of magic, and occasionally a few words. Both brought new inspiration and ideas to Douglas. So the two are not blindly "teaching." Getting along very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening of the small hotel, the candlelight was dim and the handwriting on the draft paper was blurred. Douglas and Fernando's eyes have solidified different spell effects, and the real darkness can be seen directly, so the two of them casually eat honey and grilled fish while communicating a calculation problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an intermediate master who listened curiously and then quickly walked away with dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the small hotel’s half-covered door was pushed open, and the cool breeze at night blew in, dispelling the thick heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Green, come two honey-baked fish!" The man did not come in, and the voice of the rough hoard was soaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who just came back to sit down, can scream with Fernando’s roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
