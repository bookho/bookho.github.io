			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one talking in the hall of the entire death feast, waiting quietly for what products will be produced in this experiment, and the synthesis of living matter is still how far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of quiet is not difficult, and it is very different from the desperate and oppressive silent scenes under the strong pressure of Felipe. The time seems to have passed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, just as everyone’s eagerly awaited mood was about to turn into a whispering discussion, Lucien on the high platform suddenly chuckled: "Mr. Felipe, you can open the reactor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe opens various protective surnames and sealed alchemy magic according to the rules of normal magic experiments. In order to prevent the products inside from deteriorating due to omissions, it also prevents the spread of highly toxic gases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction furnace slowly opens, because everyone thinks that it is the middle product of the magic experiment, so although it is expected, it is not dignified, and there is no reaction such as holding your breath. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic treatment, the room temperature recovery reactor was covered with a lot of white solid reddish solid particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After loading the pellets into the alchemy vessel, Felipe turned to look at Lucien: "Mr. Professor, what should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Felipe. Don't you check those particles?" Lucien answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe is half doubtful and guessing: "Mr. Professor, what do you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The Necromancers such as Sethi on the high platform are also puzzled. I don’t know why the professor asked Mr. Felipe to check the particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe, as you might guess, our experiment is over. Those particles are the substances contained in the human body." Lucien calmly affirmed the fee. Lipe's guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic experiment is over?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those white particles are living things? ! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The hall suddenly picked up, shocked and stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe's eyes are dead Staring at Lucien, it seems that I am trying to suppress my innumerable emotions. He can't accept the experiment of synthesizing living matter so easily, and the result will be so easy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a while, as the astonishment of the Necromancer and the apprentices reached the climax of the boiling, Felipe finally screamed: "Mr. Professor, you better not tease me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner tension is tight, and I almost think that Felipe will not accept the result of Susie’s sudden shot, control his nervousness and relaxed emotions, still so Responsibly answer: "Mr. Felipe, you can check if I have teased you." It is exactly what you thought of urea! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vocabulary that was passed down from this ancient magical empire was exported. The noisy and noisy voice of the hall was like a sudden drop of water, and it was in a very disturbing and awkward silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Felipe, please check and verify the particles. "Sethi, Tess, and Sidney made a sound at the same time, with fear, fear, expectation, and hope that they could not imagine, as if it were not the substance that the body could excrete, but the taboo that could destroy the whole world."物物.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning ancient Necromancers and growing to the mid-level magician, human life mechanics is an unquestionable truth, they can stand here and have Strong strength is enough to prove its correct surname, but if it is confirmed that it is urea, their outlook on life and world view may collapse, and then doubt the real reason for their advancement.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s gloomy face was rarely an unusually dignified expression. He walked slowly to the alchemy vessel, opened it, and then applied a magical spell to the white reddish particles. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi waited for a few tens of seconds. After he could no longer afford the kind of depression in his heart, he finally asked: "Mr. Felipe, is it really urea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With his voice passing the past, there are nearly a thousand hopes and fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Necromancers and apprentices dare not speak, seemingly worried that their words disturbed Mr. Felipe, causing bad results. Even the results are already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe didn’t hear the inquiry. After a full minute, he slowly and briefly said: “It’s really urea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is quiet again and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was Felipe’s hands-on experiment, no one questioned the professor’s mischief, they looked at themselves desperately, the previous magical learning, analysis and countless experiments, rituals It was a dream, and now it has finally been poked by the cruel reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe suddenly turned his head and said to Lucien: "Mr. Professor, there are occasional mistakes in the identification. In order to be careful, I have to use each Experiments confirm their surnames to finalize the urea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identification is a magic based on its own knowledge, whether it is arcane knowledge, Mystery knowledge, magical common sense, historical classics, or rural rumors are all fundamental to its exertion and effect. Therefore, if there is a mistake or omission in its own knowledge, the identification technique will occasionally make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Felipe’s words, Sethi and others rekindled hope, and it’s seeming that the mistakes in their fundamental ideas have been pushed to the identification mistakes. In the most acceptable direction, no one would like to admit that they are wrong, especially from the beginning, it is fundamentally wrong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life, there is never a lack of such things to evade and fabricate various reasons to deceive yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not seem to care too much: "Mr. Felipe, you are experimenting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Felipe turned around and began to experiment with extreme expressions in a lot of eyes, and Lucien waited quietly beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One magic experiment ended, Felipe's face became more and more gloomy, and the hearts of Sethi, "Fatty" and others became more and more heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the metalware collided with the sound of the alchemy, Felipe lowered his head and carried Lucien, slightly dismayed: "Mr. Professor, indeed It is urea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless dying struggles As the voice sounded, it seemed that there was still a broken world view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidney has no expression on his face, his hands covered with stitching marks, if life mechanics is not true, then why does my body exist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparedly, those apprentices are in a much better state. People like "fat" and "red wine" still have their thoughts and thoughts. "We can't be a formal magician." It seems that the foundation of the Necromancer itself is wrong...so it is not us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is about to open the topic in a certain direction, Felipe, who was not shattered under the shock, became angry and mad, desperate to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, Felipe turned around, his eyes deep and firm: "Mr. Professor, it’s not until you cheered for victory. Because I will never admit that urea is a living matter. It is only a low-lying product excreted by humans, magical creatures or animals. It is a vague substance between living and non-living substances. It cannot be considered as a real living substance. In fact, You still haven't been able to prove that elements or non-living matter can be directly converted into living matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of decades of common sense, he is like defending his territory The beast refuted the professor's experimental results with the best reason he could think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the professor’s strength is mysterious and unpredictable, it is likely to be comparable to himself. Felipe does not mind using violent means to resolve academic disputes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
