			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Downey, Sami, and Jones stood up at the same time, and surprises and suspicions were beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr nodded: "Of course, I will not admit my brother's handwriting and imprint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I mean, is he really sure? Is there any reason why the people behind it are manipulating?" Although Downey knew that Carl's brother should be a big man with the same strength and power, but after all, He doesn't have an intuitive understanding and is concerned with his own life safety. Therefore, he still can't help but ask again and again, and refuses to believe it easily.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl's note in his hand Throw it to Downey: "He can say that he has more than 90% of his grasp. He only shows that this is not a normal dream in the field of illusion, but a thing that involves higher end. It is a specific manipulator. I estimate that he is still investigating this aspect. There is no conclusion for the time being. The only certainty is that the other party is not as strong as we are worried. Therefore, we pretend to forget this matter and secretly observe and wait... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&&  ; Downey looked at the note in the hand, the above content is basically the same as Karl said, of course, certainly not as Karl is so embarrassed, and at the end of the note, there is a black hat-like imprint, seemingly ordinary, but Unique atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s always not safe to be..." Jones whispered to himself, but he had no other way to rush to report the college’s words. In danger. Sami vomited, his right hand reached the left shoulder, patted the ghost that had been languid for a few days, and then yawned, vaguely: "Since Carl My brother said so. Then we should not worry too much about this matter, so sleepy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s facial muscles pumped: “Sami You seem to be too relaxed. At least for now, the real cause of the incident and the behind-the-scenes manipulators have not been investigated. How can we really let go of worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What about that? What can we do? I can only be careful with myself..." Sami is quite a bachelor temperament, taking off his clothes and drilling into the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl's face is smiling, his eyes are shining: "With my brother's attention, there is really nothing to fear. If there is such a nightmare again, we must Be good to explore and take risks..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again showed the feeling of eagerness to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey couldn’t help but secretly believe that he was confident in his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the four people in the 202 bedroom are busy washing ,suddenly. They heard a loud knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey buckled the magic robe under two or three. Turned and walked over. Open the door: "Please... Robert Mentor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Robert Mentor standing in front of the dead man, the dark red in his eyes Needle-like light and a clear blood vessel on the sallow face always make Downey's heart chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he come here personally? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert looks terrible, but the voice is mellow and gentle: "I just passed the 'Tower of Life'. So I will inform you by the way, I don't know if you are willing or not. Join the 'Genetic Laboratory Heidler Branch' and become an apprentice-level assistant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What genetic laboratory Heidele branch? Is it Mr. Felipe them? Institutes established in the college? Are you including Donnie, I, Sami and Jones? Or only a few of them? Mr. Robert, I really like to study genetic factors and have a good accumulation in this area..." Carl took the toothbrush and rushed out with a white foam in his mouth, and a series of questions and confession blurted out. At this time, the apprentices who were going to the teaching tower noticed that Robert, who had a special appearance, stopped in the vicinity and looked at Tang with surprise and sorrow. Nie et al., Genetics Laboratory Heidler Branch? is this real? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey, Sami, and Jones were shocked to say nothing, squeezing at the door, staring at Robert, waiting for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he added: "This includes Carl, Downey and Jones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices around are waking up and giving a burst of coolness. The sound is actually the genetic laboratory Heidler branch! Really studying with Mr. Felipe! Why are they selected? Why not yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed, stunned and stunned, many apprentices secretly regretted, knowing that when they opened the class that day, they also learned how to ask for a question like Karl. Mr. Felipe made an impression that the special appearance of Carl made him famous in the "Tower of Life". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Downey and Jones couldn’t believe it again, and Sami suddenly bowed his head, and he was an apprentice in the soul direction. , which will be picked up by the genetic laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert gently decapitated: "What is this thing to lie to you? Mr. Felipe is impressed by you because he praises one sentence: I don't ask why the Arcanist is not a qualified Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a statement that the Douglas Speaker once said, all the apprentices present are clear, now I heard again, regretting that the mice bite their hearts, they should not be shy, fear and other emotions bound the question! Be sure to ask why in the future! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, it’s great! Thank you, Robert Mentor..." Downey said with excitement, although Mr. Felipe asked directly, but Thanks to the recommendation of the instructor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones stood there, with a dull smile on his face, like entering his "field", this surprise is really too sudden There is no psychological preparation at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robo has nodded and still has no expression: "It seems that you are willing, then wait until I come to my office, I will bring you 'laboratory branch' Report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Robert Instructor, what do we do as an apprentice assistant? Assist in the production of experimental materials? Make observations of the cultivated creatures and give them Feeding? Or directly to help observe? Use the knowledge of magic crystallography to analyze..." After seeing more people, Karl quietly put the toothbrush down and removed the foam in his mouth. He is an elegant gentleman who pays great attention to instrumentation and etiquette! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be people telling you at the time." Robert's face moved, ignoring Karl's problem like a rainstorm, and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great!" Until Robert went away, Jones came back and shook his arms hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lift descended to the hall, it did not stop, but pan There was a pale glow, connected to the instructor's coat of arms on Robert's chest, and then it continued to fall, and the surroundings were dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is the lab underground?" Carl was excited and curiously left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie turned his head, a pair did not know his appearance, although his appearance was quiet and gentle, like a quiet lake, but actually like a Kitten with claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert does not squint and turns a deaf ear to Karl’s constant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the lift stopped, the pale light curtain opened, and a silver-gray metal fusiform item appeared in front, and Robert took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to sit on the ground shuttle?" Carl asked happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Donnie and Jones have not seen such items, and are a bit uneasy, but fortunately there is an "introduction" by Karl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Robert nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground shuttle is closed and moves quickly along the tunnel. After two or three minutes, it slowly stops, and the left side is a silver and white Metal gates, cold and indifferent, very stylish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert took out a strange badge and shook it. The door retreated to both sides, revealing a wall like the orange honeycomb. It is unique and shocking. Even Carl was subconsciously stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
