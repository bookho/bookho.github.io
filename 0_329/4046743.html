			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [Www.biquwo.com], this site provides you with free novels for free reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun through the bloody dust It seems that dark red has no temperature, but in fact its burning is more exaggerated than the main material world. In addition, the temperature of the air is more than sixty, even if there are not many curses and toxins. Pervasive, ordinary humans can't survive in such an environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver-gray glint flashed out in the shape of a crescent, and disappeared instantly. Only the illusory and creaking gap seemed to be worn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of demons led by the six-armed serpent-shaped demon suddenly stopped at the same place, as if they were surrounded by "time stop", one After a second, their bodies suddenly exploded, turning into a bloody sky, and the pieces of the body fell like raindrops, trivial and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are getting better and better at the power of the legendary 'Sword of Truth'." Seeing this scene, Lucien did not praise his own praise. Natasha did not use the epic sword "Sword of Truth" at this time, but clasped "Pale Justice" and fully tempered his mastery of blood power by killing the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is very emotional and happy: "I am not a brave knight. I have always mastered my strength very well, especially After three years in the bottom of the monastery after being promoted to the Knights of the Knights, I really grasped my will and body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She accepted it without shame Lucian’s praise, followed by a little regret: “Unfortunately, only the high-level devils encountered on this road, not the demon king, even the small lords such as the demon duke did not see, unable to fully exert their strength. The place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every layer of the abyss can support a demon king at most, that is, if a demon duke can not control his own plane In most areas, it is impossible to get the feedback of the 'Abyss', and thus promoted to the legendary king.” Lucien smiled for Natasha, although she had to supplement the knowledge of the abyss before coming. But it’s still a long way from Lucien, "The Devil" The basic subject of every magician, "So, unless there is any joint action, we can meet the bloody king at the top of the Scarlet Plain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the abyss inside. In addition to a few special demons such as "the Lord of Undead" and "The Dark Lord", most of the demon kings also have no name, only the code of the main material world is given to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And among the abyss, there are quite a few kings currently known. It is three times that of the nine layers of hell. A total of twenty-eight. But just as no one knows exactly how many layers of the abyss are, there are several devils of legendary ranks. Even the "observer" Rhein, a vampire prince who doesn't know how many years have lived, is not sure. The name of the "Endless Abyss". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, because they are chaotically killing each other, they are promoted by defeating and absorbing other kings, so the overall strength of the abyss is not as good as the hell of only nine devils." After the fall of the Duke of Frost and the Lord of Silver and White, the dead hell was revived a few years ago, and a legendary demon was appointed as the new "Frost Duke" by Hell Lord, through Hell. The Lord's approval, it received the feedback and blessing of the half-plane strength of Silent Hell, and quickly rose from the legendary first order to the legendary second order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new "Duke of Frost" is said to be very embarrassing and good at fraud, so there is a title "The Lord of Secrets." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s good to meet the bloody king!" Natasha is eager to fight, but she does not want to be in danger of her and her husband falling into the joint action of the demon king. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario is surrounded by green light, as if growing out of countless green plants, fresh and natural, in stark contrast to the harsh environment around him, he is watching Around, the prevention was sneaked by the demon king, completely ignoring the "outing" scene of Lucian and Natasha talking and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien constantly adjusts the direction of progress based on the feedback of astrology, the mirror of destiny, etc. Suddenly, the picture inside the crystal ball becomes clear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody earthen walls around the altar are engraved with a complex three-dimensional pattern, which makes people can't help but desire to rush, and they are eager to kill. These patterns spread from the altar to the surroundings, seemingly connected to the entire Scarlet Plain, and above the altar, they were filled with a vibrant green light, as if the world inside was similar to Stroop Forest. The natural environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the giant stone array, there is a bloody fortress, the hard walls are made of corpses of different races, and the heart and intestines are faintly visible. , head and other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the bloody king of the bloody king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of the thing seems to be really here..." Looking at the crystal ball, Lucien was slightly surprised. "Is it too smooth for progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding the origin of the expansion of the abyss, Malfurion never had the reluctance to come in, but looked at the crystal ball with deep gaze: "We sneak past the probe If you solve the problem as soon as possible, we will solve it as soon as possible. If the enemy is strong, we will quit and summon enough legends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful in ambush, things are too simple and smooth ..." Natasha said with a smile that was happy before the battle, very solemnly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is also in line with the fact that the demons are difficult to arrange complex plots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earthy platform resembling an altar is very wide and lush The forest exudes a fresh taste, and there are faint green things surrounded by green spots in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the green things, a huge demon covered with tiny blood-colored scales is pacing back and forth, and the wings behind it are entwined with the burning glow of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most special thing about it is that it has two heads, one is like a bad dog, but it has two sheep-like corners, and the other is like a human face. goat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, I hate this environment the most! Damn, I want to ruin it!" The dog's head shouted loudly, and the golden eyes were full. The mood of confusion and destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human face of the goat’s head snorted: “I can’t stand this time, even normal thinking can’t be done. No wonder you have been suppressed by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will kill you someday!" The dog's head jerked forward, his mouth opened, and White's teeth were exposed, biting at himself. Another head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human face goat slightly flickers, as if you are used to this "self-killing" situation: "You are a low-energy guy with no brain, you want Do you want to accept the punishment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog’s head slammed and slammed: “What is the plan? It’s better to kill directly.” In the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no re-construction, the obedience to the superior is the embodiment of the devil's bullying and fear. If the superiority can't suppress the demons below, the devil does not mind betrayal. And killing, in fact, when they are chaotic to the extreme, they often ignore the gap in strength and attempt to overthrow the superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The plan tells you what is the use? Can you understand?" The human face goat whispered, "We are waiting here anyway, waiting for the Magic Council and When the elves' investigators arrive, they will conduct a 'fierce battle' and then 'fail' to escape, leaving them to them and leaving 'clues' to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not kill them?" The dog's head is incredible. "What's the point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Scarlet Plain, it feels that it can deal with it. Malfurion, as for who is coming from the Magic Council, it doesn't care! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, you must fail!" The human face goat is too lazy to argue with this idiot. For tens of thousands of years, this is because the bastard has dragged his legs and he has always been Can't go any further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it also believes that in the bloody plains, even if Douglas and Agraia come, they can escape the abyss. A few people, no one likes to collect intelligence, fully learn their gods. (To be continued...)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
