			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the castle, Lucien saw Joanna coming out of the corridor next to her with a huge sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evans, the corpse in the castle lost control after the evil Necromancer was killed by you, but we have cleaned it up. Joanna’s low-browed eyes looked like a respectful report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her heart, in addition to the fear and admiration of the power of Lucian Knight, there is still a lot of dissatisfaction. His powerful paladin hired himself and other adventurer squads to protect the apparently to confuse the sights, smashed the Baron Habero and the Necromancer to investigate and raid. In this way, he and his husband and sister had to be involved in the battle between the strong and weak, and almost killed by the damn, horrible owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around and asked calmly: "Is there a living person in the castle? Simon, Betty, Wise and Mars, where are they?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna is not a girl like Betty, mature, even if she is dissatisfied, she is very serious in answering the question of the Paladin. Mr. Mars, there were no living people in the castle, and they were all made into dead bodies by the Necromancer. Simon found that there was a disturbance in the foggy town, and he rushed to deal with it. He suspected that there were a small number of dead bodies that did not escape; Mr. Wise and Mr. Mars have been hiding in the storage room and dare not come out; Betty vomits in the bathroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"vomiting?" Lucien held his hand in the left hand material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna’s glamorous face also showed a disgusting expression: “Before dealing with the corpse, Betty found the material of the dinner we are about to enjoy in the kitchen. They are all rotten human meat, with eyes, tongues, fingers, and white worms..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She is vomiting, and the scene is obviously unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, it seems that the Baron is prepared to use rot and corpse in food to make it easier to deal with himself, Karin's death, those materials are lost in a glamorous appearance: "Ms. Joanna, you don't have to call me an adult, just call me Mr. Evans, I don't have a title and title."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna looked up in a slightly puzzled way, just to see the deep and charming eyes of Lucien, the whole person immediately fell into a vast and dreamy starry sky, unable to extricate himself, eyes blurred and admired: "OK Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly asked her about the memory of the previous battle and found that there was no problem after using hypnotism to not cause Joanna In the case of a rebound, the details were slightly modified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no problem, Joanna, you go to the fog town to help Simon deal with it, lest he be in danger." Lucien lifted the charm Humanity". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna was suddenly awake, her cheeks flushed, and she just stared at Mr. Evans, feeling that he was full of charm, it was too shameful, like a Adult girl! However, with Mr. Evans' strong strength, handsome appearance, elegant conversation, and gentle attitude, every woman will think that he has charm, as long as he maintains an appreciation attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, I will go to the foggy town immediately." She felt her face hot, so she quickly walked outside the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly watched Joanna leave, then turned and looked for opportunities to deal with the small details of Betty, Wise and Mars and the inside of the Baron’s room. A small amount of battle marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The dimly lit candlelight swayed in the bedroom, and Lucien looked at Simon, Joanna and Betty in front of him: "Thank you for the fog." The town’s law and order is maintained, and thank you for helping me in the battle. The property in the castle of Baron Habero, according to the adventurer’s agreement, you can get one tenth, and the rest will be one third of me. I have to hand it over to the Viscount Stanley and the church. You lock the room and don't give the thief a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wants to maintain the bright future Identity, so in order not to cause doubts from the church and the nobility, the property of Baron Habero was not exhausted, as a normal treatment after a passing knight accidentally encountered such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocrats in the south-central countries of the continent, except for the top of the top, are hard to get at least one or two magical or magical items like Aalto's noble and wealthy aristocrats. Therefore, the title of the most barren land in the mainland is very appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the only set of extraordinary armor of Baron Habero was paid to Hunter as a reward, and then mortgaged by Hunter to buy materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we take twenty Jintales?" Simon’s so smart and steady man couldn’t help but swallow a saliva, because one tenth of the property Not only one tenth of the coin, but also the discount of the extraordinary sword. Only aristocratic things like castles, territories, and manors are not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucien’s common sense from Natasha, in Aalto, the apprentice’s extraordinary items are probably within ten Quintals, low-level items. (Level 1 and Level 2) tens to hundreds of Jintales, medium-level items (3rd, 4th, and 5th) are thousands to tens of thousands of Quintal, and the extraordinary items above it. It is difficult to calculate with money. It is a direct exchange of materials, articles, territories, ports, cities, pharmaceuticals, and knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the extraordinary items have always been priceless, not only rare, but also did not enter the magic circle, aristocratic circles, etc., can not buy with Jintal. If Natasha didn’t know that Lucien had the strength of the Cavaliers, he wouldn’t tell him about it. For example, Victor’s income in the past was around one hundred Jintales, but he even had an extraordinary item. No touches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This two-handed sword is a second-class super-article that allows the user's strength to approach the third-level knight, crushing the enemy like a boulder. There are certain requirements, but the value is not expensive in one hundred and forty Jintales." Lucien was originally prepared to make up the Jintal, picking up this two-level two-handed sword, but it needs the strength of the official knight to take So I have to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien also felt that he did not have the opportunity to get the "boulder" for Baron Habero, otherwise things would be more troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sis, Joanna and Betty, after hearing the words of Lucien, looked at the pile of Jintale on the table, and looked a little excited. Even if they have hiring tasks every day, three people don't eat or drink together, and only ten Jintales a year. If you want to really get rid of twenty, you need at least four or five years of difficult adventures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Mr. Evans, actually we didn't have much effort." Joanna was modest, then she was afraid that Lucien would rush in regret. "But we all need money for regular knight training, especially Betty can't delay any more, so I can only accept it with a thick face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw them Put away Jintale, put the rest into his own purse, and then smiled: "Before Coser City, I will guide Betty to do some regular knight training, huh, the arrow was too timely. You can also follow along."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Lucien is indeed grateful, and on the other hand, when they are asked by the church, The fact that you can carry out regular knight training can be known to the church, and the evidence on the side is more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Betty’s excited expression, knowing that Coser City’s coaching of the Cavaliers is close to the bankrupt aristocrats, they have not stimulated the blood. Power, which is comparable to the powerful Paladin guide like Mr. Evans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna and Simon also thanked each other: "Thank you very much, Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luisen waved his hand: "I am not a paladin, nor a nobleman. It is only a quasi-knight of His Royal Highness. Because there are many magical and magical items on the body, it seems to be powerful. You should not preach everywhere. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Joanna answered them, Lucien said again: "Right, I was rotted and dying in the battle with the Necromancer." Erosion, injury is not light, need to rest quietly tonight to recover, you do not bother to disturb me. And under such a injury, I can not rush to the wolf town to report to the church in advance, can only ask you to stay up tonight tonight, everyone together tomorrow morning Departure to the Wild Wolf Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wild Wolf Town is the next town on this route, also belonging to Baron Habero, but within the town church The trainee pastor should not have been refining the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Evans." It is also a generous money reward, and a commitment to regular knight training. Simon, Joanna and Betty are no longer hidden. Dissatisfied, very excited and happy to answer in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
