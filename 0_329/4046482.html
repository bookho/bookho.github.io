			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lance, in the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the slight vibration of the world, all the Cardinal members have noticed anomalies, and the sun is shining in the sky, and the cloudless sky is looming. A huge world scene, it is so strange, so familiar, it is the same space that I have been searching for more than three years, Silver Moon Etna and mysterious existence of the different space of falling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know who discovered it first... This world seems a bit special, the movement is too big, so we can also pinpoint it... again Fair competition.” Another “Saint” of the Cardinal Mission, Anasta, squinted and broke the brief solidification in the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Cardinal Mission have turned their attention to the Pope, is the plan to continue the full battle with the Magic Council before, or to re-arrange, all in this different space Mainly to find the fall of the injured Aitna and mysterious existence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the deep gaze of the two cardinal members, they can’t see any emotions, others are slightly excited. For them, if they want to choose, There is no doubt that the latter is chosen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Lucien important? Of course important! Frequently put forward a new theory against the gods and church prestige, it is very likely that in the 30s and 40s, he will become the legendary magician, and if he let him grow, he will not mention the worst consequences of his continued breakthrough in the field of creation. It’s just that in the future, it’s not too small to be the next Douglas, the next Brooke is alert, no one wants more than one ill-intentioned, and wants to destroy but can only slowly plot the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with Silver Moon, the mysterious existence, and the secrets of Him, Lucien’s important surnames are pale and weak, if they are caught To understand the secrets of their existence, that is to the church, to the pope, to yourself and so on, and that is a huge harvest that has never been seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which pope does not want to be like the real "genus" Etna? "Silver moon does not fall, Luna is not dead"? But they are limited by the source of their own strength is the "God of Truth", can not rely on magic and medicine to continue life, can only live as four or five hundred years old like ordinary legend, and seems to become a pope, but also because of the "truth" The power of the god or other complicated reasons is much shorter than the normal legend, even if he is on the throne of the pope, he is already a saint! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the short-lived pope, the members of the cardinal group who are interested can not notice, but what is the real reason, they can only guess, the pope The body of the mortal bears the power of the true God and forcibly ascends to the level of “genuine”, and both the body and the soul are irreparably wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, insight into the mystery of a true "genuine" will surely give the Pope a longer life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while waiting for someone to share some benefits in this matter, there is a great hope to break through the current standards, and maybe there is hope for "genuine" to become "Saints" or "desert angels" who are always in the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the church, if the Pope and himself and others are promoted, it is the benefit of the whole church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bit of a burning eye between the twins. The pope sighed slightly and calmly said: "This time I should purify the '堕天使' road. Sean Evans, but the Lord has given us even more severe and dangerous tasks. This is our privilege and our glory. You are still the Cardinal of Holm Parish, commanding the five parishes, and magic. The parliament is contending, but there will be no reinforcements until the end of this matter, so you have to maintain the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your command is the will of the Lord, the truth Forever." Thrad did not respond with emotional fluctuations, but in the eyes of other cardinal members, he was really bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the head of the five major parishes, becoming the real power in the church after the Pope’s majesty, every saint, every pastor of the Holy Spirit Pursuit, but the Magic Council is definitely not the magical empire that decayed and decayed in the past. This position itself means great risks, and most importantly, he lost the opportunity to go to the mysterious space to find Silver Moon Etna. Obviously not worth the candle, but since Thrad himself did not protest, they are also happy to have one competitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anasta, Maria, you follow me." Pope Benedict II quietly told Maria that another is " The saints, like Anasta, are his ties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does His Majesty pay more attention to this matter than we imagined? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Azzaro, Valenhill, Beria..." The Pope ordered five members of the Cardinal, a pastor of the Holy Spirit, and an epic knight. All are legendary powerhouses, "You follow me as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the greatest power that the Southern Church can draw without affecting defense and confrontation. Who told them that their enemies are the most, even if the Pope believes that other forces will not give up the mystery of "classes of God", nor dare to be too big, if any strong can abandon their greed, and most of the church When the strong ones go to the mysterious space and lead their own forces to suddenly launch an attack, then things are in trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he personally shot, the Pope is very confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manpower was mobilized, and the Pope continued to command: "The high-ranking clergymen, the night watchers are ranked in the top two hundred, the national knights and above are ready, maybe this The world is too special, as vast as a tomb, so you have to rely on people to spread the net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The execution of Lucien Evans Also try to draw two or three high-ranking vigils to complete."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, he still remembers to kill Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to follow the Order of the Pope." The Cardinal Missionary replied in Qi Qi, and then painted the cross on the chest, "On the truth forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the starry sky, Oliver spread his hand: "This is the space It’s a bit weird, it’s too big, maybe the North and South churches will come soon. I’ll go ahead and see, you go back and tell the speaker the previous information, let him make proper arrangements and manpower.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The beautiful Hathaway has no extra words, and turns to locate his "Elemental Paradise" and jump back. A few hours ago, she got Fernando's "secret letter", knowing that Lucien proposed "new alchemy" and rebuilt the elements and alchemy system, so she took the initiative to put up her greed and applied for the next five years. Lin Er, to improve and absorb this theory by digesting and absorbing, so as to improve itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver looked at Hathaway disappeared in place, sighed softly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaos Started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Plateau", a bustling city Among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is full of ancient style, with heavy stone houses in the era of steam civilization, and green trees in the era of elves, and more The roof is pointed, gloomy and ancient. Come and go, there are people of all kinds of skin color, hair color, and ochre, as well as wolves with long fangs, delicate and delicate elves, elegant pale vampires, full-scale fish scales, and so on, as if gathered Started all races in the world. [br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, these intelligent lives are broken like mirrors, and the two humans who are just chatting happily look at each other and become pieces of debris. The surrounding buildings, and even the entire city, are swaying and the fog disappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dark castle in the ground, a huge coffin in the castle jerked open, a black night dress, black cloak The man in his thirties floated out, his eyes were bright red, full of enchanting beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it finally found?" Dracula disappeared in place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the night plateau, several vampire princes have made a similar reaction, completely do not care about being taken into the ground, there is no more important thing than the first ancestor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In St. Ivan, in Antwerp, in the dark mountains, don’t know how many legendary strongmen look up at the sky, then go alone or mobilize people No one resists this temptation, even if he is proud of Rudolph II, mysterious as the Pope of the North, there is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
