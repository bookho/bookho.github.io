			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is a glimpse first, then tastes the deep meaning from Fernando’s words: "Teacher, you are saying that even if the plan is still preparing, it has not yet begun. Implementation, the legendary strong can also sense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too exaggerated, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien’s current authority, you can redeem most of the information below the legend in the High Arcane Library. The understanding of the legendary field is limited to The promotion of the two legendary professions in the book of the Astrology and Elements, the construction of the corresponding legendary magic, and the occasional retelling of the teacher Fernando, the more complete, more specific, more subtle, and more systematic legendary knowledge is slightly equal to zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien is inevitably surprised by this near-spiritual hunch, although in the formal magician, he relies on the fate of the main star to be dangerous. The decisiveness and decisiveness of action prevented the Baron Habero from plotting against his life, but at that time Baron Habero had begun to officially implement the plan, and both sides were in a castle, and it was not surprising that they could pre-warn in advance. Just a few minutes ago, I just straightened out the plan in my heart. I didn’t even have time to explain to the teacher that the dead soul dominated the danger in advance. It’s really unbelievable to start with a strong “abandonment and maintenance”. Fernando said with a face: "The promotion of legend is the qualitative change of life. In the early days of the Twilight War, in the propaganda of various churches, the legend is equal to the demigod. If your plan can really threaten Vicente's life, then a small change in his fate trajectory can be amplified into a very dangerous signal in his cognitive world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp When it comes to this, Fernando has paused, and seems to be looking for good examples to avoid the ignorance of the legendary strongman when he went out to explore: "You used to save the 'observer' and design When dealing with the vampire prince Dracula, have you ever thought about killing him, is there a real plan that can make him fall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Sean shook his head in a dignified manner. From the beginning, he was trying to save the Rhine. He had nothing to do with Prince Dracula. If he had a conflict of interest with Rheinland, he didn’t have to take such a big risk. Please Natasha lead him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of his legendary peak, if you want to design and kill him, unless you want to move Douglas and Brick to join your own teacher, the situation at that time is fundamental. Not allowed, and even Natasha proposed to tell Thrad that the plan to set up a trap to ambush him was vetoed by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien suddenly realized the arrangement of the Rhine until he summoned the mysterious existence of the god of the silver moon, Aitna, and the world of the dead. Really understand what he is dealing with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the tomb of the Sphinx, the underground palace of the Sun King, and the altar of the fisherman, he only knows that he is helping him out of trouble and eliminating the changes in the realm of the dead. In the specific case, he never elaborated. This is obviously a dangerous premonition to avoid the mysterious existence of the dead spirit, and he has not completely awakened, and finally concealed the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the legends of the previous dealings: the king of nightmare is "self-death", which leads to the mathematical problem in the depths of his memory; the king of the Sphinx Kesi was imprisoned, half-life and half-dead, in a state of embarrassment; for Sarder, he only confirmed his surprise, and he used his hand to remove the clown, and did not really want to deal with him; and the teacher, the Speaker of the House, and other legendary magicians, When you throw out the subversion of the paper, you will repeatedly evaluate and pave the way to prevent too much impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s attitude is dignified, thoughtfully, Fernando knows that he has this vigilance and gently nods: “Get this in the future. Intelligence, don't go to the plan first, hand it over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be a little worried, once again swearing: "But, subversion of the paper and This danger is different and must be reviewed and laid out.” He always felt that Lucien was the kind of guy who could make a subversive surname at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The legendary hunch is not in danger of subverting the surname paper?" Lucien asked in confusion, which was different from what he had just thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando glared at the bright red eyes: "The cognitive world is semi-cured, blending the soul, and in the light of the relationship between illusion and reality, it begins to interact with the real world and the destiny of the stars. The essential changes of the legendary magician, coupled with the reflection of the fate of the main star, the legendary level of the analogy of the magical class, the formation of the legendary Master's ability to predict the danger, and if the subversion of the thesis can be dangerous to the legend, then no doubt is with him The main components of the cognitive world are completely contradictory. In other words, his cognitive world does not recognize the existence of this research, and naturally it is not dangerous that they cannot be sensed in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are stared by an archaeologist, it is much more horrible than the legendary powers of Prince Dracula and Rudolf II. After all, the Arcane Masters are more diverse, especially one who is good at necromancer, curse, The great arcian who transformed life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s mouth curled up and smiled and said: “You forgot the identity of your own fate? The prediction of Vicente’s prophecy is likely to be on my body. We must know that this kind of premonition is illusory, our relationship is quite close, and your plan implementation must be presided over by me. Therefore, you don’t have to worry that Vicente will go back to you. Lippe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really biased... Lucien is still worried and asks: "Teacher, isn't the soul of the dead soul hate you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have a hate, hate, I am still afraid of him?" Fernando glanced. "Okay, go back, we have to hold the highest review group meeting to discuss this." Something happened, and then I have to 'interrogate' the undead in the black and white world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know what they are different about?" Lucien was curious Authentic, don't know if they have plans to deal with themselves, such as silly in the cave of the dwarf's remains The high-ranking undead who was killed by himself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando put his face on the board: "If it suits you, it belongs to your scope of authority, I will naturally Tell you, though, after Vicente's hand, we can 'interrogate' the true memory, mostly the memory he wants us to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien suddenly remembered that the soul of the dead, Vicente, is also the "chief expert" in the field of brain and soul memory. Except for the brains of the octopus heads who like to play with the soul in the dark mountains, I am afraid there is nothing in this field. Comparing with him, what invades the brain, looks at memories, deletes memories, tampers memories, and weaves memories, all of which are his masterpieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, Fernando, etc. can naturally distinguish which are false memories, and can not find which part of the memory is deleted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original undead in the dead world wanted to provoke the parliament from me. Guilty, if it wasn't for Felipe's reminder, things would probably become very troublesome..." Lucien sat in the office of the Institute of Atomic Research, watching the results of the interrogation after the teacher Fernando screened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Felipe’s anti-water, there is no plan for himself. Without his own plan, the soul of the dead dominates Vicente and naturally does not realize the danger. The conspiracy of Seoul is likely to succeed in the current "Pore Wars" of the parliament. The most troublesome thing is self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the future, whoever dares to provoke "academic guilt" from himself will be considered by the highest appraisal group to be speculative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general situation about the deceased world is more detailed than I know, and there is a clear reminder of the dangers in the depths, especially from the memory of the undead Ador The deepest scene taken out is to make all the members of the highest panel judged to vibrate..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the specific scene, it does not belong to the scope of the permission of Lucien, Unable to know, but the consequences of this scene, Fernando is very clear, that is, the parliament decided to develop the magic of exploring the gap entrance of the Necromancer according to the memory and traits of the high-order undead, and then establish a "forward exploration" at the entrance of the gap. "Standing", slowly explore, never rush into the depths, waiting to find the mysterious existence of the dead world and the new world of the fall of the moon god Aitna, get his fragments, study the results, and go deep into the realm of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the ruler of the dead has not attached to the spirit world, tempting the legendary magicians to explore the deep thoughts...but there is no Lord Maskillen, Rheinland The information that Mr. and other legendary magicians are trapped in the depths of the dead spirit is that the undead Ador is still not in contact with this level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi'an doubts Thinking about it, I originally planned to "suddenly realize" in front of the teacher Fernando. It turned out that the Rhine was trapped in the depths of the dead spirit by Prince Dracula, but now it is not necessary to cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next interrogation results made Lucine almost laughed out, and the guilt of the pale hands was provoked by the undead in the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul of the dead knows that it will not be too light, but it is also sure that the undead in the dead world is insulting. Well, the parliament is alert.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
