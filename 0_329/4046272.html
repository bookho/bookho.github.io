			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene seems to be stagnant for a few seconds, and even the cold wind that has been scraped seems to have solidified in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caliline and the waiters not far from the side looked at the winter bear and rushed to the front, then after a sword flashed At an unstoppable speed, it falls to the ground and ignites the long-lasting snow and fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mature winter bear with a knight strength is so simple to kill the drama? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter bears from the forehead, nose, mouth to the body, highlighting a deep blood line, but no drop of blood flows out, all frozen into a shimmering blue light Ice layer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light gray mysterious glow then erupted from it. When the light subsided, the winter bear disappeared, and a man in a black cloak appeared. His face and cloak were split into two halves under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its vitality is tenacious, it is still twisting on the ground, not being killed by a sword, but if it is not treated in time, it can be thought of a few minutes later. His end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When encountering an enemy attack, Lucien was always awkward and accurate, and would not stay at all. If it is a real winter bear, it has already died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a druid? Or an ancient heritage magician of the changing system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut Turning a winter bear reveals a person, and even though Lucien is good at keeping calm, he can't help but be a little surprised. When I recalled the feeling of undulation when the light gray light appeared, I was initially confirmed as a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I understood the purpose and plan of this guy, Lucien would not be able to save him in the eyes of the same magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black man who was lying on the floor for a few seconds, and Carlylea made a sharp cry as she just woke up from her nightmare: "There are assassins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall, undulating snow on the tall coniferous trees was shaken by her loud screams, scattered to the young nobles who hunted the precious animals They rushed back in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Carlylena’s face became pale and she was so frightened that her body was soft and she had to go down to the dragon and the horse was in the right direction. Lucien beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression is unchanged, the right hand “frost” is still tightly sheathed, it seems to be able to pull out again at any time, and the left hand politely holds Kali Linna's shoulders, let her sit firmly, and then "care" asked: "Beauty Baron, are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, I don't think there is The assassin came to kill me. Thank you, Mr. Peter. If you didn't have me, I might have died...” Carlylena looked very weak, like a white flower that was pitiful. After stabilizing her body with the help of Lucien, her hands wrapped around Lucien’s left hand, and the abundance of the body leaned back, as if seeking for security and protection. The strong mature woman’s sweet and fragrant cosmetics lingered on the road. Sean nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s nose twitched twice, not too accustomed to this sweetness, subconsciously want to cast “air filter bubble”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden occurrence of the incident, plus the suspicion of the Baroness Carlyle because of Sergey, Lucien has no feeling of beauty The left hand forced the Carlylea away: "The Baroness, you are fine, there may be other assassins, the danger has not been lifted, you should not interfere with my warning."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina is trying to push the towering chest to Lucien’s arm, but it’s just empty when it’s hard, and then Lu’s words seem to echo in her mind. : "Do not interfere with my warning, do not interfere with me, do not interfere with me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Mr. Peter. You are really brave and cautious. Knight." The charm was ignored. Carlyina seemed to have forgotten a few fears and frights. Silver teeth answered with a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Carlylena’s maid urged the horse to catch up with Carlyle, and the attendants surrounded her to guard against other possibilities. Assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the order, the female baron adults." Several attendants came to the black man, some took out the standard banned ropes, and some took out the therapeutic agents, and soon tied the work and tied him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ball Shaq and other young nobles just came back to see this scene, hurriedly and caringly asked: "Calilina, how are you? No injuries "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pale face brings out the different pitiful feelings of the past, so that these young nobles can't wait to take her into their arms and take good care of them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calenina just smiled and said: "I'm fine, the assassin has been subdued by Mr. Peter. I don't think he is a formal knight, he will be an assassin with a sword. The winter bear is defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, her eyes flashed and sneaked into Lucien, her face faintly faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolshak saw the appearance of Carlyle, the fire in his heart ignited, hatefully slammed Lucien, and the left hand held the right hand skin. Gloves, it seems to be taken off and thrown in the snow to ask for a duel, but he immediately returned to the smell, horrified: "Peter is he is a formal knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the probability of stimulating the blood is higher than in other countries, the Cavaliers are still the ranks of many young aristocrats. The 24-year-old Balsac has set himself the goal of becoming a knight before the age of thirty. And if you can get Caliliana and her wealth, even if it can't be successful, you can buy secret medicine from the smuggling channel to stimulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Magic Council, the blood stimulating agent plus blood purifying agent, worth about five hundred Quintal, can go to the Shahran Empire, to many In the mainland countries, small and medium-sized aristocrats who cannot rely on themselves to stimulate blood and not have family secret agents like the big nobility are often willing to spend thousands or even tens of thousands of coins to obtain. Except for the nobility, no one can understand the aristocracy's desire for the title and the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a profitable commodity. In view of the mentality that the enemy's enemies can help, the Magic Council simply smuggles itself to the Shahran Empire and strictly controls it. Quantity. Of course, the ancient inherited magicians who lived in seclusion in the East also kept their magic research and promotion by refining similar potions and magical items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caliline looked at Lucien and quickly regained her gaze. It seems that she has not fully recovered from the shock: "Yes, Mr. Peter is The real knight, whether it is strength, or his character and bravery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young nobles all look to Lucien, their eyes are extremely complicated, there are doubts, there are Lost, hateful, depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds the vigilant sword and laughs: "I have been in the North Flame Fortress for many years, and have experienced many dangers of life and death. The blood power. It is difficult for the baby eagle to learn to fly without being pushed out of the nest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina coughed softly, interrupting the faintness of both sides Confrontation: "Every distinguished guest, because of the assassin, our winter hunting will have to end early, but the scheduled welcome to Mr. Peter's dance is still scheduled to be held in my manor, where there are strict guards and pastor protection. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin is genuine, Carlylena's manor to the Ural City is not a short distance, and the sky will be black, so I am worried about the unexpected Balsh on the road. Ke and others have promised to participate in the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't give Carlyle and Peter the bastard a chance to be alone!" They snarled in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Different from Aalto, unlike the Tria music style, the Shahran music is beautiful but bold and full of unique flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall with red carpet, the young nobles gathered together with wine glasses and talked with a cup of amber gold on the long table in the corner. Lejia's spirits, as well as butter, white bread, muffins, creamy fish, black caviar, kebabs, fried chicken, steak, red cabbage sweet and sour soup, oxtail soup and other delicious cream desserts . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina as the owner, took Lucien in the ballroom and walked around and introduced him to each guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has changed her black evening gown to fully reveal her graceful figure. There is no extra jewelry on the body, just wearing a string of soft pearl necklaces, set off a swan like a white long neck and a towering chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
