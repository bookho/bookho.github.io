			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a The same cold wind blew the voice: "I recognize what I have, I will still die here. I originally planned to kill." You, cut off all the clues, but you accepted the task to go to the vast ice sheet, it is difficult to determine your position, so it was dragged to the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for Yakov Answer, he laughed happily: "If you want to resent, you will resent your Yakov boss. If it is not that he is involved in this matter, you should have enjoyed your life well. Now, even if you don’t know anything, I I will not let you go, cry, tremble, despair, enjoy the life of the last period of time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the scream of laughter Outside the cell, it was quiet again. There was no more movement. Even if Yakoff and others insulted, mocked, and asked for help, they did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...··· I will definitely escape, one day I will unscrew all of your heads and throw away the bears!" At this time, the husband did not shy and stutter, and played the role of the "satire" of the warrior. Gradually, there was only one voice left in the entire cell. The mercenaries who had cooperated with him became quiet and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being looked at by a few different sights, Yakov stopped the "taunting" and looked around the mercenaries who could not rely on the cell and saw several indifferences. A slightly hateful eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s heart is cold, and the voice of the rough is low: “Do you hate me? Resentment I am involved in the affairs of Sir Dudah?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We didn't do anything, but we were arrested and will die at any time. Yakov master, do you say we will not be reconciled? Will it be? Quite anger? At least, you have to let us know what it is for!" Yakov’s deputy, Huck, asked bitterly, although he still called the Yakov boss, but there was no respect in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you say that you offended Sir Duda? Then I definitely won't choose to stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard, do it yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough! You are enough!" Anna screamed, her voice angered To trembling, "What did you say when the boss of Yakov became a knight? When he was willing to let us be his knight attendant and housekeeper, what did you say? Yakov always thought about implicating us. It’s purely Duda’s villain is too damn!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so angry that she can’t accept the usual mercenary team that will become like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really only like the most desperate and dangerous moments that Katrina’s sister said, can she really see a person’s character?” She subconsciously Recalling a very philosophical statement that Katrina usually said - this is the sentence that Lucien made when he used "the poor and the present" into the opera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s screams and accusations made the cell quiet, and then, Yakov’s dull voice sounded: “It’s okay to resent me, but at this time Is guilt a hope to give up the escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are big knights in..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Dr. Duda has not played, he must be more horrible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov’s voice is calm but firm: “Only I have tried to know if there is any chance of escape. Sir Duda’s previous words were obviously to provoke us and want to see our guilt and heart under despair. The ugly human nature in the depths, as far as I know, he likes to appreciate the despair and pain of others, so even if he dies, I will not let him be proud, you? Want to die in his ridicule?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks well!" The applause sounded outside the cell, and Sir Dudar said with a smile. Kefu, I remember that there is a very beautiful lady in your team. It is more beautiful than most of the noble ladies. Do you like her very much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want What to do?” Yakov held the iron railings with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann is angry and fearful: "It doesn't matter to Katrina's sister! She joined us halfway and didn't know anything!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!" Yakov swayed the iron cage, and a layer of bloodshot eyes appeared in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shook his head in horror: "You are a demon, you are a real demon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the legend, the devil likes to kill and destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the biggest compliment to me." Duda was not irritated at all, but was very proud of it. He laughed, "Oh, I I was in a good mood, so I decided to advance your death time to the present, so that you have no chance to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence, a commission The blood on the face of the soldier faded, and the morale that had just been inspired by Yakov was completely transformed into despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shahran Empire is sparsely populated, and the manor here is much larger than the Quentat, and it seems to be a dark, quiet manor. This is especially true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sir D'Auder's Manor is here." Above a evergreen tree, the nickname Kareldia of the black shirt and red coat looks like Standing at the tip of the branch, the black cloak behind it swayed as the branches swayed up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina floated beside him, saying nothing, mental movement, a black and white vertical eye appeared in front of the eye The pupils are all composed of black magical patterns, which are mysterious and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She follows the magician's code of conduct and tries not to engage in unprepared battles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret eye?" Viscount Kareldia looked sideways and threw a few illusory bats with the "Secret Eye" Sneak into the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, most of the scenes in the manor are displayed in their "eyes", Minggang whistle, trap ambush, number of enemies, distribution, probably strength And so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are several places surrounded by mysterious forces that must be close to detect the situation inside." Katrina has always had no nonsense in her fight, and she has been succinctly given to Karen. Viscount Erdia made a confession, and then her body gradually became transparent and disappeared into the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy who patrolled and guarded outside, couldn’t find us at all..." said Count Kareldia, lazy and casual, body Slowly blended into the darkness, "Beware of the savage of the barbarian werewolf.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders and the top-level knights and priests, in two high-end The strong is like a paper paste, but a few wandering adult werewolves are more alert to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the manor, like a group of puppets It’s so easy to walk! I came to the lobby of one of the main manor houses surrounded by mysterious power!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weak undulations flashed, Catri Na uses the "skills to eliminate the sound," and this super-magic technique once again casts the "secret eye" and lets it dig into the main house from the gap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One does not Knowing the material used to make the altar appeared in the eyes of Yakoff, Anna, etc., the ground is free to place long swords, daggers and other weapons. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This altar is all black and in all directions, carved with a face of a scorpion, their heads are double-angled, their faces are distorted, their teeth are protruding, and they are constantly dripping. Falling red blood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood falls on a complex rune at the bottom of the altar, and it rises with a faint bloody mist. The sweet scent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the middle of the altar, a statue of a human figure with a vague appearance, but with two pointed devil horns on the forehead. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s red eyes are very different in the darkness of the whole, as if it is a glance with it, deep in the heart will rise up a strong disgust All things are filled with the desire to kill and destroy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov, Anna and others walked to the open space in front of the altar and inhaled the sweetness. The smell of bloody and bloody, I saw this dark statue, and there was a faint indulge in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, who would believe your words? This chaos who admires the devil!" Anna snarled. But she also quietly stepped on a short sword. After all, she needed weapons when she escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Da patted the palm of his hand and came out of the corner with a sharp-edged werewolf and a calm knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "You can choose not to believe me, but then, your opponent is them, a total of twelve knights are strong. Oh, one of them is a big knight. Do you think that the hope of overcoming them is big or is it possible for me to promise to be effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov looks A young man with a huge sword in his hands, a heart slowly sinking down, this is the big knight who gave birth to himself, the same "blood giant" blood, completely and thoroughly crushing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you beat them away? Even he and Anna couldn't help but feel a little desperate. Other mercenaries were even more uncomfortable. Some people trembled and said: "Suddy Duda, Yakov is a knight, we all can't beat it!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huck!" Anna glared at the deputy leader of the mercenary team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov is slightly white, and one of his best brothers is going to kill himself in exchange for hope of living? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, Yakov’s blood power has been banned by me. He only has the strength of a high-ranking knight." Du Da smiled, a touch of blood More and more rich, so that many mercenary eyes have a bloodthirsty light, yeah, all of them are in this situation, and you can get rid of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yakov, it’s your fault. If you feel embarrassed, don’t resist, let us give us hope of living.” Hack breathed Rough, picked up a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sound of Dangdang, the other mercenaries also picked up their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Seeing their ugly performance, Anna shook her head in despair and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov looks at the mercenaries who are standing opposite each other and is in an unspeakable silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yakov, don't think about being a good person, if you don't live, then I will give Ms. Katrina to the werewolf friends, they like it most. Such a beautiful girl." Du Da fired on the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the Dutch sound in the throat of Yakov, it was difficult to provoke a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duda’s face showed a satisfactory smile, and the statue on the altar seemed to be clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I don't think that the group of wolves who have no brains know how to appreciate beautiful faces. For them, they are all female." Karendi Aziard leisurely refuted the words of Duda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina pressed her anger and blessed herself with a mechanized mind, her eyes cold and indifferent: "It seems that Duda is the host of the demon worship ceremony, as long as If you catch him, you will find clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there are no other strong people around, but two great knights." Karendia The Viscount sorted out his bow tie as if to go to a party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shed tears of pain and despair, clenched the short sword and tried to fight to death, her mind was slightly dizzy by the bloody smell, it seems to be a little under control I hate the emotions and want to kill all those ugly guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duda stepped back and stood in front of a door painted with a strange pattern, then raised his hand and sang: "killing and betrayal The feast begins!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of blood shines from him, and the power lost by Anna and other mercenaries returns quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna raised her dagger and hesitated and struggled to swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, can't kill each other! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill him, he is a hateful traitor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
