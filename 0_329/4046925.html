			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applied Magic Book? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this be publicly sold in a bookstore? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie seems to be able to hear his heartbeat, it is so intense, so crazy, in accordance with the rules of the Magic Council, in addition to going to the Magic Academy, Arcane In addition to local exchanges such as libraries, there are only two ways to gain application-level knowledge beyond their own level and level. One is to take risks or family inheritance, and the other is to become a private student of a magician, get his teaching, never There is no ordinary bookstore that can sell magic books publicly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the parliamentary control of the surname of magic to maintain a safe and orderly society, with the enthusiastic approval and active cooperation of the nobility. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, if I can resolve a one-ring spell in advance, or become a formal magician directly, then my prospects at Heidler College will be even brighter... ..." Downey felt that his heart was about to jump out of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not born in a magical family, nor has he ever had an adventure. He relies on his own hard work, analysis and practice to have the strength of today and is richer than other resources. The classmates are a lot worse, but he believes that with his solid foundation, it is not difficult to resolve the formal magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie’s eyes quietly looked at the counter at the door of the bookstore and found that the boss Dorothy was watching the TV show intently, so his heartbeat was faster. It seems to be heard by several nearby guests who are planning to buy books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With my memory, one minute can completely record a model..." Downey's fingertips slowly touched the spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover of this magic book is very special, giving an unusually cold and slightly paralyzed touch. Like a lightning that was frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of crispness made Donnie slightly stunned, and then his mouth was squirting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he opened his mouth and breathed, screaming as if he had to cut his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wait less than three months, I will be able to learn a magical and corresponding application knowledge at the Heidel School of Magic. Why bother now, sneak Looking back and forth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If caught, but will be put into the banned prison, the entire destruction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The benefits obtained are not directly proportional to the risk. Is there anything you can hesitate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie wants to think that he has just been stunned by the **. What is the "Death Scroll", in the current parliament may be just a classical work with research value! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, since the establishment of the parliament, the development of magic has been a thousand miles - the most obvious in the past 50 years, the vast majority of the ancient magic empire has long been turned into "Antique". The value has shrunk dramatically. Basically, no one will happen to get an ancient magic book. Then use this as a card to defeat one of the contemporary magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting rid of the impact of the **, Downey subconsciously wiped his forehead with his right hand. Suddenly I felt a cold, and he looked up and found that his right hand was holding a rag that wiped bookshelves and books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like chaos..." Downey shook his head in mockery, then took a look at Death Gull, revealing Obviously hesitant to put the application of magic books in the bookstore for public sales seems to be contrary to parliamentary rules and imperial laws. What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting the Disciplinary Department or the Police Department? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe not an applied magic book? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie hesitated for a long time, biting his teeth, holding a rag and going to the boss Dorothy, while walking, looking at the bookstore with his eyes The guests, once they are close to the row of bookshelves of the "Death Scrolls", immediately find an excuse to stop, if this thing is thrown out by others, they will be implicated, and it is also a crime to know if they are not reported. The guests turned a blind eye to the row of bookshelves, and no one had read the books in the past, which made Downey quietly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorothy looked back with a blank expression: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a copy of "Death Scrolls" on the shelves, are you forgotten on it? ?? Downey’s mind has already tried to understand the tone of this sentence several times, but it can be said to be as dry and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros’s expression suddenly became vivid, like a smile: “Yes, that’s my adventure. I forgot it when I changed the bookshelf last night. Above, Downey, thank you for your reminder, I will put it away immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie sees Dorothy to solve this piece along with the excuses he found. Things, without denying it, describe the "Death Scroll" as a historical work or an anecdote, and the heart is a long sigh of relief, so that the boss will not take into account that he knows too much and secretly destroys it - recently Many TV series adapted from the stage play have similar plots and have to be guarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros slowly got up and took out the "Death Scroll" in front of the bookshelf, put it on the counter, and smiled slyly: "Fast noon, to solve For your lunch, I will not provide you with free food and accommodation. Of course, your reminder is worth giving me a reward at the end of the month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It should be done, no, no!” Downey hurriedly waved his hand, but Dorothy didn’t say anything more. He could only go out of the bookstore and go to the alley near the Arc de Triomphe to find a cheap lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doros watched his back disappear into the crowd on the square, and his right hand gently stroked "Death Scroll" with a playful smile on his face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Death Scroll" suddenly spurred a faint glow of cold and evil under the touch of Dorothy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guest in the knowledge bookstore pressed his own soft hat and took a look at Dorothy and walked out of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the evening, Downey will leave from the "Knowledge Bookstore" Because he is going to the post office to send a letter to his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the development of the cable telephone and telegraph has been widely spread in the big cities, but Downey’s home is not rich, or only Can rely on cheap postal channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that family literacy is not much - basically he taught himself, Downey’s letter is very simple, just pre-reported the test, apply The magic school, the arrangement of these months, as well as the greetings at home. Therefore, when you hand over to the staff of the post office, you do not need to attach extra heavy stamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About a few days, when can I receive a reply?" Downey sent a few letters in the past few years, each time is different, so I can’t stand it. Live and ask a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff did not smile at the address of the envelope: "Normal is five days, as to when there is a reply, it is not that we can control it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s sarcasm, Downey still laughed, and it’s rare to meet such a humorous municipal staff. This bald uncle is much more interesting than his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until Downey leaves. The bald staff suddenly took Down's letter and walked behind. Soon after he walked away, a middle-aged man walked back from his stomach and muttered as he walked: "How can I eat a bad stomach? Oh, no. I have to go! Wait for someone to help me top!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storage room behind the post office. The bald man's right hand gently wiped the envelope. The tightly bonded openings are naturally separated, revealing the stationery inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...nothing special..." The bald man started the letter and said to himself. At the same time, what is quickly recorded on a small book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the recording, he re-stacked the letter, glued the opening without any flaws, and then took out a seal and covered it in the opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small town near Stroop Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" A girl with linen hair is busy preparing dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postman, your family's letter." The strange male surname came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl stunned and looked out the window. It was in the evening, there were people everywhere, so she put down her worry and opened the door: "My home The letter? Where did you send it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rentart." This postman is a man who is unremarkable and can’t remember his appearance. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lentage? Brother's letter!" The girl cheered up and took the letter and took it on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The postman did not stop her, but quietly looked at the room, a beetle climbed out of his trousers and climbed into the crack in the wooden floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mayor’s home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger is looking seriously at the opposite old man: "I need to check the town's information on the town."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir." The old mayor did not know what was going on, but he recognized the identification and the coat of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rentart City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several staff members are standing respectfully in front of a prominent figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need the entire Lentart bookstore information." The big man who is in a high position in the empire is said with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults." The staff answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Sky, Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Mr. Commissioner." The Arcanist in the Warlock's Museum of Warriors got up and walked the way, because the comers were wearing black flame coats on their chests. Member of the committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to my authority, I read Dorothy's information..." The member of the committee said plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Member."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dimly lit palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Downey's Letter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, from Pico Township Information..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, the record of the knowledge bookstore in the City Hall..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "His Royal Highness, Dorothy's information..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the information was placed on the mahogany desk, five long-haired white but not female fingers The information is gently tapped on it, elegant and calm and rhythmic, just like playing a piece of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of poor, talented, not cheerful, but the name is strong, can work hard, and the character is still correct, not by Dorothy's "Death Volume "temptation..." With the finger's knocking, a male voice with a low magnetic surname whispered to himself, and the voice had a peculiar gentleness, calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem with the family background, the father is the grocery store owner, the mother helps to maintain, the younger sister does not study... Relatives, neighbors, friends, and can't find problems for the time being... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dorothy, don't think I can't find out who you are behind, hey, you do other things, I don't bother, but if you exceed the limit Bewildered by greed..." Five fingers clenched into fists and gently licked the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
