			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Lu Xien smiled slightly, but he just made a joke and made a mood. I couldn’t think of Natasha’s soft and sad heart. Place, for a while, want to comfort but don't know what to say, it seems that all the words of comfort will spread salt on the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance of Lucien, Natasha licked her lips, whispered: "Reassured, I can be strong." No matter what the past, it is an indelible memory. To appreciate them and learn from them, this is the attitude of life that you should have. Also, in front of me, don’t worry about saying the wrong thing. We are good friends, and, am I so stingy and vulnerable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if so, then let me tell you the truth, we are from The only lesson learned in history and memories is that we can't learn anything from history and memories." Lucien is "a serious" authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Natasha, she first glimpsed, and then laughed when Lucian’s “Positive Face” couldn’t play and laughed. I couldn't hold the court etiquette with a smile, and I didn't laugh like a knight who always leaned back and smiled like a violet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheerful and complicated laughter gradually subsided, Natasha’s voice was slightly hoarse and said: “This is probably the truth, when I meet love again, maybe I Still, I will be fully committed to it, and I will be able to remember her wholeheartedly. I can’t remember any lesson.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A really good girl can have a really good relationship." Lucien is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s good-looking eyebrows pick: “As soon as possible? I’m the kind of casually forgetting the past, forgetting the feelings, then messing around and starting a relationship. People? I can be single-minded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she looks mad, but Lucien seems to be able to feel her true feelings, then It is with the laughter of her own and her, she will always hide in the depths of her heart and not dissipate with the sadness of others, so Lu Xien continues to be "surprised": "What? Your Royal Highness Princess A long love? Doesn't this mean that you have very little emotional experience? You have always said that you should teach me how to pursue a girl. I now doubt what you can teach me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how can I experience less emotional experience, and I have a person with a 'complete' emotional experience, yes, I am also a lady, and understand the psychology of girls! What is Lucine, Even the girls’ hands are not officially taken! Of course I have a lot to teach you!” Natasha is “Ending” "The above increase the tone, to show that they can be single-minded, although still rich experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deliberately said: "Don't mention this every time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, change a topic. Lucien, your first kiss should still be there, the girl's mouth is very sweet and sweet, and you haven't tried it. You are sad." Natasha smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't behave like a wolf..." Lucien blamed "angry." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topic unconsciously became a "gentleman". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smirked: "Lu Xien, you really are innocent 'little boys'. You have to admit, in pursuit of girls and true love. I really have a lot to teach you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I admit." Lucien "smiles" with his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haha, Natasha suddenly smiled smugly, beautiful and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smug laughter gradually stopped, Natasha looked up, smiled lightly and looked at Lucien, her eyes were clear and calm: "Thank you, Lucien "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what friends should do." Lucien put away the expressions of "helplessness", "sorrow", "anger", and the same gentle laugh. Answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After this laugh, I feel that I am peaceful and peaceful. No love is not the last, I have a father, an elder, and Camille." Auntie, and Lucien, your good friend, I will really get out of the shadows." Natasha kept a touch of calm and grateful smile, and then the surname did not change, "I will introduce you." A good girl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not open the joke of Sean again, and raised the question he always cares about: "After John ignited the blood, he has been shackled as a knight, with the title of Lord, and his loyalty to our Violet family, like his teacher, Sir Wien. So he has a territory of several estates near Aalto and a garden villa in the aristocratic area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Uncle Joel and Eliza In the past few years, I have been studying aristocratic etiquette, helping John to look after his family property and helping him to communicate with other nobles. Although he has studied hard, he was often looked down upon by other nobles, but for his son, they worked very hard. Persevere. 'The eight-finger harp poet' Joel began to be a bit famous in the aristocratic circle, but in the aristocratic communication occasion, probably only when playing music, your uncle Joel is the heartfelt happiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Ai Wen has grown taller, like a man, has been training hard Knights; Felice has just held the first in life The concert was not bad. It allowed her to really step into the circle of musicians. After three years of hard study and marriage to her family, Elena passed the Musician Examination some time ago and was hired by a large orchestra. It’s my own business, it’s no longer the kind of ordinary lady who is attached to men...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Piyal lost two years later, defeated himself and started Learn the piano fingerings you laid the foundation, and blend with the past harpsichord fingerings, with your own characteristics of retro-style playing skills; your student Grace has done a lot of work on the piano, praised by many musicians The creation of several piano pieces is also OK; Lott and Herodotus are excellent leaders because of Mr. Victor’s status in the music industry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, John is not in Aalto, because according to the rules of the Principality, the new knight must join the Violet Knights, stationed in the Dark Mountain Fortress or the Northern Fortress for five years, and then dispatched as appropriate. He is currently in the dark. Mountain Fortress, if Lucien you stay in Aalto for a while, he may have a holiday back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to Natasha Lucien’s heart is surprisingly soft. On the one hand, he hears the news of familiar people. On the other hand, Natasha is the princess of the Principality of Vaolirit, the future Grand Duke, the Countess of Violet, but only because of his own I always pay attention to the news of little people who have nothing to do with her, or even worthy of her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Natasha stopped and looked strangely at Lucien’s soft and quiet smile: “Lu Xien, why are you looking at it like this? I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grateful to Your Royal Highness, you will find out what I want to know, and those who want to pay attention to it." Lucien gently Smiled, the tone is sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s mouth rises: “That is, I am great!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borrowed With this topic in mind, the two talked about the things they had experienced together, the rumors of Aalto's rumors, until they saw the sky lit up, Natasha was still unsatisfied: "Day is..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got up and smiled and looked at Lucien: "Your Uncle Joel, Eliza is currently out of the city, so you first go to the Musicians Association to visit Mr. Christopher. Mr. Victor, let them be. Then hold a concert as soon as possible, and then you can 'fallen' with a brilliant attitude. Unfortunately, you don't have a new symphony, or else, if you can appear in the last music with "Fate" With the same level of work, your musician career will have no regrets and become a master remembered by history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, "Moonlight" and "Storm "It's all good, with the previous works, it is also a very good concert. I know that Lucien is busy at Alinhe to make up the basics of arcane and enhance the magical power. I also appreciate and understand your concentration. This is the quality that every successful person must have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed softly: "In fact, after two trips, I saw different music, I also have some ideas, but also wrote some music, but I don't know enough time. Finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien often uses music to relax, so it also combines the world's folk music, his own nostalgia for Aalto, etc. Ke "New World" has written many movements, but his own strength is far from the standards of the masters. The final symphony is very similar to "From New World". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, really? I can’t wait to hear it." Natasha’s expression was so excited that her face seemed to have a radiant glow, and she suggested : "I don't know if you have any thoughts on religious music. If you can write a symphony that praises the Lord on the surface, you will have unexpectedly good results when your identity is exposed. Forget it, it is my own stupidity, you But there is no faith in the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
