			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the lack of depth in the study of space and time, there is no established theoretical system, so Ramiro’s self-destruction interferes with the “gate of the aliens” in the Magic Council. All arcane masters are completely random in their eyes, and it is impossible to accurately infer the position of their space after transmission, and they are the secrets of fate, its speciality and the world's powerful interference with long-distance casting and prediction of distant things. They have caused the storm masters and elemental dominators who have close ties with themselves to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien preliminarily inferred that this surveillance grievance was integrated into his body and soul before entering the door of the alien world, in order to determine his position. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, behind the scenes, what can be found faster than the teacher Fernando, the prophet, etc., and the chance that he has not recovered is attached to the grievances? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a great arcane master who is also good at necromantic magic, if this grievance that can be "smothered" by pale justice has long been hidden on himself, The teacher Fernando can certainly see the clue when he meets face-to-face. As a result, there is a certain scope for the time when he is "wounded by the grievances", that is, from the teacher Fernando to the door of the outside world, to himself being Ramiro. The self-explosion forced the time to flash into the door of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The biggest possibility is that the black hand behind the scenes has done his hands and feet on Ramiro. When he blew himself, the grievances took the opportunity to attach to me, and blew himself. The power also wiped out all the traces, and I was forced into the door of the outside world. Even if you have doubts, you can't find any clues."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The ability to know exactly when the parliament opened the door to the outside world would allow Ramiro to assassinate the door without hesitation, and be good at this way, the soul of the dead, the demon lich or the cursed eye What do you want to know from me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaving memory and strong cues can achieve the degree of temporary control of Ramiro's actions without causing him to be alert, allowing him to think that he is making his own decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scene of memory flashed in the mind of Lucien, looking for something that he missed without thinking deeply.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Suddenly, Lucien’s flash of light flashed and he woke up: “When I entered the dwarf underground ruins, I encountered a high-level undead sneak attack in the dead spirit world. I suspected that it was the case that Mr. Rhein’s plan was noticed. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Ador was arrested and sent to Allinge by the soul of the dead, there was no such thing as Lord Maskillin and Mr. Rhein being trapped in death. The memory of the spiritual world. At that time, I thought that the order of Ador was not high, and I could not reach the deeper secrets. It was very contradictory to look at the previous thing. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From the deepest memory of the high-level undead, it can be seen that although it hates Ador, it can only curse him to be purified by the Church of Truth. Obviously he is an assistant or subordinate of Ador. If he even knows Mr. Rhein’s plan, how could Ador know not? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Adolf really doesn't know, why did the high-ranking undead attack me?" Revenge for his stupid owner Felipe? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two things just form a paradox. The best explanation is that Ador does know a lot of things, knowing that Lord Maskillen and Mr. Rhein are trapped. In the realm of the dead, knowing their relationship with me, so there will be actions against me, and Ador, who knows so many things, is sent to Ariel and becomes unknown. It must be deleted. His memory. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, the suspicion of the cursed eye is much smaller, regardless of whether the soul is the master, he is at least acquiesced and connived! Want to find them ahead of time by my sense of mystery with Silver Moon Aitna or the Necromancer? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's no wonder that Ramiro will go to the Eldo Peninsula to search. It's no wonder that he can find An Hughes in the first place. No wonder he has repeatedly tried to do it to me. How can there be so many coincidences! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a deep breath and kept himself calm, and the feeling of being stared by a legendary strongman was not good.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this other sorcerer is also suspected. For example, if the grievances are attached very early, Fernando does not "see", and the reasoning before the Sean appears. There was a great loophole, and Hathaway, who guarded Aringe at that time, also had enough time and ability to do it, but in comparison, the suspicions of the two of them were very small, and the surname expressed by Hathaway was dead. Spiritual magic is a relatively ordinary level and a new alchemy brought her a smooth path. With the teacher Fernando getting along with himself, with his last name that has never changed for hundreds of years, Lucien chooses to believe them. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, when I first dominated the domain by the underworld, Aitna had already watched me, but I didn't come out to meet with me. I was so sleepy on me, and I helped, killing the underworld would be easy. A lot, it seems that the reason why he didn't come out is probably because he noticed that someone is monitoring me. So, it is the sudden collapse of the meditation domain that caused the short-term failure of monitoring. Therefore, Etna can suppress this by the inherent gap. Wraith, this made me meet with me, otherwise he hid with 'beef jerky', how could I find him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, The chillyness behind Lucien is not the resentment that has not yet been eliminated, but the fear from the heart. I rushed to kill the grievances. Isn’t the legendary power behind it already aware? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the decision was made, Lucien jumped out of the window directly, only hope that the legendary strongman was worried that the silver moon and the dead spirit existed, hiding in the very Far away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gloomy grove behind, but for Lucien, who has a knight after the transformation, it is as short as the sides of the bed, and jumps into it a few times. In the river, lift the knight to transform, turn into a small fish, swim for a while, then climb the shore, cast a spell to erase the traces, then continue to jump down the river, swim to the dense place of the temple, if the legendary magician still Being able to lock in his whereabouts, then lead him to the eccentric "one-eyed" in the mouth of Aitna, this is a way to survive in the dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After swimming in the temple area, Lucien deliberately slowed down the speed, carefully sensing the surroundings, especially concerned with the changes in the left hand, if the legendary magician behind Being rid of, did not follow, then there is no need to provoke the war master Anantan, relying on the speciality of the fate of the secret and the ability of the silver moon self-shielding has a very great grasp to completely jump out of this conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s so quietly swimming for ten minutes. Suddenly, Lucien felt the river swaying as if there was an earthquake in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the water grass, the road to the west of the mountains outside the city, the thunder and lightning, the dead moon, the towering peaks violently collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are high-ranking powers in action?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, they are killing thunder and lightning God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the idea started, Lucien heard a roar, a long black arrow with no black brilliance shot from the Temple of War, in a flash It flies in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the distance is too far, Lucien can’t sense that the arrow of Anantas is not shot at the other side, only to see the gray death. The gas is a lot weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, there was a cloud of smoke in the Temple of War, with a strong conquest and a long horn rushing out of the city, He seemed ready In just a few seconds, it has already been entangled with that dead air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the temple of "Dawn and the Star of the Twilight", a splendid star rises again two or three seconds, following the Lord of War. "charge". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it just had to fly over the Sonar River, and there was a dark and horrible fog in the dark night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright stars flashed a bit, fell from the sky, and fell on the riverside, revealing the appearance of a mature surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axin is a little scared: "Francis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, the forest behind him There was a round of clear silver moon rising and colliding with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the danger of avoiding the main impact of Asin rolling, suddenly jumped into the air, his face was even more pale, the scimitar in his hand had already broken: "El?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his screaming, there are countless stars coming out of the fascinating El, twisting into a cage, trying to bring Him Stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condensed death scent escaped from the body of El, dispelling the starlight cage, and he calmly said: "Francis, you are entangled in him, I am deprived by law." His sacred name, my incarnation, the thunder and lightning angel, the angel of the earth, and the angel of wisdom can't stop Annatans for a long time. When I absorb his god's surname, I can contend with Anantans positively!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
