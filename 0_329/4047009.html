			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Douglas’s speech, all the magicians present were silent but steadily left in different directions, ready to complete the tasks they were assigned to, and they were not excited. There is no enthusiasm, no encouragement and incitement. Some are just choices from the heart after calm and rational thinking. Some are just resolute actions in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know what we want, and we know what we will pay for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked solemnly at the magician to leave in an orderly manner, watching the legendary magicians such as "The Lord of the Cold" and "The Eye of the Curse" pass the half-face After rushing back to his organization and rushing to the city they needed to arrive, after a long time, he sighed softly and said to Fernando and others: "We should act."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Fernando and others did not speak, followed Douglas to the depths of this crypt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the thriving Asahi rises, dispelling the darkness and bringing light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, above the plain near Rentat, the earth suddenly violently swayed, and there was a huge roar of the Qianlong in the depths, a beast Being alarmed, I ran away from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth collapsed into a black hole, and numerous cracks spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical volatility of the horror erupted from the deep pit, and a dazzling ray of light shone, and some vie with the sun in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a big movement, how the Cardinal Vatican, who is stationed in Rantat, may not be aware of it, and immediately opened the entire defensive array of Rantat. Then the giants of the Cardinal and the referee flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a saint, he cannot hide in the city of Rentatt with fear and fear. Nothing is explored, nothing is handled, let the magician madly plunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the truth god teaches the position of the rule, has this happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as long as he does not encounter the legendary peak, he believes that his strength is absolutely self-sufficient, even if there are more than three legendary magicians on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he flew toward the Rantat plain, he also commanded a cardinal who stayed behind and asked him to order the noble knight to follow and assist in combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a bishop and a pastor respectively directed the Knights of Truth. "ruling" the Knights. The residents of the "Sacred Cross" Knights rushed to rush and urged them to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The initiative of these nobles has been getting lower and lower over the years, and there has never been a beginning. The Cavaliers are immediately active. The momentum must be rectified!" A similar idea emerged in the hearts of the clergy, accompanied by their arrival outside the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Start immediately, encircle the plains!" A bishop severely ordered the knights of the Knights of Truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep Blue Gift" Sharp is not here. "The penalty for sterling silver" Seske stood up and said coldly: "The King's Majesty has orders, all knights do not get a place before he allows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you mean by this?" The bishop shouted angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The penalty for sterling silver" Sesker said with no expression: "This is what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You are going to abandon the Lord? You are colluding with the magician, corrupt and degenerate!" The bishop completely left the anger. "You will be tried by the religious court and sent to the firearm!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceske's right hand waved, and the bishop immediately plowed a deep black ditch by a silvery lightning bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the bishop’s eyes and said, “Speak more, die; go one step ahead and die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You!" The bishop was stunned, and did not expect a noble knight to dare to be so disrespectful to the Lord's servant, so full of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long sword was pulled out, and the cold light shone in the sunlight. All the knights in the camp looked at the bishop with unscrupulous eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of bastards, have been holding them for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church splits, seeing you dare not be so arrogant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop was so scared that he could not believe that this was the Holm kingdom bathed in the grace of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nexus Palace, the "Sword of Truth" Hofenberger squats on the throne, looking at the void in front of him, a illusory crack, If there is no place, the scene above the plain is presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the main hall, the aristocrats, counts, and other nobles gathered together to look at the closed door and wait quietly for the king’s command. At this moment, they fulfilled The Cavaliers vowed to entrust everything to their loyal lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if these years the church is pressing hard, killing and killing them, let them be scared day and night, at this time absolutely can not be so united. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep pit of the plain, the light is more and more dazzling, a horrible pressure is leaking out of it, and a huge city can be seen from below. rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Vatican arrived with a cardinal and referee giant when he arrived here, just to see that the mountain-sized city surpassed the light horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floating City? Is there a magician trying to float the city?" Vatican was slightly surprised to think that this was not a floating city that was repeatedly proven to fail during the Magic Empire. Planning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is called Alinhe, meaning "city of the sky" in the language of the hills." A thick voice, one The magician in the majestic black robe appeared in front of the floating city wrapped in light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas, the Speaker of the Magic Council." Vatican was stunned and recognized the identity of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few decades, Douglas has shot several times, saved many magicians, killed many clergymen and night watchmen, and is famous in the purification sequence list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at them, his eyes were sullen and dignified, and a strange starlike instrument appeared in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heaven of the Stars!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surroundings immediately become dark and innocent, a little bit of starry, van Gogh Lentin and others were trapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of Nexel Palace, except for Hoffenberg, there is no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he said casually: "Douglas really has amazing strength, and he wants to kill Vatican at the same level."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼." In the void ahead, a cold voice screamed, from Pope Gregory, familiar to Hoffenberg, to Pope Gregory, who is fighting the heresy in the northern front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the king of a great kingdom, he has a secret way to contact the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics who returned from the defeat of the various Knights were furious and scared. After the discussion, I decided to directly question King Hofenberg and see if he dared to admit that he had forsaken the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the light that shrouded the entire city converges and everything is restored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could this be!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergymen are facing each other, the horror fluctuations outside continue, why does the defensive squad suddenly disappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Nexel Palace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Hofenberg!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suddenly wake up and understand what it is, the defensive array has two control cores, one in the cathedral. One is in Necker Palace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loud bang broke out in the aristocratic area near the Nexus Palace, and the clergyman looked at him in horror, only to see a magic tower rising from the ground, in the spell effect under. Form quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to have been prepared for a long time. Otherwise, the magic array and so on cannot be completed so quickly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a magic tower in the nobility area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clergy felt the bitter cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark, pointed magic tower grows at a speed visible to the naked eye. Zachary, the priest of the Holy Spirit in the capital of the capital of the Principality of the Republic of Calais, can only hide in the cathedral where the defensive array is fully open. He is frightened and frightened and looks at this scene because he sees the "wind of the endless" Raymond. Standing with the "cursed eye" Atlante! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Salivar, the capital of the Kingdom of Buriana. In the capital of the Northern Alliance Coastal Corridor, the city's capital, Ksvik, in the capital of the Kingdom of Colette, a similar tower of magic towers rises to tell the world the return of the magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cardinal in these places (non-legendary, because the church is not here), some are killed, some are hiding in the cathedral, relying on With the defensive support of the sacred array, and seeking help from the church, the church that is in full swing with the northern church can only draw a few legends at a time, and cannot form an advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the referee of Kukes is already full of dead bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this corpse climbed up and followed behind Vicente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked in the referee surrounded by the undead army and saw the thrilling "mad dog" in the "referee" room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicente?" Before the small town was slaughtered, he knew that Vicente was not only alive, but also came back for revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente looked at the "mad dog" and looked at the half-aged man who was already full of vicissitudes. He said coldly: "You are honored to be resurrected Shirley." The first sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voice, "mad dog" raised his hands, grabbed his neck, and screamed in pain. But I can't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his body began to stiffen and he was included in a strange coffin by Vicente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One magician entered the Rentit and looked at the seat The towering magic tower, the heart is inexplicable, the magic tower and myself can finally appear brightly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plains, the vast expanse of the stars disappeared, a body fell, only Douglas floated in the air, and the floating city behind him began to soar ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really is a metamorphosis with legendary peaks," Hofenberg said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, Gregory’s voice rang again: “What do you need?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At that time, I had to rely on the power of the nobility, so he did not euphemistically and said it straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a need for church reflection, and the church needs to understand its boundaries." Hoffenberg's tone was plain and waveless, as if discussing the weather today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Introspection? Understand your own boundaries?" Gregory's voice brought a little anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Hofenberger did not retreat a little, his right hand gently stroked the "Sword of Truth" around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak of the floating city is flying higher and higher, the building above has The repairs were intact and the cracks were all gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
