			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s gloomy face suddenly dignified. In his heart, “Professor” is the most worthy enemy, and he is truly arrogant and confident. The opponent who lost confidence is an elemental master who is even more unpredictable than Larry. It is probably the first person in their generation of young genius to step into the field of high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is low-key and solemn: "Rogerio, the professor returned to Allinge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Rogerio smiled and did not answer directly. Instead, he said another thing: "In the "Magic" journal that was released the day after tomorrow, my paper on the soul of the electromagnetic interference in the Necromancer will be arranged. In the first article, I got unprecedented glory, but Mr. Alan Garde, the editor-in-chief of the magazine "Magic" the day before, made a special trip to 'Heidler' City to apologize to me, my paper can only be ranked second."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe is also a person who can hold his breath, without asking the "professor" news, as if the face of the sick is first of all doubts: "Which is your lord?" New arcane thesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Rogerio nodded with a slight regret, "The storm dominates yours."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this name, even the gloomy Felipe reveals a little fear, because this big arcane In addition to the achievements in the field of arcane and magic, you are also known for your temper and surnames. No one dares to explain the theory and process of the omission of omission in front of him, because he will ridicule and refute without mercy. What level is the opponent, it is like the momentum of the storm, even the legendary magicians in the top panel are unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the essay research paper of Lord Barista submitted recently? Otherwise, Mr. Alangard will not take Rogerio’s paper In the first article and tell you." Felipe is very concerned about the latest achievements in arcane and magic research, this is an era that will fall behind without learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio poured himself a glass of white water and held it in his hand: "I am also very curious, so I went to the basic arcane library of Aringe. This newly-reviewed paper is about the application of electromagnetic waves. It has a great reputation and shows the application of electromagnetic waves in various magic fields. You can see it after the day after tomorrow. It is a paper that should not be missed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, what I want to tell you is not to recommend this paper, but to mention in the paper that the storm dominates you, he is due to another paper. Inspiration. For a moment, out of curiosity and learning spirit, I found the unpublished paper in the library, a small experiment on high-frequency sound waves."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe didn't speak, listened carefully and focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This paper is Lucien Evans? X." Rogerio smiled. "If it's just this name, I won't have any." Suspicion, but he did not have a formal arcane level, which led me to some associations, so I went to check the time he joined the Magic Council, which was a week ago. That is to say, Felipe is more than three times after you return. In the month, he came to Allinge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe frowned slightly: "Rogerio, you want to say that the big musician Maybe it’s just a coincidence?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the original Wilfried collar, professors and great musicians appeared at the same time, let’s find the “pale” of this matter. The hand, like the Viscount Kareldia, connected the two together, thinking that Natasha asked the professor to protect Lu Xien, so he heard the name and recalled that the subject of the conversation was a professor. Felipe naturally I think of a big musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The broken ring, the seven-element alloy, the relationship with the great musician and Her Royal Natasha, can we boldly guess that the professor was exposed to Karen Viscount Diad sees Holm's crown ring '谟'.” Rogerio, like all the gentlemen who like to show off the esoteric, once again shifted the subject. “Let's go back and think about it. When was the professor first appeared? When a magic apprentice tested the great musician Mr. Evans. The silver-white horn kidnapping plan was destroyed by the professor. Who is the benefit? It is the great musician Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He called Natasha as His Highness, not because of her identity as the Countess of Violet, but because of her blood relationship with a certain lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe seriously thought: "Rogerio, do you think their relationship is closer than we have previously guessed?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe nodded lightly: "It makes sense, but it's a bit strange." He and Rogerio seem to know something hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is always a solution." Rogerio shook his head too carelessly and continued, "His Natasha Princess is said to be at the monastery." After three years of hard work, our great musicians took the time to go to Allinge to receive formal magic education to upgrade the level as soon as possible to deal with future changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lippe touched his chin with the left hand with fewer fingers: "But it is Mr. Rogerio's speculation that there is no evidence that Lucien Evans, who published the paper, is a big musician. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yeah, everything is just speculation, at least that paper and the strength of Lucien Evans? X, the ancient magician passed down. A little bit of conflict can only be said that he has a very good arcane talent.” Rogerio suddenly laughed. “But don’t forget, I met the great musician in Aalto, so I went to Douglas Magic School. I took a moment and confirmed my thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp; then he used the deterministic name to say: "He must be a 'professor' of the smug student! From him, we can uncover the true identity of the professor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Professor's smug student? Well, from this perspective, it seems to explain why Lucien Evans can write a paper cited by the Archaic Master, because he not only touched the arcane and magic foundation. It’s only been more than a month.” Felipe is not a fool, and naturally he thought of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio knocked the table with satisfaction: "There is one more point, the paper is about the application of high-frequency sound waves, and the professor's logo is surnamed magic. Felipe, what do you remember based on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe looked back seriously: "According to Viscount Kareldia and Amorecuk The description should be a low-frequency sound wave. Although it is not clear why there is such a large vibration effect, it is at least a low-frequency sound wave. Oh, one is the application of high-frequency sound waves, and the other is the application of low-frequency sound waves, saying that he I am not a professor of smug students, I don't believe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yesterday I specifically listened to Lucian's lesson in the corner, very interesting, and No matter whether the apprentices are listening or not, it is an innovative way of teaching, which is completely consistent with the change of his surname in music. It can be said that this is his family name and characteristics, perhaps because of this, he got the professor Value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;罗Rio recall yesterday's "magical creatures introduction" course, Lucien humorous, heuristic lectures made him feel very good, so that even apprentices crying again and again in practice, he is also satisfied, genius is the need of a solid foundation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of you said a word to me, basically determined that Lucien was a "professor" in Altuo's smug student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t get along with Lucien for a long time like Natasha, and they experienced a lot of things, and they were very aware of lies and details. And Natasha still doesn't know the "Professor"'s arcane level, and can directly use Lucien as a professor. In their view, the professor who can design artificial urea experiments is definitely not the one that has been exposed to magic for more than a year. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blind spot of their thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for opportunities to use charm to get Lucien to 'Heidler' to use magic to detect thinking?" Felipe asked Rogerio's direction of action . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio shook his head: "The professor is probably perfecting his experiment and wants to launch the results of the decision on the surname. If we rush to deal with Lucien, It is very likely that he is alert and difficult to achieve the goal. It is better to observe for a while, to see who Lucian is in contact with, and what experiments he is doing. Let me arrange this for you. Felipe concentrates on research, if you can If you decide to make a surname before the professor, then we don't need to consider the means of violence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe frowned: "In fact, I have a hard time understanding If the professor is in Aringe, why not publish the synthetic urea first, although it is easy to be overthrown by our concept of non-living matter, but the topic of such a controversial surname is not to bring him many arcane points? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe he wants to have a decision on the surname, and then slowly step by step, first causing controversy, getting a lot of arcane points, and finally throwing a conclusion Rogerio laughed, "In fact, Felipe." Why not directly publish the paper on synthetic urea? It is said that our pale hands and dead spirits are decaying and backward. If they are overthrown, it means that we constantly surpass ourselves and always walk in the truth of arcane. On the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
