			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Antec identified the problem of Fernando and joked. "Do you suspect that a legendary lord will surrender to the church? What good is this?" Ordinary Archmage can be safe, can get the materials provided by the church, what can a legendary magician get? When the external problem is lifted, he will definitely be the first hidden danger."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fluent and sharp explanation is not like the timid, awkward guy of Antec can organize it temporarily, most of the time he remembers when he listens to the "King of Nightmare" and Stanis... ... Fernando ridiculed Antek before, and he was just looking at his face: "What do you study in Courery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not belief The mystery, the shaping of the gods." Antec looked calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s bright eyes stared at him, and he was gradually unable to maintain a calm attitude, shrinking his shoulders and saying: “What are you suspecting?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but I am sure this is definitely not the answer, at least not the most fundamental answer." Fernando solemnly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec clearly breathed a sigh of relief and looked at Fernando sincerely: "At least this is also the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I understand, I won't ask again, letting a coward take over the pressure of himself will make him afraid to sleep." Fernando heard Antek's implication, and then asked, his own safety may be Unable to get a guarantee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec did not ridicule the anger, smiled and took the face of Fernando: "The more I fear, the more I can sleep."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of slippery fingers came, and he suddenly came back with an electric shock, and his face rose again. Fernando is still "Lando"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted and felt that his body had recovered, so he said, "I will leave here as soon as possible. The rot secret buried in the ground makes me sick. Skin There is a layer of embarrassment on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, this secret makes him feel dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I brought Betty and Leyva together before, just outside the city." Antec is very worried that Fernando’s identity will be seen by Fran. He will definitely be "involved", so when Fernando was in a coma, he advised him to leave soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at Antec with amazement: "It’s rare that you can prepare in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh." Antec enjoys Fernando's "praise." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando and Antec chilled a few words. After agreeing to meet in the future, I walked to the door and opened the door of the brass handle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, just outside the door came a man in his thirties, the five senses are ordinary, thrown into the sea will definitely be "flooded." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at Fernando, his voice low and said: "Although you are very abnormal, but with more than others' hunch and analysis ability, this is very good." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think you are 'praising' me, I will be very happy? Can't tell the difference between dream and reality." Fernando is as good as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man is Anthony's description of Fernando and the portrait of Stanis. The "King of Nightmare" in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Language can't bring you any benefit, but spells can." Staniss is cold and cold, "I listen to Antec and say that you have different illusions and dreams. I hope that it will not be too rudimentary, otherwise it will be a waste of my time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "I hope you don't waste my time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them and Antec were in the "ward" and exchanged their views on illusions and dreams in detail. Although it does not involve detailed magic symbols, spell construction, etc., it still has a whim and it benefits a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Has she returned to Holm?" Fran looked at Antec stunnedly, and his mind only had a picture of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t bid farewell to herself? Is it not worthwhile to say goodbye to the joy and happiness of this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this, think of Fernando who ignores his charm. Fran's heart is quite sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, next to Stanisel faintly said: "You are also interested in the male body of the female body? Antec is also good, his soul is more daring than the lady Small, transforming the body will meet your requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Fran first stunned, and all the doubts when he was with Fernando were all raging. Flip up. Looking at Antek in a fierce way - Fernando is not a professional play lady after all. For a short time, when I get along often, there are often details that make Fran feel confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antec was frustrated and went back a few steps: "This, it’s none of my business, it’s Fernando's own perversion, likes to become a lady."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still dared not lie in the face of Fran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran sullen, his teeth creaked, and he didn’t speak for a long time. When Antek was frightened and wanted to move to Stanis, she jerked. Waving his arm: "When I meet next time, I will make him a real woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten years, in the spring season, the grass outside the city of Rentart flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French is still wearing his favorite red magic robes. Fernando, the noble knights in the city of Rentent, and the clergymen walked through the streets in nowhere, and soon went to the roast Fish hotel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old Green, you are not dead yet!" he shouted as soon as he entered the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green looked at him with one eye: "You are dead, I am still not dead, today's letter."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw a thick stack of letters to Fernando. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although ten years ago the church returned the sword of truth, Hofenberg, and sent two saints to come over, initially stabilizing the situation, but over time As the church in the Aalto-Teria front line and the coalition forces are in a state of anxiety, repeated attacks, with the endless waves of legendary sea monsters frequently attacked, the number of church terror legends was apportioned and diluted, the Greater Holm area The aristocrats gradually got a different mind, not so hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation was restored to the peak of the "death lord" two years ago, and the cardinal of the later reinforcements was reached to the extreme, even if the road met wearing a magic robe The aristocrats, as long as they are not acting with the clergy, will close their eyes with one eye, and more and more of them will cooperate with the magician secretly, brewing, waiting, hope that one day will be here. The strength of the church is suppressed, forming a situation where the nobility and the magician are standing, and the church is the weakest but the strongest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando seems to have an invisible hand in front of him, grabbed the thick letter, and after disassembling, he unexpectedly saw that Hathaway became Juan Xiu has some handwritings, which are all about mathematics, and the complexity of these problems, Fernand’s talent in mathematics is dizzy, and there is a illusion that his own mathematical ability is no longer the same as Hathaway’s. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten years, perhaps no one can make a leaps and bounds in magic, but in the field of mathematics, as long as the talent is outstanding, ten years is enough to make a master of mathematics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This little girl's talent in the field of mathematics is not too bad." Fernando said with a symbolic tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green snorted: "This is your thirty-ninth time to make a similar feeling, directly admit that her mathematical talent is so harder than you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not hear this sentence because he had already done it and fell into the world of mathematics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is so profound about the number of streams, no, the calculus is so profound...has made a decisive contribution..." Fernando is more and more scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
