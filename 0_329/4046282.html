			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rhein. How are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked with doubts The sound came out really, and the high-hanging heart fell back to its original place. Although it was still alert, it was no longer the horror of the heart that was heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the acquaintance of the acquaintance “Observer” Rhein who did not have an audio contact with Lucien Alto, who appeared in the wine glass. Inside the projection of the dead cedar castle, and the relaxed and leisurely appearance, it seems to be waiting here for Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnificent gold throne that the Earl of Viter specially created to symbolize the glorious glory of his nearly one-hundred-year war is a tedious black and white ash in the realm of the dead, seems to be alive. Everything of value, such as feelings, glory, loyalty, treasure, food, etc., here, after death, will be the same dead, the same pale, without any meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Rhine on this throne is a complete display of silver, red and other colors, as if in a pool of stagnant water, in a rotten ruin In the body, he jumped into a living person, stirring all things in a colorful way, but he was so incompetent and full of strong sense of rejection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shakes the glass in his hand and looks at the scarlet liquid swaying and smirking: "I am here to wait for you, of course." Sean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Rhein, don't be kidding..." Lucien's mouth twitched slightly, and it was still familiar with the joke of love, which made him It’s a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucien didn’t believe that Rhein was here to wait for himself, because he had not been in contact with him for a long time, and he even encountered himself after he went to the Magic Council. What is the task of being assigned is not clear, and it is difficult to achieve such a precise degree by prophecy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shook his head, put down the glass, and slowly stood up, with two huge bat wings on the back, completely covering the dry vine castle hall, black light It swayed like a wave of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, the vampire... Is he a legendary strongman?" After seeing this scene, Lucien was finally sure. Even when he met the nickname of the "grandson" of the Rhine, Karen Erdian, Lucien probably guessed this, but the Rhine is so mysterious that only witnessing can be truly determined. Of course, sometimes, seeing is not necessarily true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine slowly walked down the throne and smiled leisurely: "Lu Xien, I am really waiting for you, and I have specifically projected it to this. In the dream of Count Wit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he performed very easily and easily, Lucien suddenly had a strange feeling that he used Do all the power to maintain the present existence, the front seems not to be real Rhine, but just a projection of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, Mr. Rhein? Do you know the world of the dead? Have you been exploring here?" Hearing the mention of Count Witt, Lucien looked serious Get up and ask seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein nodded: "I was originally entrusted by the Dark Council to go to Aalto to do something, but then I accidentally discovered the 'Silver Master' true seal. The existence of it. Because it is related to a sensation in the sacred history, it is related to the entry of the dead spirit and the secrets of the depths, so I temporarily changed my mind and cooperated with the original enemy."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Cardier?" Lucien thoughtfully guessed that he could cooperate with the mysterious figure of the legendary legendary strongman of Rheinland and was qualified before. He was regarded as an enemy, the whole Aalto, and only Cardinal Sald had this strength - the other two legendary powerhouses in the country are in the North Fortress, they are the head of the Knights of the Holy Sword, Natasha The teacher "Beauty of God" Beria, and the "chaotic serpent" Milton, who is closely related to the Violet family, "can be a priest of the Holy Spirit and the vampire 'the ancestor', it is really ridiculous..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland A beautiful smile, praised: "Yes, very smart. Later, we managed to achieve the goal. We only encountered some things when we explored the world of the dead, and Thrad was deeply hidden, so I was trapped in Somewhere in the depths of the Necromancer, it is similar to Muskilllin, which is reserved for your talisman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you..." Lucien asked in surprise, but soon he woke up. Before entering the spirit world, Rhein knew his whereabouts clearly, knew that he was a magician, and certainly heard the "big cross." The collapse of the Stars "locked down", combined with the secrets known to his "observer", is not difficult to guess that he has obtained the "Prophet" Maskillin's relics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when he is face to face now, his legendary powerhouse will be careful to find out the existence of the "曰之冕" talisman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he may have met Maskillin in the depths of the dead spirit...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dissipated and surprised, Lucien asked in confusion: "Mr. Rhein, you are trapped like Lord Maskillin. Why is the state different? What secrets are hidden in the depths of the dead spirit?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem that has plagued Lucien without knowing how much staying up late, especially after discovering that Maskillin is likely to be related to the emergence of the Truth. At this time, Lucien finally met a strong person trapped in the depths of the dead spirit, "presentation", of course, to ask a happy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland spread the stalls: "I have always been careful, I made some preparations in advance, and I can borrow some power, so even if I am trapped, I have not completely lost. Ability, there are ways to project it. Unfortunately, this projection can only be seen in the realm of the dead and there is no power. If you want to communicate with the main material world, you can only choose the kind of death that can be faintly sensed. The creature is then projected into his dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the things encountered by Earl of Witt are somewhat related to some 'guy' in the world of the dead, so I Always paying attention to the projections, and then knowing your arrival from the Miaka Dream, the Deformed Mage who was almost killed by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In view of the fact that you may have been from the horse Knowing the existence and mystery of the Necromancer in the leftover arrangement of Skilling, in view of your close relationship with me, you are a familiar friend, and given that you are the worst in all who know this secret, you will not start again. The idea, given that I can't project into your dreams, I decided to lead you to the realm of the dead, communicate with you, and then I got in touch with Count Wetter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original behind Things are so complicated..." Lucian whispered a sigh. "What does this matter about Mr. Rhein have to do with the realm of the dead? Is the secret of the dead world related to the gods? Do you want me to save you from trouble? I become Before the legendary magician, I am afraid there is no way to go deep into the spirit world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of problems exposed Lucien's shocking and complex inner feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein’s expression is rare, with a slight jaw: “I don’t know what the secrets of the dead in the eyes of others represent, but in my heart, from many intelligences and Judging by the secret, it is indeed related to the gods, and it is related to the real immortality. Unfortunately, I have not met Maskillin, and I have not been able to go there. I can’t answer what it is. Maybe you will explore it yourself in the future. The answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for this matter, someone who knows the existence of the dead spirit, even close to the secret of the gods with Maskillin sent a plot The property of the seriously ill Count of Witt is why he did this, and I don't know. According to normal logic, this is meaningless to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" And I ask you to help things in two stages. One is to wait for you to become a high-level magician, go to several dangerous places to start my pre-remaining arrangement, and find a certain existence, if all goes well, no second I can get out of trouble at the stage, if not Gong, then wait until you become a legendary magician, preferably an Arcanist, and come in to help me out, just like the request that Maskillin might leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was a little surprised by Rhein’s request, he left such a full arrangement, and then seriously said: “Mr. Rhein, you have helped me many times, I have always remembered if I can become a high-level magic Master, will try to complete your request as a legendary magician, now I can hardly say that I have the ability to promote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really is the name I know and like In short, I can only ask for such dangerous things, and will not let you make a vow, leave a promise, and look at your own willingness or not." Rhein does not laugh as easily as being trapped, "and I won't let you take risks for pure love. After you become a high-level magician, you have enough ability to go to my treasure place and take away the three items you like in the first few layers. If I can get out of trouble or you become a legendary magician, . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp open the treasure room the bottom, I pick up a collection of "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
