			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lucien took over the "Elements" of this issue, glanced at the title section and found that the author is a strange Tel Aviv, a four Level Arcanist, Five Rings Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe a new magician, and only such a young person can present this model without any tie..." Lucien Think secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that Douglas, Brooke, Fernando, Hathaway, etc. will not consider the possibility of negative energy states and antiparticles and if they do belong to this The world, then, in what form should they coexist with the original material, but even if they have this conjecture, they will not rashly propose it, but they will think carefully and wait for the confirmation of anti-particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they come up with a similar guess model, there is only one reason why this guess model helps to find and confirm antiparticle and negative energy states, and obviously "negative Energy vacuum sea""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this paper, the strange arcane master of Tel Aviv proposes a ubiquity from the basic microscopic particle nature. The "negative energy sea" filled with any place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the principle proposed by Fernando, electrons are always filled with the lowest "orbit" of the energy level, and the negative energy state is obviously lower than all the energy states currently found. The electrons will obviously move in this direction. Not to mention that the energy generated by this large-scale transition will destroy the entire universe. All the experimental phenomena observed so far strongly refuted this point, so the first negative energy state is derived. Dieppe, Larry and other talents will use it as proof that they are not thoughtful enough to make mistakes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien proposes his own quantum equation, prophecy After the existence of the particles, many arcane masters held a state of mind that was assumed to be true. When thinking about the negative energy state, the electrons did not "change" in this direction, so Tel Aviv had a bold guess, the reason why the electrons It is not based on the "instinct" to the "negative energy state" because the negative energy state has been filled by other electrons, and they have no way to go any further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he derived from the form of this electronic arrangement that electrons of negative energy state could not be observed by the arcaneists, at least not at present, so In his model, anywhere in the world is full of electrons of negative energy state, as dense as we live in a "negative energy sea", even if it is vacuum, there is no absolute vacuum, so this is A "negative energy sea" that "submerges" the universe has the energy of "infinite". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the negative energy state electrons can also be excited. When it absorbs the energy transition into a normal electron that can be observed, the "negative energy state sea" is left behind. A hole, this hole has the opposite charge and the same quality as the electron, that is, positron, anti-electron, and positron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this part, Tel Aviv has a sorcerer’s temperament and continues to make bold guesses beyond the content of the “Dilaike’s Sea” on Earth. He believes that this is everywhere. The "negative energy sea" is one of the reasons why magic and extraordinary power will exist. The essence of spiritual power, will, and magical pattern is to communicate this "energy sea" in a special way, thus gaining beyond imagination. The power to change everything has the source of energy for all kinds of magic and extraordinary power, and this also provides some ideas for explaining the conservation of energy in magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a long time ago, the "ice witch" Helen quantitatively verified the conservation of energy in spirit and magic: the amount of mental energy consumed is equal to the original contained in the magic. The reason why some of the magical effects of energy are far greater than the reduction of mental power is because they interact with the surrounding world in the actual reaction, causing a chain change. The most typical one is "eternal blaze", but the problem is that Where does the mental power after consumption get supplemented? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use magic potions to help restore mental strength to the normal category, no one questions the source of energy, but the natural growth of mental power is quite strange, whether it is Slow recovery or rapid recovery under meditation, it is difficult to give a convincing source of energy can not restore mental strength out of thin air? If there is growth, there should be a reduction in nature, but no such phenomenon has been observed so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, the Magic Council has two mainstream explanations for this problem. One thinks that the recovery of spiritual power comes from the reaction of the soul itself, using the most popular In terms of the soul, the soul is equivalent to a magnetically constrained controllable fusion reactor, providing reliable energy for itself, but the problem that this interpretation needs to face is the same. Even if it is a fusion reactor, it needs raw materials, and the soul relies on what is consumed to generate energy. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this model has its own flaws, and even Oliver can't fully agree with it. According to his theory, if there is little magic or even magic, the upper limit of life will be greatly improved, but in actual observation, less use of magic and frequent There are no essential life gaps between the two types of arcane masters who use magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other mainstream explanation for mental recovery is that energy comes from the "real world," and "meditation" is the way to connect the soul with the "real world." This can be confirmed from the fact that the magician can get the "real world" feedback and other professions can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "real world" where the energy is transmitted, that is another problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no way to explain that knights, magical creatures, etc. can also recover their own consumption, unless they are also "connected" to the "real world" for some reason Unable to get feedback on the "real world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the question of what the soul and the "real world" are has not progressed, these two mainstream explanations are only at the stage of conjecture, without theoretical and formula support. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflections Tel Aviv’s “negative energy state vacuum sea” model, starting from the Lucian equation, using the antiparticles that can be found as the basis for derivation, describing a The energy sea that is absent explains the problem of mental recovery in the simplest and most obvious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meditation" is the soul communication "negative energy sea", because it is ubiquitous, energy is almost infinite, the soul can naturally take its energy to restore mental strength, The "real world" feedback is because the theory is more awkward and the reality of the world, resulting in a corresponding change in the cognitive world, and the communication with the "negative energy sea" is instantly strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, this "negative energy sea" model also explains the small amount of energy required for the deformation of the magic, but the initial energy required for the excitation is rare, Especially after Lucien proposed the mass-energy formula, the study of this part of the deformation magic directly led to some people questioning the law of conservation of energy, but Helen designed a wonderful experiment to prove that the energy conservation in the universal sense does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of this model is so great that after Tel Aviv completed the main body of the paper, the emotions unfortunately thanked the Magic Council, thank you, "Atomic Control", I thanked the Lucien equation, thanked the anti-particle conjecture, and kindly called the “negative energy sea” model as “the source of magic” and “the sea of ​​extraordinary”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a significant paper that marks the beginning of a new direction for the study of the essence of magic by the Arcanists." Lucian probably finished the paper and evaluated it with a willingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the magic crystal light, Heidi’s eyes sparkled like a small crystal: “Teacher, do you recognize this model?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Acknowledgment? What is the recognition of a paper without evidence of experiments and phenomena? But his ideas are novel, and we have another way to explain the essence of magic, but it is not a path. The wrong way remains to be studied. Everything speaks with mathematics and experimentation.” Lucien smiled and said that without knowing that the model on the earth had been abandoned, there was no rash rebuttal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, Lucien himself is also exploring in the fog, the deeper the research in the microscopic field, the more he feels that the fundamental causes of the two worlds are different. Here, which part is specific, it needs to be explored in the future, so it cannot be blindly believed that it is wrong on the earth, and it must be refuted by experiments and deductions that it has done personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, Lucien also hopes that this model will inspire the Arcanists to think more about the nature of magic - a long period of time Time, the study of the essence of magic has always been in a state of stagnation and difficulty, so that most arcane masters are not interested in this aspect, do not consider why there is magic, but study the essence of the world and create new magic. And to improve the existing magic, I hope that afterwards, I will be able to "give the same path". After Lucien proposed the observer effect in the microscopic field, this idea seems to be proved to be correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher said it was right. At present, this is only a possible model, but with it, the problem of the essence of magic does not seem to require quantum pure state, superposition state. And the observer effect." Lei Yi Li Ya fell into thinking, a bit dull and said, attracted Heidi to smile, this is the face of the teacher's "observer effect" conjecture is wrong? Well, Annick and Sprint will be very happy, and their fancy on this paper is on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
