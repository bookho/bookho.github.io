			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tate, in a dark street. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sneaky little men carrying a heavy thing moving quickly, suddenly, a few figures were thrown out from the corner, one caught Pour them to the ground with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The heavy thing made a crisp sound when it fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black-skinned dog on Grande Street!" One of the little men blurted out in amazement and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, his face was slap in the face, a man in a black uniform and out of the darkness, bent over in front of him : "Please call us Mr. Police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Holm Kingdom Police Department is headquartered in the Granite Street of the administrative district, gang members, small gang criminals and Some citizens use the Grand Ling Street as a popular name for the police department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slap in the wake of the little man, he feared: "Yes, Mr. Police."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I heard that the black-skinned dog on Grande Street has a unique apprentice-level alchemy item. It is like an electric shock when it is hit on the body. It will produce long-lasting generalized paralysis and pain. It is better to die than death. Never be reluctant when you are a black-skinned dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The crime of stealing the manhole cover was captured on the spot. The evidence is conclusive and will be sent to the municipal court for trial. Well, 'crimes that endanger public safety in a dangerous way, If you don't have an accident, you will have a good second half of your life in the mine. Of course, if you are willing to become a magician's experimental item, you may be able to return to Rentatt in a year." The detective patted the face of a small thief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little thief was shocked: "I, the crime of endangering public safety in a dangerous way..." Mr. Police, what is this crime, me, we Just stealing the manhole to sell the money!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This long list of names is terrifying at first sight, obviously a serious crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I’ve already told you these bastards, pay attention to listening to the sound of the Holm Kingdom, waiting for the radio, and paying attention to the latest regulations. The crime of endangering public safety is the crime of adding the "Code" to the kingdom last month. The specific meaning is that... In this era, thieves who do not know how to listen to the radio will be eliminated sooner or later!" The senior police station stood straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crime that Natasha specifically proposed when the House of Lords discussed the Aircraft Management Regulations and the Road Safety Regulations, lest anyone intentionally use an aircraft disaster or a car accident. The way to achieve the purpose of murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, we just steal the manhole cover..." The two little thieves are crying, how terrible it is to go to the mine for the rest of the year. The scene, as for the way to become a magician experimental items to reduce crimes, they did not think about it, it may be more terrible than death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior police detective snorted: "You steal the manhole cover and let a large number of people fall into it and suffer from trauma. Isn't it a crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means?" After the mine, please repent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No policeman spared us, we don't dare to do this kind of thing if we know this crime." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Police, I, I have significant information!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two small thieves rush to the ground . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior police detective satisfactorily nodded and told the surrounding police: "Take them back, interrogate and record the good confession first."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two little thieves crying and being escorted away, a policeman next to him said: "Hey, you are so scared to scare them." "Significant intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told them not to listen to the radio, to be honest, I really want to add this crime to them XX, today In the morning, let me fall in the crowd!" The senior police detective was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that the head limping today, it’s almost falling into the sewer.······<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining policemen joined forces to lift the manhole cover back to the original place. At this time, one of them suddenly wondered: "Will we fall down when we round up the thief?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible, it is late at night! And we only haven’t stared at it for a few minutes." The policeman who was charming to the senior police detective did not worry about it, and then took it out. A specially prepared apprentice-level alchemy pharmacy fell in the gap of the manhole cover, and the manhole cover would be firmly stuck in the cold tonight until it melted away during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how they temporarily deal with similar incidents, specifically looking for ways created by magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, the police who rushed back to the warm Granite Street quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the manhole cover suddenly sounded "咚", "咚", "咚", and with the help of special alchemy pharmacy, the well cover did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark sewer, Nasdall instinctively rushed to the bottom of his mind, what happened to Renthal, and dug a good one in the middle of the street pit? It’s blood that falls into the body that is not too controlled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angry, grievances, erroneous emotions surged in his heart, making him want to leave the changing werewolf, and fly the manhole cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Calm, calm, can not reveal the identity of the werewolf, so as not to complete the task of the Prince." Nasdell said to himself over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he took control of his anger and then took a deep breath with satisfaction, and he was almost vomited by the foul smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a cool and wise wolf who is valued by the Prince, and must not be like other reckless guys!" It said to himself again, and then relied on the powerful self of the werewolf. The more capable, the other direction of the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the roar broke out again in the sewer: "Bastard, it is also stuck here<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what do the people of Rentat think?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long distance to go, and when Nasdell couldn’t control himself, the upper manhole cover showed no signs of sticking.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed open the manhole cover, climbed out, and took a deep breath of fresh cold, only to feel that this was the most delicious thing in his life! !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an adult werewolf, after experiencing this series of things, is inevitably exhausted, so he went to a nearby abandoned house Outside, sitting back against the wall, breathing back while recovering from the body's wounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injury he broke into the sewer has been cured and can be shocked The pain in the bone marrow makes him physically slow and can only wait for the slow elimination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The changes in Rentat have a good side and a very dangerous side. The lightning magic array that is placed everywhere without security protection digs the pit in the middle of the avenue·························· I admit that I don’t have the common sense of “safe use of electricity” and think that the actions of the magicians are too risky and rushing forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep and quiet, Nasdell thinks His mood gradually calmed down, and the injury was quickly restored: "But these encounters are just episodes, I have got rid of the danger, and everything will be better." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts in my heart just emerged from the instinct of racial talents that made him aware of the great danger, and thought about it without thinking.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his body has not fully recovered the sequelae of the electric shock still affecting him, the action is a little slower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;轰!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abandoned house behind him was violently exploded and completely collapsed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Lantat's people are crazy? My house has also been blown up without warning. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock wave hits Nasdell, and the walls, stone bricks, dust and other things will be drowned in the vicinity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the street is a group of people watching the explosion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supervisor, the new alchemy explosives provided by the magicians are very effective." Looking at the house collapsed, a brown-haired ordinary person excitedly The former middle-aged man said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is very easy to get rid of our demolition time, I believe we will soon be able to widen the streets here and build a new and comfortable civilian District." The director in charge of the demolition work satisfactorily nodded. The boss went to Aringe to buy a new alchemy explosive and invited a magician who specializes in explosives to point out the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary person next to the supervisor was in a good mood, so he asked the curiosity in his heart: "Supervisor, why do we have to dismantle in the middle of the night, not afraid to bother nearby Does the public sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then block the passage of the road during the day? This is the street that leads directly to the city gate. I don't know how much goods enter the market area from here! Those rich people are important, or ordinary citizens are important? Hurry up and let the lazy guys move, clear the streets before dawn!" Supervisor loudly told. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of workers started working. The ordinary person looked around with a little worry: "Supervisor, I didn’t check if there was anyone inside when I exploded. ······”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How could anyone? Blocked on all sides and also used the magic crystal lamp to make a warning sign, who will not come in with long eyes? And all the intersections are watched by our people, unless he can fly, or will dig into the ground!" The supervisor said with no anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Ali left the rented house and walked through a bustling street to the nobility area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demolition explosion last night was really horrible..." He sighed as he walked. The demolition work was pre-posted and various notices were made, so literacy He is very clear about what happened to the explosion last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a monastery near the entrance to the noble area, but it has been transformed into a school, and the sound of reading is heard from time to time, and a beautiful and magnificent carriage constantly From the aristocratic area, I drove straight into the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The second grade of general education in the Minnese Mills School of the Quinta Aristocratic District, Jane..." Ali looked at this far away The school is silent about the communication method of pen pals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second year of the establishment of the General School, the nobility decided to follow it to establish a special aristocratic school, not to let their bloody children mix with ordinary people. Reading – whether you like it or not, they have to admit that this way of learning together is more stimulating than the previous family education alone, and that this environment helps to build relationships, from adulthood to adulthood. There is a pretty valuable social circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali looked at a noble carriage and alchemy car into the school and watched the sky fly a different type of aircraft (there are models, there are The ship type, which has a reduced size of the airship, is deeply felt, and it deeply feels a gap and an invisible wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and turned away like many days before, his heart was full of emotions, he was inferior, he was dissatisfied, he was depressed, he was acupunctured. And the strong desires that come from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, he walked to the neighborhood of the demolition block last night and suddenly heard a whimper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Ali looked at the sound and found a big dog lying in the grass. The silver-gray fur was full of blood and covered with dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dog is like a wolf." Ali sighed, and he knew from the books that there was a dog that resembled a wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With good intentions, Ali walked over and found a lot of scars on the dog, and smiled: "Fortunately, you met me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
