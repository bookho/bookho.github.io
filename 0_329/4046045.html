			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Seeking Sanjiang Tickets, everyone can get one every day~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... .......................................................................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road From the grammar of the owl's speech, Sean judges that it is not a magician's deformation, but a magical pet. After each magic apprentice begins to learn magic, as long as there is a casting material, he can summon and make a magic contract. Pets, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different spellcasting materials, the summoned magic pets are different, there are ordinary creatures such as owls, cats, crows, and magical creatures such as the fairy "Dragon". After the magic contract is established, each of the magic pets and the master will establish a close, mysterious connection, allowing the master to gain some of his own abilities, and he can also borrow some of his master's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, summoned a cat to be a magic pet, the magic apprentice's agility will be upgraded to the level of the high-ranking knight attendant, and will also gain night vision ability, cat You can borrow the magic of apprenticeship magic like "forbidden light", "save organ", and the magic of the Necromancer, and then you can get the ability to speak and think simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the amount and number of magic that the magic pet can borrow depends on the number of magics that the master's mental power can continuously exert, when the mental power is insufficient to continuously release two When magic, the magic pet can not be borrowed, and the ability of the master to obtain from the magic pet will not increase with the increase of the magic pet level. If the magic pet is dead, or the magic contract is lifted, the acquired ability will also disappear. There will even be a certain degree of recoverable decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien has not made up his mind to summon the devil, although in the long run, it is equivalent to having more avatars, and in the short term, it can be improved. Your own strength, but your own situation is special, the establishment of this mysterious connection is likely to expose your biggest secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the strange owl Doro, Lucian pretended to be very scared and replied: "No, there really is no magician who has been looking for a witch, at least, I haven't seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl patted the wings: "Very good, you didn't lie. According to Doro's observation, there are no other magicians. I have been looking for a witch. Below, the second question, what did you see when you and the church guard went down to find the witch's magic laboratory? What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "An owl knows how to use the problem he knows to swindle people..." Lucien snorted in his heart, and then changed the things he encountered at the time, except for his soul breakthrough boundary, which was changed to 趁 Gary. Be careful to stimulate the truth of the Holy Emblem, the original local speaking, as for the soul library in the magic book and notes destroyed, while recording them, I do not mention, no one can think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a tragedy!" Owl Doro sighed fiercely, then threw his wings. "Very good, your answer is Doro. Very satisfied, good night, young man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it quickly flew out from the open wooden window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the owl left, the fear on the face of Lucian, the panic disappeared immediately, the candle was blown out, and then quickly replaced and he was successfully sewed. Soon the black linen robes with hoods, quietly open the door, go out, close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark, Ade has let the slums have no lights, and Lucien spreads his mental power and soon senses more owls. Luo’s own faint, spiritually impressed mark that others can’t find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a recent change in mental frequency imprint, combined with previous frequency, volatility, and radar knowledge. The official magician certainly has no effect, but the magic apprentice, the magic pet, as long as it is slightly careless, it is difficult to find that he has been left with a spiritual imprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, this owl is not flying too fast, still in my mental power sense, from its level, its owner should still Magic apprentice." Lucien sighed with a slight sigh of relief, running fast in the darkness. Once it was more than five hundred meters, Lucien's mental power could not sense the spiritual power of the special frequency fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the owner of the owl is only a magic apprentice, but in the past, Lucien is still dangerous, after all, what is the situation there, there is no other Magic apprentices, even magicians, are not clear about themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl Doro did not know that he had been left with a spiritual imprint by Lucien, and did not use all his strength to fly, and conversely, in order not to be noticed by the church-controlled Aalto, he fled very carefully and was very secretive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, its speed is better than the speed at which Lucien is not running at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes of tracking, Lucien had been opened by the owl Dorolla nearly four hundred meters away, which is still occasionally stopped to hide. Or pretend to be a normal owl flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the owl Doro’s wings were closed and slipped into a window without any movement in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ran to the vicinity, slowed down, quietly wrapped around the building, and was very surprised to see the building Signboard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Copper Crown Tavern"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a magic apprentice among the mercenaries and adventurers?" Lucian thought in confusion, noting that the window was a brass crown pub The far left room on the second floor is a very convenient location to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing the ice and snow avenger on the index finger of the left hand, Lucien wandered around the back door of the bronze crown pub, whispering the singular monosyllabic words, no spellcasting The material left a faint shadow on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Quiet Portal”, the illusion of apprentice-level magic, can cover the sound of opening and closing the door for up to an hour, but within this hour, Dismissed with the will of Xi'an. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien waited for a few seconds and continued to use the "switching technique" of not applying the material. A transparent, invisible light was shot from the hand and hit. On the door, the sturdy wooden door opened a gap without any sound, letting Lucien sneak into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-closing the back door, Lucien directly lifted the "quiet silence", so as not to be found by the fluctuations of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a pub, this time, the copper crown is also a lot quieter, especially near the back door, especially so that Lucien can quietly dodge occasionally People, go to the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly parked in the room not far away, Lucien passed the weak spiritual imprint and barely listened to the voice in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Lucien smiled and pulled the hood lower and walked over to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cool room, Smyr leans on one On the reclining chair before and after, listen carefully to the report of his magic pet owl Doro, holding a cup of amber wine in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dora liqueur", with low alcohol content, has a significant effect on sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owl's grammatical narrative, Smyr is already used to it, and it doesn't take long for things to be completely clarified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes, pondered for a while, and asked about the reaction of Lucien at the time. After listening to the description of Owl Doro, he licked himself. The forehead: "It seems that he does have nothing to do with the witch, but in this way, the gentleman who claims to be from the headquarters of the mainland magic parliament can't be found. Hey, do you still have to hide?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he sighed, suddenly, the door was flooded with a bang and a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small stood up violently, his expression dignified, and his voice tried to ease: "Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the owl Doro flew to the bed, hid in the blanket, whispered: "Who will be, who will be, is it to barbecue Doro adults?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quirky, low, hoarse voice outside the door: "I am looking for Mr. Smyr and Owl Doro."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What?!" Owl Doro yelled in the blanket and almost flew with a blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
