			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien moved his mouth, psychological activities, changes in people's minds, is it necessary to go to dream analysis, behavioral psychology, "Zhou Gong Jie Meng" and other aspects? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of wizards who think that Isabella can win the laurels? Is it because of its creation of surnames and breakthrough surnames that can further incorporate illusion into the arcane system? It’s a superficial, immature research that completely violates the spirit of magic!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison doesn’t pay attention to Lucien’s smile at all. Weird, continue to complain in angrily to Lucien, after quarreling with many arcane masters in the afternoon, he has accumulated a lot of emotions, and finally met Lu Xien, who knows the arcane, and It is a simple element and a star magician. Without a pre-set position, it can serve as a good audience, and naturally vents its views on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien with a glass of wine, smiling and listening to Harrison’s complaints, thinking of the paper he was about to write and submit, there was a subtle "shot" "feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Harrison stopped, and the dinner was about to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded gratifiedly to Lucien: "Evans is really an excellent arcane master, has a keen understanding of magic, can clearly judge Isa The value of Bella's research, if you have questions about alchemy or illusion in the future, you can ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for Wayne to answer, he and James, Russell Haisong and others returned to the hall together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say anything..." Lucien looked at the back of his turn and went out, shouting in his heart, just now he was just taking Listening to the smile, from time to time, grace and ah, how can I be accepted as a supporter of my opinion by Harrison? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he seems to like the nickname of the ancient wizarding empire, not the current arcane..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Lu Xien has contacted a high-level illusionist, and his subconscious mind judges his concept from his language habits and speaking tendencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Evans, let's go out, I will introduce you to everyone, they are all nobles in the kingdom that favor the magician." Prince Patrick ends After a conversation with the Duke of Russell, the Duke of James and others, he took a rest for a few minutes and took a tube of medicine to recover. Until now, he greeted Lucien and returned to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian stopped the analysis of Viscount Harrison and smiled and followed Prince Patrick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When twenty or thirty aristocrats and their wives bowed to the prince, Patrick pointed to Lucien: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is our party." The protagonist Lucien Evans, tonight's banquet is to celebrate his becoming a disciple of the storm to dominate your lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No advance notice, until this time The aristocrats who knew this thing were first stunned and then enthusiastically applauded. The reputation of the storm dominated these countries in the mainland is unusually loud. Many aristocrats know that he is a great arcian, and he is the core figure of the veto in the highest scrutiny of the Magic Council. His students are naturally heavy, and the road is naturally heavy. Sean? Evans’ invitation to Prince Patrick’s invitation to participate in such a banquet shows that he is a pro-family, and it is worthy of applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the applause, the Duke of the Bald, James came over with a glass of wine: "Evans, when you discussed electromagnetic communication, you didn't express any opinions, is it? In my heart, I laughed at the wrong direction. Oh, I don’t know if I can help you to mention the storm master, to see if he can reduce the electromagnetic communication simplification to the second ring. There is absolutely no problem in cooperation.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a slight "complain" in the tone, James uses this dialogue technique to bring the relationship closer, which is more intimate than the smile and courteous attitude before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try to, but the Duke, you also know that the teacher has a bad temper, we are always vigilant in front of him, not afraid to make the slightest mistake." Lucien cooked The "famous" dominated by the storm is used as a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrison, who followed, decided to watch Lucien for a while before he said: "Congratulations to Evans, I thought you would have a committee teacher, but you can’t think of it. It’s the storm that dominates the Lord. It’s great to be able to get a crown, medal, and other awards before the high level.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly understand that Lucien is to establish his own network of contacts, Harrison's little must-have elimination, much more sincerely since the beginning: "My friends and I are looking forward to discussing arcane and magic with Evans." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music is easy and melodious, the banquet is carried out in such an atmosphere, and Lucien knows a lot of great nobles who have real power or control in the kingdom. Unexpectedly, the Duke of the Bald James has been promoted to the ninth level, becoming a golden knight, and the rest of the nobles are also several. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After the dinner, Lucien returned to Aringe and was preparing to write a thesis in the study. Leo came to report: "Master, one Mr. Lazar's husband came to visit with a group of magic apprentices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their message is very well-informed." Lucien intended to finish After the paper, friends and apprentices were invited to meet to announce their return. I could not think of being visited by Arthur, Lazar and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the arrival of good friends still made Lucien very happy, and told Leo to say: "Come and ask them to come in."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown vest, white shirt, black double-breasted long dress, high hat, Lazar's dress is no different from more than a year ago, the smile is still as bright as the sun, let people see it at first sight Good mood, but Annick, Lei Yiya, Heidi, Sprint and other apprentices have taken a high point, with the appearance of young boys and girls, no longer like half-size children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I didn't inform me when I got back. Fortunately, Katrina was at the front desk of the Magician Management Department, and we realized that you became the storm master. Student!" Lazar gave Lucien a warm hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the apprentices were sneaking, looking at Lucien’s salute with excitement and fear. “Welcome back, Teacher Evans.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The receptionist of the Magician Management Department? Katrina, have you graduated? Cindy and Donna?" Lucien asked slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-four-year-old Katrina, who has grown tall and mature, has become more beautiful after three years of growth, especially the good body that makes Lei Yiya and Heidi A slender girl is often envious and embarrassed. She is very funny. "The teacher has also worked in a magic school. Do you remember that the annual graduation time is June? And we have been enrolled for three years, and we have already completed the advanced. The various exams in the class, and passed the basics of the arcane examination, got the basic arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I mentioned the results of myself, she could not bear Living in front of a teacher who is respected and scared, Heidi, Lei Yiya, Annick and others are consciously upright, ready to accept praise, only Che Li is slightly frustrated: "Only I have not graduated I just entered the advanced apprenticeship class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not a teacher who praises, but a sincere smile: "Although the Magic Council rules for three years, it can be magical." The school graduated, but few apprentices meet the requirements, you are all half It’s very good to get the arcane skills.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher’s praise, the apprentices smiled, only Sprint smiled. After that, I was a little sad and angry and bowed my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his abnormality, Lucien did not ask for a moment, but turned his attention to Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard laughed and said: "Cindy and Donna have all reached the critical stage of promotion to the official magician, so they quit their job and concentrate on preparation, and Katrina As a good graduate of the Douglas School of Magic, I was recommended to this very good position. If it wasn’t for her listening to a few high-level magicians who passed by, we didn’t know that you were back, but also became the disciple of the storm to dominate you, hey, me. I always thought that it would be Mr. Ravendi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outstanding apprentices who graduated from the Magic School can be recommended to the parliament headquarters and the various branches to do a good job, the rest of the apprentices There are similar recommendations, but they prefer to find them themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also very surprised. Right, except for Katrina, Annick, Reyia, you are currently at the headquarters or a branch, or somewhere else. "The things that the storm dominated involved a lot. Lucien was ready to talk about it, and first asked about a few apprentices who had little relationship with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi is proud to say: "Teacher, we are all at the parliament headquarters, I am in the apprentice assessment department, Lei Yi Li Ya in the exchange area, Annick in The mission area, but it's all a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprint jerked up and looked at Heidi. He seemed to be reluctant to accept the help of others, and it was a little shameful to say it in public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to him?" Lucien signaled Heidi to speak out boldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi’s surname is lively, except for the fear of Evans’ teacher, who is not afraid of other apprentices. The voice is crisp and clear: “Splint has too many absentee classes. Was expelled from school, not normal graduation.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Lusien looked at Sprint with a funny smile. This guy is really a rebellious student.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint is so depressed: "The magic pharmacy classes, elements Basic class, magic analysis class, magic structure science I have mastered the information left by Evans teacher, why waste time to attend classes, can you learn higher and deeper content? In addition to the magic practice class, I don't think there are other classes in the school that deserve attention. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a good reason, but I think the old fashioned schools of the Magic School will definitely not accept it." Lazar smiled and interjected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reilly looked a little sympathetically at Sprint: "Teacher, Sprint is because Expelled, so the parliament headquarters, the magic towers and periodicals of various organizations are not willing to hire him. Now they can only be a waiter in a magic restaurant. Can you find a way to help him? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of her, Heidi, Annick, Katrina, etc., after coming to the parliament, they quickly became the youngest winner of the Holm Crown Award, Daao Mr. Evans, a disciple of the surgeon, is a magical person who can do everything!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, I am so good, when I become a formal magician, is it still? I am afraid no one please? "Sprint is proud of the way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not speak, rubbed his chin, and said after a while: "I have an idea a long time ago, but it is a hindrance." After the identity is not enough, it has been impossible to implement. Now, after becoming a teacher's disciple, I believe that it is convincing. Sprint, I am going to apply to set up an Arcane Institute. Can you be my assistant? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Institute? "Lazar and others don't understand this vocabulary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien expresses profoundly: "You are the name of a research project, no. I know that the Magic Research Committee will not give approval. Sprint, are you willing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I, thank you teacher!" "Splint is such a proud person. It is a humiliation to be a waiter. Just entangled for a while and then agreed to it. He comforted himself. Anyway, his teacher, he should be an assistant. Just say thank you. At the time, his eyes were a little red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar thought: "Lu Xien, my mental strength has reached the middle standard. However, due to insufficient knowledge of mathematical foundation and magic analysis, there is no hope of promotion. Can I resign from the will of the element, to your arcane what and what to give you an assistant? I am very admired for your ability in arcane. I believe that long-term follow-up with you to complete the magic experiment and get your guidance will help me a lot. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem, but I have to wait for my application." Lucien welcomed Lazar, who was a second-level arcian and a second-circle magician.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar once again showed a bright smile: "No matter How, I have already planned to ask you about arcane. By the way, the name of the Arcane Institute is a bit of a space, can you change it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices immediately commented on what the storm lab and the Evans Institute had just said in their minds. Lucien thought about it. I thought: "It's called the 'Atom Research Institute'. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds cool. Heidi sighs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet Annick is brave at this time: "Teacher, I don't like the work in the mission area, can you join?" Your atomic research institute? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am missing people. "Lu Xien did not refuse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also want! "Heidi and Reyaliya are purely busy, and Katrina hesitated for a while and expressed his will.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
