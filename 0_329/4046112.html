			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked slowly with Natasha to the lounge sofa: "The 'Yellow White' has suffered such a serious loss, but it still does not give up It seems that their plot is really big. But since they have been traced by the church and the intelligence department, there should be some time to calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the church has already dispatched the night watchman squad to hunt down. Even the bishops and pastors have sent some to the border towns. They must extinguish the flames of the cults. The failures of several consecutive times can't even hit the 'white corner'. 'The cultists, they are crazy and irrational.” Natasha sighed slightly, with a slight regret on her face, seemingly because she could not participate in the battle herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer, and said: "The mad believers of the God of Truth are similar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha walked over to the sofa and turned around: "And the festival is about to begin, and the people who flock to Aalto are more than ever. It is likely to hide the creatures of the dark world, evil magicians, assassins, etc. Because the city guards, the intelligence department, and the night watchman are very lacking in manpower, the maintenance of both the light and the dark becomes very difficult, so I specifically reminded Lucien that you must be careful in recent days, huh, I am still waiting. "You are in concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you can rest assured that I have been practicing with peace of mind recently and are finally preparing for the concert. How can I go out late at night?" En smile responded to Natasha’s concern. "And I have a vigilant sword. The silvery corner is hard to ambush me unless I use the strong knight level. But how can I be a big man in Aalto? , Priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;Because Natasha caught a cult priest last time, Lucien finally figured out the strength of the inside of the "Silver Point", the priest corresponds to the priest, the priest corresponds to the bishop, and the high priest corresponds to the cardinal. The chosen people of God correspond to the pastor of the Holy Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also, Lucien, you are the finale of the festival, many aristocrats, clerics are watching you, the madman in the silver corner is really crazy You will find you trouble. In addition, you don't have to worry, my uncle has sent someone to look after him." Natasha's disguise of seriousness fades and smiles brightly. "Actually, I am from Silvia. After the lounge came out, I heard that you arrived at the association, so I found an excuse to come to see you. I am very curious about the situation of your concert preparation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not worried at all Lucien’s sudden change to the finale of the festival will be very stressful and stressful, because she feels that she will never be nervous when she changes to herself, and Lucien’s experience as a cult test and a crisis of life and death can also be calm and abnormal. A qualified knight, certainly not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Natasha’s curious look with a funny smile. It’s really easy to get along with her. It’s not a special case. I don’t feel the Princess’s Highness, the Countess. The pressure of the five-level knight: "I am ready, now I need to practice with the band. After all, this is my first time as a conductor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your music is very good, and after becoming a knight, the coordination of the surname and the physical movements are enough to be competent in the conductor. Anyway, most of the conductors simply beat and coordinate." Natasha did not care to answer, beautiful purple Looking at Lucien, I seem to want to know the tracks of the Lucien concert in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past when the theme music was scarce, the conductor did not need to grasp the connotation of the music, and the music was more appealing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought that the time for his concert had been confirmed, and then the association would inevitably let himself turn in the tracks, lest the concert problems, so did not hide Nata Sha: "The Symphony of Destiny, the G minor tune serenade, the piano music adapted from the D major Canon, the piano tune adapted from the violin sonata in g minor, and the piano tune of the c minor in the theme music. The name is "Sorrow." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The arrangement of such music is very strange," Natasha said in a puzzled manner. "It is rare to see so many survivors in the concert." Piano music. There are too few symphonies and no concertos, and the whole concert is not grand enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien is ready to explain, Natasha I laughed myself: "But I am very confident about Lucien. Just arrange it. Oh, I am looking forward to your piano sonata. The current genre of the sonata is not mature enough, let alone the theme. Last name, I hope Lu Xien can explore A road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After satisfying their curiosity, Natasha and Lucien talked casually about the recent Alto fun, before the festival A messy and fun variety of simple concerts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it was accidental to discover the whereabouts of the Silver Point, we also considered that they deliberately leaked, thus weakening the possibility of Alto guarding the strength. Therefore, if they dare to do anything in Aalto during the festival, it will surely Suffered a more serious blow." Natasha replied lazily and squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t say much, it’s not just a smart person, the church staff and the knights are not fools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After Natasha and Camille left, Lucien was just about to go to the fifth floor concert hall to practice, and met the Othello director who came to the door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recently received aristocrats and musicians from other countries, and he did not stimulate blood, so the whole person looked very tired, but he still maintained the serious old-fashioned The old-fashioned aristocratic temperament, holding a black cane, walked steadily step by step to Lucien, opening his mouth without expression: "Lu Xien, is your concert track ready?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Othello’s student, McCann, received a lot of different insights and criticisms within the association because of the last time he accused Lucian of failing, and he found an excuse to return to the family territory to avoid the limelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to hand over to Othello." Lucien returned to his desk, picked up the quill, and brushed the track and handed it to Orsay. Luo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello looked carefully and his brows were very fragile: "There are too many piano pieces for solo surnames, not a real, grand concert. I know that genius always has a lot of novel ideas and attempts, but is Lucine really sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a concert in the usual hall , Lucien, a musician who is favored by His Royal Highness Princess, Othello will not take care of it, but this is the three-year Alto Music Festival, the music festival of the whole continent, the concert of Lucien. It is the final finale, and he must not be nervous and concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "I have confidence that my Royal Highness has agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I hope you don't have pressure." Othello expressed his strong disappointment. In his heart, Natasha directly designated Lucien to hold the finale concert on the last day, and Christopher did not stop. It is really ridiculous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, you need a famous, authoritative musician with rich concert experience, instead of arranging the first concert of a genius To try it out, this is not only an adventure for the Alto Festival, but also a heavy pressure on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under the pressure of the musical genius, Othello has seen a lot, so he will be so worried, "Alto music festival is only three days, But the guests who arrive will definitely not leave immediately after the end. It is entirely possible for Lucien to hold a concert after the thrift, which will not only spread the fame but also reduce his pressure."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the association, Othello is very responsibly thinking about it, but as a nobleman who has not stimulated the blood of several generations, he completely dare not rebel against the princess’s decision. Let Lucien confirm it over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to send Othello, Lucien left the room and went to the concert hall. All the musicians and musicians met along the way were difficult to hide. A strange expression greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, like Othello, originally thought that Lucien’s concert was after thrift, but he didn’t expect it to be the finale of the festival, so he was not familiar with the road. Sean's full of embarrassment, familiar with Lucien's, is very worried, afraid that he can not withstand this pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just on the fourth floor, Lucien as a keen keen instinctive, quickly flashed to the side, then a woman rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Lucien to let it go, the two would definitely hit each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Silvia, are you in a hurry?" Lucien saw this in front of the bud yellow dress, the fresh and refined Sylvia. Her cheeks were slightly flushed and she gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia was shocked first, then touched his chest: "Nothing, just walking anxiously. Lucien, I heard that you are Don’t be nervous about the concert of the last day.” She smiled softly to appease Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
