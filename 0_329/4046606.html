			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Cardinal Mission in the Daguangming Hall, in addition to the legendary strongmen such as the Holy Spirit Pastor and the Holy Knight, there are only nine levels of priesthood. Personnel, they are also cardinals, optimistic by the pope and the legendary powerhouses, and are expected to promote the Holy Spirit or the sacred talents, either to run a small parish, or to be responsible for the specific affairs of the holy city of Lance, and the highest congress of the Magic Council The six six-ring ** divisions inside. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Anasta solemnly declares that he is the only one of the world, listening to the beautiful holiness, feeling the warmth and tranquility of the Holy Light, nine Cardinal Philip has only felt that his mind is clear, forgetting that there are other things in the world. In this inexplicable move, he only feels that there is a little light in the soul, sacred and transcendental, and then the light gradually expands. The projection of the seven-story Heaven Mountain, a six-winged angel imaginary flying out of it, blending into the heart of his own faith, so that his soul has signs of sublimation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Daguangming Hall, the squatting body of the ground is dyed with a layer of slowly flowing, never-ending milky light, and the breath is rapidly improved. Become holy and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III saw this scene, his face showed a sincere smile: "This is the gift of the Lord, we have another brother, and one more Purifying the ** of the peers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos and others understand that the long-standing enthusiasm in the "main voice" just finally in the mind "Seeing" the projection of the Heaven Mountain, and promoted the pastor of the Holy Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the Holy Lights, the soul of Philip was gradually clear inside and outside. He looked up, his eyes were happy and pure, and he painted a cross on his chest: "The truth is forever." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the fellows, may our efforts to make the Lord's Word walk on the earth as if walking in His kingdom." The Order of the Knights Templar St. Mermo St. Augustine, the cardinal of St. Mary, and the leader of the monk, St. Austin, led the other cardinal members to congratulate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing III itself is only slightly white hair, this time has a lot of silver, he calmly and calmly said: "The Lord's care has never been reduced, no matter In any crisis, we can finally get through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mermos, you have to look for Terence and others to give to Austin, lead one The members of the Cardinal and some of the monks went to Aalto to help Philippe Bell and Beria. Danisos was a little restless. Maria, you led the two cardinal members to the north to shock and prevent the heresy. Katie, you bring two Cardinal members to Stewart to set up the Storm Channel defense. You must fully mobilize the assistance of the epic knights of all countries." Katie is another female surnamed saint. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no strait four countries and the North Coastal Corridor to be guarded, coupled with the support of the epic knights, the legendary staff of the church is still arranged, not to Lose too much space and territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos agrees, although the legendary powerhouse of the church is concentrated in the Principality of Vaolirit, the northern part of the Divine Hertz Empire The province, Stewart and several important alien spaces make the holy city of Lance and the central region very empty, but there is the Pope's majesty, the king of angels, and the newly promoted power, will not be attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the situation is settled, it will be able to return to the past, with only one in the Vaolire Principality, the Syracuse Kingdom, the Northern Province, and Stewart. The two legendary cardinal members are guarded by the local epic knight. The other members, in addition to a part of the rotation control of the different space, are concentrated in Lance, so that they can be easily rescued and attacked at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Melmos asked: "His Majesty, Pope O'Brien, who is missing, how to deal with the Violet family?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Bing shook his head: "This is Natasha’s personal move, and it’s no problem to involve the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, but if it strikes the entire Violet family, it is easy to cause nobility. Unstable people are not conducive to the current situation, so you and Milton pick one from the line of the Violet family to inherit the position of the Grand Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow you Will." Melmos has no objection, and he does not want to see the family with the "Shield of Truth" as the "Sword of Truth" family to abandon the Southern Church, which will create a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of Benedict III, a cardinal member rushed to various places, the Southern Church lost four sagas, missing four legends, missing The three Holy Spirits, the dangerous situation of the seven epic knights, gradually stabilized, and the Dark Council once again missed the opportunity to bite a church because of internal jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ines and other two Holy Spirit priests returned to Lance and the wise angel Terence went to the Northern Church, the aftermath of the Magic Council's "Mushroom Cloud" plan seemed to gradually subsidize. The Southern Church relied on a kind of god, two legendary peaks (angels). King, Melmos), three third-order saints, fifteen legends, and the strength of thirteen epic knights, still maintain the strongest position, but the gap with the northern church and the magic parliament It has shrunk a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin III returned to the former pope’s study and waved a few The cardinal went out and sat quietly on the armchair, looking at the newly added portrait:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict II, sacred Calendar 602 - 824 years." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his face became pale again, the uncontrollable trembling of the left and right hands, the breath drastically dropped, from the gods to the first level of the Holy Spirit, then He slowly climbed back to the gods. After so many times, his breath gradually stabilized, but his hair seemed to be a lot more white, his eyes were more old and muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘God’ is really unbearable...” He sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recovering, Benedict III’s gaze looked at the room where the “King of Angels” Mecan Tron was located, seemingly through a heavy array of gods and walls. I saw him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The holy beauty is like a woman’s Mecan Tron standing by the floor-to-ceiling window, and the long blond hair is dimmed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not hurt in the eternal blazing sun and the "land of heaven", and he coughed from time to time, spit out the golden blood like a mass of energy, and the pupil seems to A little bit sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such an injury for the "king of angels" did not hurt the roots, and improved at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict III regained his gaze, and his mouth showed an inexplicable smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he stood up and walked to the important filing cabinet protected by the horror gods array and found the column named "Douglas", which was taken from inside. A lot of documents, read it again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The target person does not seem to exclude my speech."... "They often have emotional confusion..." "Maybe he is a little shaken."...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Artir"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book When the three looked at these documents, they took out the report of "The Latest Progress of Arcane Theory" from the column of "Magic Council" and looked at the description of the special theory of relativity, whispering:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there is no influence of Artil on his side, I can see that his sports system has encountered a lot of problems, maybe more time than before, maybe it is time to find a chance and He talked about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Heilz Empire, Ti Fule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the palace, Rudolph II, sitting in the prayer room, suddenly raised his head, and a dreamy wing spread behind him, full of eighteen pairs, and he was puzzled again. Slightly delighted: "Is he injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regaining emotions, Rudolph II closed his eyes, and the whole person's breath became ethereal and ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound, no excess color in the solidified dead spirit world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's bright red coat is unusually eye-catching. He walks in the distorted Rentt City projection and swears himself: "There is something left in Sarde's body." Where did you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left Thunder Hell Returned to the Institute of Atomic Research, and saw that Lazar, Annick and others were all a pair of fearful and happy appearances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
