			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweltering night is filled with a repressed atmosphere, waiting for a rainstorm to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien chose a completely different road from the last time. It took more than ten minutes to walk to the abandoned house with tall willow trees in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien did not go out directly, but secretly observed that in the shadow of the willow, standing three wearing black robes, his face covered by a hood Guys, judging from their height, one of them is Smyr, the other is the Sage, and there is a Lucian who is not sure which magic apprentice he has seen last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the neighborhood, Lucien did not find an ambush, but did not relax because of this, back to the original hiding position, from the belt Inside the row of small pockets, accurately take out a black, odd-shaped casting material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien opened his mouth and seemed to read the mantra, but there was no sound, only the palm of the casting material began to shake quickly, and more The faster, the invisible fluctuations spread out from inside and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scream of the bat", Lucien created his first magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is constructed by the principle of bats using ultrasonic "probe", which is the biological version of the radar, with ultrasound to "detect magical aura "This apprentice level magic, as well as mental power to check if anyone is hiding around." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien learned that "detecting magical aura" knows that magic apprentices and formal magicians have many magical means to hide their magical aura. But under the Sixth Ring, all methods of masking the magical aura require that there is no gain-shaped, defensive magic at the same time, unless it is a constant magic effect, so under normal circumstances, after releasing the magic that covers your own aura, There is no cracking on other methods of exploration, so the "bat scream" is very useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, magicians with different methods, if they know in advance that there is a "bat scream" magic, there is still a way to avoid it, at least Lucien Knowing that you can imaginary, spiritual, and then cast the magic that covers your own aura, so the magical choice of magic is also a large part of its own strength in the battle of the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not in apprenticeship, there’s very little magic about light. Lucien even wants to construct an infrared type of magic that detects heat. After all, there is more kind of scouting magic. More safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of ultrasound waves spread around the black caster material in Lucien’s hand, and when it encounters an obstacle, the part of the wave returns to the black Irregular spherical materials, the mentality of the focus on the top of the road in the mind of the sea gradually appeared in the surrounding scene, even in the dark, it is as clear as the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[With my heart, within a sphere of 100 meters in radius, except for the inability to check inside the house, there are only some mice without magical aura. 】 Lu Xien judged the effect of the investigation, and unfortunately did not create infrared magic, otherwise the house can also see, [wait, there is an owl on the tree, um, is Doro, the one over there In the tree... there is a crow, a donkey, a crow. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing this crow, Lucien relaxed a lot. From the last experience, the owner of the crow should be more suspicious, no Absolutely grasp the people who will not do it, and during this time, they have not done anything, have not had any contact with anyone, and certainly have not exposed any information. It seems that he still wants to test and observe himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending the "Bat Scream" magic, the black magic material in Lucien’s hand is like a dry, turned into a pile of spun yarn from the fingers Slowly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "bat pituitary", Lucien's own mental strength can not support more than a certain degree of ultrasound, can only rely on the bat material of the casting material Complete the whole magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lucien, I’m ready to continue watching for a while, and when there are no other abnormalities, when I go out to meet Smyr and the Sage, another magic apprentice suddenly He made a voice: "Mr. Dear Professor, I think you should have been near, and you may not see it. You may have seen me. In fact, this time I found the evil creatures traced by my teacher. He expressed goodwill to you and hoped to be with you. A profound magician communicates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing her words, Lucien judged it and walked out from the shadow on the back of the house, as if from the darkness, slowly walked down the willow tree: "Thank you to your teacher, although I know There is a pair of eyes staring at us on the tree, but I still hope to express his gratitude to you through you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, how are you? Know?!” White honey was so surprised that she almost forgot to change her voice. She looked at the tree sideways, but in the darkness, she could not see anything. [How could he find Ashley? In this darkness, it also masks the magical light. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this professor, white honey is more mysterious and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow seemed to be struck by lightning and almost fell off the branch. Fortunately, it spread its wings in time, hovered for a week, and went in the other direction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage and Smyr also did not expect that they would be followed by the magician of another magician, staring, could not help but tremble, if it is malicious The magician, the two of them are in danger. They look at the white honey, and the cold voice carries anger: "You need an explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White honey The attitude is very correct and sincerely apologizes: "I am very sorry to conceal you, you can get a gift, the teacher just wants to meet with Professor, if he is in danger when he is catching evil creatures, the teacher can also help through Ashley. However, now Ashley has left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for observing the "professor" of the mysterious magician's strength, she did not say it, but was present at the scene. Everyone understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a formal magician, Sage and Smyr expressed their attitudes with anger, there is actually not much way, the power gap is too Big, if you kill the white honey for this, maybe the crow will fly back and kill himself. So after seeing the white honey apologize and promise to pay, the two nodded: "I hope not to do it again." There is such a thing, here is Aalto. When this happens, your teacher will be considered a church spy and will become the enemy of all magicians and magic apprentices. Last time the witch and the magician from the Magic Council headquarters Being ambushed by the church, many magicians and magic apprentices suspected that there was a spy inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien has come to them, the hoarse voice is like grinding Rusty iron sword: "Can tell me where the evil creatures are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the old house of Baron Laurent in the aristocratic region, their family has three consecutive generations. No one motivates the blood and cannot serve in the Principality. Jobs, have declined, the entire old house has very few servants, very deserted, some time ago when Ashley flew over, I heard a noisy voice inside, because of curiosity, it flew down and saw that it was inside The party of the field is full of men and women with surnames, and some people in the middle of the small altar are trying to collect this power. The man is Baron Laurent. From him, Ashley smells a little evil creature. "White honey will make the story of the discovery more clear, because I am worried about the misunderstanding of Professor:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After a period of observation, the teacher is sure they will be again tonight. Hold a party, and it should be at the crucial moment of the sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sage nodded, the old voice with a lot of emotion: "Many of these nobles, arrived. If there are no knights in successive generations and you can't get holy water from the church, you will find ways to stimulate your blood. Even if you know that you are being tempted by the devil or the devil, you will try it." He seems to have seen a lot. This kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a noble, regardless of the title, or the territory is hereditary, unless it violates the first ten of the sacred law, will be stripped of the title and territory by its own lord, However, if no one has stimulated blood power for several generations, it means that the family has begun to decline. It will be swallowed up by various means in the Ming and Qing dynasties. In the end, there will be only one title of the title, becoming a bankrupt aristocrat. The nobility, and then for generations, even if not deprived, glory will be forgotten, and in the end, it is no different from civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has his own judgment on the passing of the matter, and feels that the "Silver Corner" cult has started to be quiet after nearly two months of quiet. : "Do you know the strength of that evil creature? How do you go to the aristocratic area?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble area is surrounded by the inner wall, this time, the gate is early It is closed, except for the nobility living inside, it is possible for the soldiers to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
