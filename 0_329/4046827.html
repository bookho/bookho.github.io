			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya and Cherie stood outside the small lab, watching the dim light of the "portal" and magical patterns, reluctant to leave half a step It’s like having a cat claw scratching and scratching in my heart, it’s hard to curb my curiosity. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Ophelia next to me said: "We are not useful when we stand here, and we don’t know when they will be able to come back. I’m still busy with my own things. Anyway, Heidi will definitely tell us when they return.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi has never been hiding as long as it is not confidential. Living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there are a lot of scheduled experiments to do, but also to analyze the data, but also to design new experiments, but also to perform magic analysis..." Lei Elia had originally wanted to agree with Ophelia's words, but when she spoke, she felt that her life was "dark". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar slightly nodded and slammed his hand hard. After everyone’s attention shifted, the smile shone brightly: “Don’t die here, etc. Who knows where Evans went, how long it will take to return, first go back and complete his own experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talks to Lucien and his familiar friends They are all directly referred to as "Lu Xien", but at the Atomic Research Institute, in order to respect the "master", when talking with the apprentice-level assistant about Lucien, it is called "Evans." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Lazar." Apprentice-level assistants such as Lowe reluctantly glanced at the small lab and resisted their curiosity. Go to their respective laboratories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't know where the teacher sent them?" Chely said suspiciously to Lei Yi Li Ya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliya thought: "It should be related to micro-level research, otherwise the teacher will not be placed in the research institute and can completely apply for a magic study." The project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them talked and turned around, passionately guessing the "destination" of the teacher's magical array - although Heidi came back after them, You and others will definitely know, but the most fun part of this curious thing is not guessing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lai Liya and Cherie have not yet taken a few steps, suddenly felt the magical fluctuations behind, the induction of the mental field, one in the small laboratory A magical pattern illuminates in succession, constantly extracting energy from the "Allinge Magic Tower", bursting with a silvery and pure light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fantastic light scene, the faint "gateway" regains its brilliance, transparency and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of Evans, are they coming back?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of doubtful and excited voices, slowly returning to their respective labs, Ophelia, Lovi, and other rabbits, came back, the reaction is agile, speed Fast, just like they have been waiting for this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gate of Light suddenly broke out, and the pure and innocent light drowned the entire small laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they disappeared, the "gateway" disappeared, but there were five more figures in the center of the magic circle, Lucien and Annick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, where have you been?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, what have you seen? """<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyaliya and Cherie blurted out and asked about Heidi, who told her that she couldn’t control her mouth!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi has not adapted to the vertigo sent back and heard the inquiries from two friends, squinting at his forehead and smirking: "You must not guess us." Where is it, it is a 'romantic' place. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Romantic? Lazar couldn't help but repeat it. This keyword seems a bit wrong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Romantic..." Lei Yiya and Cherie can't imagine, they There are a lot of guesses, but it’s completely out of touch with “romantic”. This is the Institute of Atomic Research!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the companion's surprised expression, her dizziness disappeared quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Is it the starry sky?" Ophelia asked indefinitely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi groaned and asked in surprise: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it really a starry sky?" Lei Yi Li Ya asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophelia sees everyone’s eyes focused on themselves, slightly shy: "I just remembered an issue of "Allinge", it Investigating the romantic scenes in the minds of many magicians, the number one is to look at the stars at night. This can not only feel the vastness of the universe and its own smallness, but also the detachment of the fate of the river, not disturbed by anything, so I am boldly guessing that you have gone to the stars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The object of the investigation must be dominated by the star magician!" Heidi muttered, "Good. Well, Ophelia, you guessed it. We did go to the starry sky. The teacher built a cosmic observatory there, for us to study cosmic rays, observe the passing asteroids, Lei Yi Li Ya, Cherie, You must not imagine the feeling of being in the sky, it is the boundless darkness, the far-reaching darkness, the stars are like the glaring white spots embedded in it, there is no flickering, as if the paintings are unchanged. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that she was excited: "Only when I really went to the starry sky, can we understand our own smallness, and we can understand the vastness of the whole universe and generate it from the heart." The sense of awe, I feel that the universe is sacred, and it is sacred more than any sacred propaganda god! I have only really understood the words of the Speaker of the Lord who refused to Pope Wicken, and experienced the 'Starry Sea' and used it as How can a target person see the 'God' nesting on this little planet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi's description makes Lei Yiya, Cherie Ophelia and other relatives of the Master's eyes are blurred, as if they are in the starry sky, with the feelings that are difficult to describe, and Lazar, Jerome and other elemental faction magicians are also moving, It seems to have some feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road next to Lucien shook his head with a funny smile. Does the "Cosmic Observatory" have educational significance in this respect? Can help the magician establish a healthy outlook on life, world outlook and values, find the inner feelings of the sustenance, not bewildered by the truth of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, me, when can we go to the Cosmic Observatory?" After listening to Heidi’s description, Lei Yili looked at her eyes with a gleaming look. Lucien, no matter how expressions and movements, can feel the feeling of being impatient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of Cherie and Ophelia, and men such as Lazar, Rock, and Lowell did not say anything and tried to control themselves. The emotions, but their burning eyes deeply "**" them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien chuckled: "This is for you to experiment, and in order to save the consumption of back and forth, you must stay on it for a week, if Just an hour or two, it’s really romantic to be in the sky, but it’s a long time? The boundless darkness, the empty space, the eternal loneliness, will make you feel like you are going crazy, even if there are four Companion, this is not a feeling that romance can offset, you can only adapt slowly, you must also be mentally prepared, otherwise I will not let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Teacher, rest assured, I can't talk for a month without problems." Annick took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lively Heidi frowned slightly, or rushed and said: "Teacher, when we are above, most of our energy will focus on the experiment, and the surrounding area will be empty." , darkness, and loneliness will not affect us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you each prepare a research plan, I choose to prepare the most detailed ones." Lucian smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi "sneakly" said to Katrina and others: "Sure enough, it is a devil's smile..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; For the "romantic of arcane research", they quickly dispersed and began to prepare experimental plans for studying cosmic rays and vast stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lei Riya, wait until the Cosmic Observatory, you will really understand the feelings I just described... I imagined a scene before, that is myself Sitting alone at the Cosmic Observatory, sitting on the ground with his knees, all the ups, downs, left and right are empty and innocent dark and clear and clear stars. There is no creature other than me... If you can see our planet, it would be fine. The kind of loneliness that looks down on everything and transcends anything will be even better!" Heidi can't stop talking to Lei Yiya, everyone has their own romantic feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
