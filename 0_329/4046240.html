			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy Bell, wearing a dark red robes and a soft cap, stood up and took the information from the priest in an unusually dignified manner. It was Nikola. The success of Valente’s assassination of Felipe caused the Magic Council to be angry. So the highest panel of judges is preparing to attack the cathedrals of Holm Parish and wash their shame with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to explain why the magician being bought will pass the information urgently. If the Magic Council breaks through the Glorious Cathedral of Holm Parish, it means very It's easy to find out what they are buying, and for them to make a profit, keeping the confrontation between Holm and the Magic Council is the best option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillie Bell’s eyes are like a “angel” with pure light, sweeping through the intelligence of his hands. He has been hosting the Holm parish for many years and used to it. Dealing with the magicians either explicitly or implicitly, it is clear that they have some sinister and mysterious means, such as curses, such as inexplicable toxins, such as media that cause "invasive mind" magic, so even if they care about this matter, he does not have Relax and check the information contained in the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there were no hidden magic traps, Philippe Bell ripped open the envelope and took out a thin piece of paper to shake it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The element will be a few high-level simulations of the original natural environment designed a simple experiment... Under the observation of many Arcans and two night watchers, there is no In the case of magical interference and spiritual intervention, after a week of circulation, the original source of life was born in the experimental device, including the source of the winter...etc. The two night watchmen and an old magic who believed in the truth. The teacher recognizes the collapse of the world and is destroyed by his own light or spiritual power on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Seven Miles created the world, is it this Seven Miles, Philip Bell Cardinal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of white paper is full of words, the content is not complicated, mainly describes the device, materials and results of this experiment does not seem to be Worried about the verification of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The source of life? The original natural environment?" Philip Bell, the city's extremely deep old man, also muttered like a nightmare. He is no stranger to the handwriting of this letter. He is in the Kingdom of Holm and often has the opportunity to see it. This is the handwriting of Douglas, the chairman of the Magic Parliament, a great arcian who never succumbs to lying and obsessed with pursuing truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he dared to write this, and attached a complete experimental design, the real surname of this experiment is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filier Bell’s hand holding a stationery trembled like a stroke, and the old man on the back of his hand said his aging and powerlessness: “Lord, you Are we testing our faith? Lord, why should we let nature be born to God's miracle? Why should the Lord let mortals enter the realm of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He The "Soul of the Holy Spirit", which is crystal clear and crystal clear, emerges in the flesh. The light of the road makes the study quiet and soft, and the stationery in the hand is held down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to Philip Bell? How can you shake the faith in the Lord!" I noticed that Bilbao, who was not right, was yelling at Bahá'u'lláh. Black ripples appeared on his side, suppressing the burning of the flames of Philip Bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filliebel calmed down and shook his head: "Baha'u'llah, Warren Hill, I have never wavered the faith of the Lord, you don't have to worry about me." I will recognize the collapse of the world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success of the artificial synthesis of urea and fatty acids, I expected that one day I just didn’t expect such an impact. As a result, I almost lost my soul. The mortal began to think about God's authority!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did this information write?" In the words of Philip Bell, it was suspected that it was related to the follow-up experiment of human life mechanics. I thought that this time had "corrected" the cognition on this aspect, and I was psychologically prepared, so I boldly set off the hands of Philip Bell. Stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filibel did not stop, quietly watching Valensil’s reaction eyes became muddy but deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard! This group of evil wizards who should go to hell 10,000 times! They dare to enter God's restricted area! They, they actually let the source of life Born in the natural environment?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the golden blood is sprayed in the mouth of Valensil, and the body shines with the light of the light. He refused to take care of his soul and gnashed his teeth: "To fight in full swing, you must fight in full! Only by thoroughly purifying the entire Magic Council can you restore the glory of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately There were two experiments before, plus no physical objects, experiments, so even with Douglas's "credit guarantee," Warren Hill did not reach the level of heavy damage, let alone swallowed by the Holy Light, but such injuries It was the priest who became a priest of the Holy Spirit who had never encountered it in 169 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the temperament of Bahá'u'lláh after taking the letter, there is no big reaction, just the face is very ugly, a word from a tooth In the seams, I said: "I think we should shift our main focus from the northern heresy to the evil magician of this group of gods. They are already trying to enter the realm of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is an epic knight, the source of strength is his own will and the blood power of God. Although the belief and prayer of God is the main support of the will, it does not recognize things like the world. Even if the cognition is shaken, it will only reduce the piety of faith, weaken the will, and will not let the blood power out of control. At most, when fighting, the blood cannot be perfectly controlled, and the strength cannot be fully exerted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most important thing now is to block the news, stabilize the people, and then slowly change the cognition of the pastor and the bishop on the 'life-giving theory'." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filliebel emphasizes the main issues at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the messenger who sent the letter shook with the reaction of the three cardinal members in the study, did not want to go to see Bahá'u'lláh Letter on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a rush of footsteps outside the study, a red cardinal wearing a red robe, a shawl, and a square hat of the same color rushed in. As a strong man, his expression was faintly fearful and anxious: "The Philippe Bell, a priest in the Glorious Cathedral was swallowed up by the Holy Light. And the cathedrals in the parish have an urgent return, most of them pastor, bishop sentiment Unstable! Although there are very few swallows by the Holy Light, there are only two, and there are very few who dare not pray. There are fewer than 30 people, but they are very confused. I am eager to ask you to confirm the birth of life in the original natural environment. The experiment is fake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Philippe Bellby was surprised to see the letter, how did the Magic Council do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, a newsboy walked on the street with a cloth bag filled with newspapers that had just been printed, shouting energetically: Selling newspapers, selling newspapers, and printing the Holm Weekly in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Selling newspapers, selling big newspapers, big events!" Holm Weekly "Pre-release!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the street, wearing a dome hat, the citizens who rushed to work hurriedly stopped after hearing and took out five copper fairs. After handing over, Holm Weekly will be issued in advance, and there must be important news in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenced by the magic school model, and the research results of the magicians involved in ordinary life, non-subjective surnames, the Kingdom of Holm and several other countries are educated The degree and literacy rate are higher than the mainland countries across the Stormwind Strait, and the circulation of newspapers has a relatively large base. And here is Rentat, the capital of the Holm Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other esteemed people who don’t have to hurry in time are enjoying breakfast and watching their long-time subscription to Holm Weekly. It includes pastors and bishops who are always concerned about social trends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young pastor came out of his room and went to the church restaurant. When he finished the prayer, the bread, sausage and other foods were already set on the table, and a newspaper was placed on the right side of the knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The Holm Weekly? Isn't there another two days?" The pastor casually asked the trainee pastor who was waiting to be served. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor pastor replied with respect: "The pastor, the newsboy who sent the newspaper is not very clear, it is said that a great event happened in Rentat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor snorted softly, spread the meal and took the newspaper and looked at it carefully. The first page is as usual to report that the old king was hunting at the Royal Hunting Ground, many nobles followed, but Prince Patrick did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
