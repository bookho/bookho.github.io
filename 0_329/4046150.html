			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrion, limbs, etc. in Hunter’s body have been burned out, the painful eyes have recovered the ingenuity, and they have slowly climbed toward Karin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a glass tube filled with white powder from his arms, stuffed it in Kailin’s hand, and then placed her in Kailin’s clothes. In front of Hunt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?" Karin was swaying, and a very familiar feeling came from inside the glass tube, which was the feeling she dreamed of every night, often Missing the feeling of tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the transformation experiment of himself, Hunter’s body touch is close to numbness, resisting the pain of burning flames, and using the instinct of Necromancer and blood connection Road: "That is... Little Mary's... Ashes?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mary she fell into ruins, please ask me to send her home before dying." Sean did not talk about the specific process, because a little girl in the black and white gray spirits of loneliness, hunger and pain, hope and finally desperate to spend the last part of life is too cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt suddenly cried, the tears of the two lines mixed with the pale yellow corpse had just flowed out and burned by the flame: "Is that damn lock?" Not only did it waste me more than twenty years of life, but it also made me lose Little Mary." The voice is no longer intermittent, and the light is clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He really knows." Lucien silently said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly burst into tears, full of heartbreaking pain and regret, the blood and tears on her face mixed together, shouting "Little Mary" While opening the glass tube, pour the ashes into the mouth, pour it on the body, then pounce on Hunter and accept the burning of the flame with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans, thank you, let us reunite before we die." Karin hugged Hunter’s head and kept her lips with Mary’s ashes. Kiss his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly looked at this scene, the mood is quite complicated, but still ask: "Mr. Hunt, you are not a person in the town of Bonn? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My home...is Djibouti...the Principality..." He learned that his daughter’s whereabouts Hunt did not persist in his will, he clung Karin and "Mary" seem to be swallowing the last breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a short time since the fire was burned, Karin whispered: “Whether you stay in the town of Bonn, no matter why you yell at me, but I have been Love you so much, love our daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...and..." Hunter's mind became blurred, "Repent... Learn... ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound came to an abrupt end, Hunter really died, and Karin clung to him, ending his life with a small dagger in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames are getting bigger and bigger, and the two bodies slowly turn black into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a cold wind swept away, blowing the black and white ash, a little white light emerged from the air, gathered into a lovely transparent Mary The figure of the girl, behind her is the more blurred Hunter and Karin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl said silently, but the voice seemed to ring in the heart of Lucien: "Thank you uncle, send me home. Oh, I finally waited for Dad and Mom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the light spots dissipate in the wind, but a small part is wrapped around Lucien’s left hand, and finally becomes a pale white Tears imprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as it appeared, Lucien found that his body was under the blessing of "anti-immortal creatures" and also on the surrounding necrotic environment and The rotten corpse has a good resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a constant effect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not expect the Hunter family to stay last The following gratitude consciousness will produce such a change, but he does not know much about the Necromancer magic, but he does not know what it is: "Maybe you can look at Hunter's magic notes, he should compare the things of the Necromancer Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Master Evans." Betty, they said in unison, in their eyes, Lucien is a powerful paladin with many extraordinary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After they arrived, Lucien used only three supernatural forces: "greasy", "fireball" and "super soul". Greasy surgery has no conspicuous appearance and distance is so far away. Betty, unless they are official knights or magicians, they will not find that greasy surgery is the use of Lucien's own, and fireball is originally a magical item, "Super Soul" Don't worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien will not take risks, and so on, naturally look for opportunities to use "charming humans" to "verify." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The lab door in the flame-burning cemetery was opened, and Hunt seemed to be "successful" and couldn't wait to run out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked into the gate, even if you were mentally prepared, Lucien couldn’t help but be disgusted because it was like a slaughterhouse with humans everywhere. The body is full of bloody taste. And most of the bodies are babies, children and teenagers. They are cut into different parts, and the internal organs and facial features are on different experimental tables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After carefully scrutinizing, Lucien found Hunter’s main long table for experimentation, which depicts the most famous life of a dead spirit. tree. The circle of the ten branches of the trees is empty, but there is a black coffin next to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inspection, Lucien opened the black coffin and saw a scene that surprised him, because it was actually the body of Mary, seven or eight The appearance of the old, the face is ruddy as asleep, poked with a finger, there are also obvious physical names and touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirming that Mary’s real body has turned into a bone and was burned by himself. Lucian’s heart speculates: “Don’t collect so many children, the baby’s body is for the body Cheng? But he obviously failed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around for a while, Lucien found two black books in the corner, one for notes The appearance is similar to the book "Astrology and Elements", which is written in the ancient magical empire with three pale words of "The Book of the Dead". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly overturned the "Book of Necronomics" and Hunt's magic notes, and after entering the soul library, Lucien looked at it seriously. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the records in the Magic Tower, the town of Bonn in the Principality of Vaolirit is a mysterious relic that has been locked up in a lock. It seems to be related to several legends in ancient times. The whereabouts of the magician, including the friend of the Wilfried Necromancer 'Prophet' Maskillin. It is certainly not as barren as this magic tower, there may be many magic items and treasures! I am going Look for it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......“The town of Bonn is a beautiful place, the townspeople are simple and conservative, and the girl named Kailin is beautiful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Why are there no traces of confusion? What is the lock? Is it the prophet Maskilin personally arranged?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"I can’t find clues from the background of the missing person. It seems that I can only give up, but I seem to be reluctant to leave the town of Bonn. Maybe I should tell her my true identity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Haha, I have a lovely daughter! Kay I gave birth to a daughter for me, I want to call her Mary. No matter what, the magic of the Necromancer, the mysterious experiment of the legendary magician such as Wilfrid and the prophet 'Maskilin', what powerful magical items, What precious treasures are not important to them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."Mary... Mary is gone! The beasts nearby should have been cleaned up by me! Is it? Is that the lock, or the foreign kidnapper?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."My dear little Mary, you are going home, father and mother miss you. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Kelly cried every day, I think we need a new place to live, I also need a good environment to study magic, see if you can find Little Mary, or, will she be resurrected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."Haha, Baron Habero in the foggy town, in order to continue life and restore youth, actually follow I said, killing his son! With this blood-connected body, he can maintain it for several years. !! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp youth up and I can begin to study the "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
