			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is gloomy, a little bit of drizzle, and everything in Aalto is covered in a gauze-like rain and fog, as if even nature is in sorrow Can't help but cry and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hearse pulled by the four bulls is moving gently, and more and more people are standing on the street with a drizzle, looking sadly. They drove past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crazy, almost concerted city-wide concert in the past few days, the melody seems to reverberate in the hearts of everyone who listens to the music So I learned Lucy? After the news of Evans's death, the shock that has not been forgotten has made them unable to control their emotions, and they are saddened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that Wayne? Evans told them the spirit of never giving up, for the precious pure joy that he brought, they flocked to the streets, for the pride of Aalto, the talented musician Lucien? Evans saw off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drip drizzle hit their faces, making them wet, it seems to be mixed with tears, adding a mourning atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the time is a week later, if it’s not in Aalto, it might be difficult to have such a spectacular scene, the streets that cross the street seem to be crowded with the entire city. People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the hearse away, some feelings are full or on the road to Weston? Evans madly rushed into the streets, drenched with rain, and joined the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a person wearing a black coat and grief-stricken people spontaneously following from different streets, the team is growing stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hearse drove into the nobility, was invited to participate in Lucien? Most of the aristocrats at Evans’ funeral became stunned, because they saw a black-pressed head around the back and behind the hearse, and the endless, innumerable “guardian” was like a black tide with a slight sadness and a deep feeling. Surging forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in addition to the Aalto concert in the Plaza Mayor, they have never seen so many people gathered together for the same purpose, so these nobles It seems that there is a illusion that after the thousands of ordinary people are connected together, a terrible force erupts, as if it cannot be stopped, and can swallow everything on the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think Lucien? Evans is so popular and admired." The aristocrats with knight ranks are much calmer in this scene, secretly feeling, "If at the time of my funeral, there are so many people who can send spiritual and spiritual protection, it is really the greatest glory except the coming of the true God and the lord. Even if you die, there will be no regrets."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hearse passed, the nobles joined the team. This is a part of the funeral of the truth. The people who will attend the final funeral ceremony will escort the hearse to the last leg, instead of being too fond of Lucian. Evans and his music are willing to help themselves with the ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal in front of the Golden Cathedral, Cosse, looked at the spectacular and horrible guardian team, his face changed slightly, and the subconscious made a cross on the chest, whispering Tao: "Only the truth is forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the spirits entered the Golden Cathedral, the ordinary people who were not invited to the spiritual team did not want to leave for a long time, and they were foggy. The drizzle, prayers and blessings around the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the bishops and pastors feel inexplicable, as if a saint is about to be buried inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the auditorium, the coffin is placed under the cross, symbolizing that he is a devout believer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sorrowful stop, Cardinal Catherine holds a milky holy cross, solemnly and solemnly: "The Lord of Mercy and Mercy, this time we are here for Lucy En? Evans brothers offered prayers, he has already finished the journey of the world, and you are picked up. We are convinced that all who believe in you, accept you, believe in you, respect you, follow your path, You will receive your salvation and rest in the mountains of heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats, musicians, musicians, etc. who filled the auditorium closed their eyes and followed prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is a pure, devout, noble person, his music as you teach has brought strength and joy to the world. May he be in your The country continues to offer you a beautiful song..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blessing and prayer, it is a recollection of friends and relatives. Joel, Alisa, John, and Victor have all gone forward to speak and follow Lucien? Evans’s bit by bit, some of them crying, some are sore and restrained, others are obeying the Lord’s teachings to comfort others, so that they can restore their inner strength and better rush to the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the memorial came to an end, Natasha walked to the side of Cardinal Coss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wore a black, conservative dress, her black hair covered with long hair, and her expression slightly sadly recalled with Lucien? Some of the joyful things that Evans got along with, and finally the emotion gradually calmed down: "He once said to me that if one day he fails to make a will, he will die, then he will donate to the 'Brons' manor under his name. Come out and hand it over to the Musicians Association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Othello and other musicians nodded slightly, Lucien? Evans is a purely music-loving person who can donate most of his property, the estate, to the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha continues: "He wants to set up an award and a competition for all the proceeds of the estate. The award recognizes the best music in the continent in three years. The work will be selected by all the members of the Aalto Musicians Association. The competition is the same all-continental piano competition held every three years to promote the development of the piano as a new instrument, to inspire and inspire more people who love the piano. Can really take the road of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brons Manor is Natasha's choice and sent to Lucien, worth thousands of Quintal, The income itself is also good. The annuity is about one hundred Jintales, which is equivalent to the annual total income of a famous musician. In three years, it is three hundred Jintales. For a lot of poor musicians, or piano lovers who have just stepped onto the music path, even if only half of them, it is a very rich bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rossie Evans has a golden heart, and he is always concerned about the development of music and those who love music." Othello stood up and thanked the Musicians Association for his donation. "I propose to name the awards and competitions as the 'Evans Music Award' and the 'Evans All-Piano Competition". At the same time, the Aalto Musicians Association decided for each pair. Musical development has made outstanding contributions or has written a masterpiece of immortal classics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will be built on the top of the Cassia River next to the Belém River, let everyone The people who come to Aalto, and every child who plays, can see them and then know the names of those ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristo Hu and Victor and others nodded: "I have no opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neat and unrelenting applause is very much in line with the funeral atmosphere, noble for a great musician. Character and love for music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Natasha added: "I will also donate the proceeds of a private estate belonging to my private, let the 'Evans Music Award' and ' The prizes for the Evans All-Piano Piano Competition are stable to three hundred Jintales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your generosity from His Royal Highness." For Natasha It was requested that Othello did not object because the prize money was the same as the music prize, because the three hundred Jintales definitely scored one or three prizes, otherwise they would not be able to inspire and inspire the latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, John, etc. have no objection to Natasha’s unauthorized disposal of the “Brons” manor, they believe that the Princess’s Highness will not be because A manor was forged and the manor was given by Natasha to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Cardinal Cossack frowns: "'Evans Music Awards'? This form and the 'Holm Crown Award' of the evil wizards' The Immortal Throne Award is very similar. It seems that Lucien is inspired by His Royal Highness the Princess or the professor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on such occasions, he does not There may be objections, and there is nothing worth paying attention to in a music field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the "Evans Music Award" and the "Evans Polo Competition", the funeral of the funeral is completed, and the people attending the funeral are in the choir The leader sang hymns and blessing poems in unison, making the atmosphere of the entire funeral sacred and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of all the process, Cardinal Catherine sprinkled holy water on the coffin to cleanse all the ugliness and crimes brought in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
