			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard of Lucien, Lilith did not feel wrong, and said with exultation and a bit of shame: "We are going to listen to Mr. Evans. The concert, after Aalto finished the music festival, left again, anyway, time..." She suddenly realized that she was revealing things that should not be disclosed, so she hurriedly shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sarah also felt a problem and looked at Lucien with a dignified look: "Mr. Evans, this time to Aalto They are all coming to the music festival. We are the same. Why are you wondering that we are still in Aalto?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the subconscious and waited. I can't wait to bite off my tongue. If Lucien really sees the clues from the literature, doesn't it be tantamount to confessing himself? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I see that your brothers and sisters are coming to the 'Brons' estate, please read the manuscript, and think that you are in a hurry." Lucy Enshui transferred, looking for a good reason to explain. I was really too big to say just now. The subconscious questioned the doubts in my heart. But if I don’t know that the literature is about a relic that is about to open up, why would I be surprised that the Sarah brothers and sisters did not leave? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes know too much, but it's easy to say the wrong thing!" Lucien self-reviewed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith apparently believed in this explanation. At that time, my brother and sister were really eager to perform, so I was happy and half-truthed and answered: "Because we like Mr. Evans very much. You, so I am anxious to see you. Hehe, Mr. Evans, the melody you played just is beautiful, like a dreamlike natural beauty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After talking for a while on the street, Sarah always felt that Lucien, who was reading the manuscript, was a little uncomfortable. She always feared that she accidentally said that she had missed her mouth and let him know the secret, so she would not want to leave. The sister took it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the backs of their brothers and sisters disappeared into the crowd, Lucien nodded slightly: "The time to enter the magical relics is in line with my inference." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But are you accidentally meeting them today, or are they deliberately appearing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aalto, Under the control of the church, it was unreasonable to be unwilling to take care of anything involving magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Has refrained from his greedy Lucian, and soon forgot the magic relics and continued to wander around with Avon Sometimes enjoy a symphony in this concert hall, and sometimes listen to the opera in that theater, and sometimes add some music games, it is very comfortable and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Joel and Eliza returned with satisfaction, ending Lucine’s “nanny” work, and after dinner, several people went together Go to the Municipal Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual empty and empty city square is now crowded with people, even the nearby streets are full of congestion, as if all the living creatures of Aalto are gathered here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is eight o'clock in the evening, the church will use the divine array to form a huge transparent "crystal wall" in the center of the Plaza Mayor, and float through the space in the air. The crystal walls, the citizens can see and hear the situation of the stage of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people!" Ai Wen exclaimed in a child's exaggerated tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is simply the ocean of human body, although they wear clothes of various colors, but in the view of Ai Wen, it is completely a piece of black pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer smiled and shook his head: "We are waiting here, anyway, the 'God's Crystal' can be seen throughout the administrative district."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s better to appreciate the concert in the Hall of the Holy Ghosts!" Eliza denied the decision to stop, and she used her weight to grind Press a road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien smile stopped her: "Alice is a big man, I will take you to a great place to enjoy the concert of the Holy Hall." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, where is it?" Ivan asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, a five-story classical heavy-duty building appeared in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City Hall?" Joel seemed to understand what it was, and he smiled so meaningfully that he had always cared about Lucien’s marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "Fairy's father, Mr. Yu Erban, is the clerk of the city hall. He invited us to the top floor of the city hall to enjoy. The Shenglu Hall Concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With status, there are connections, and with connections, many things become simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back door of the city hall, Felice wearing a long red dress has been waiting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seating area of ​​the Shengli Hall is limited, and there are many distinguished guests from other countries, so even the nobles such as Erban and Felice have not been invited. Within the musician association, only famous and authoritative musicians are eligible to enter, such as Victor, who has successfully entered the ranks through the last concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien as a music consultant for the future female grandfather, was also invited, but he used his excuse to accompany his uncle family, did not go to the holy hall, after all, tonight The concert is the theme of mass music and hymns. I don't know how many pastors, bishops, and cardinals are going to attend. Lucy, who has ghosts in her heart, can certainly avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At 8 o'clock in the evening, the faint glow glows in the center of the Plaza Mayor, sacred and vast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aalto citizens and outsiders who witnessed this scene deeply buried their heads and prayed and praised quietly. This is the majesty of the Lord. It is the power of the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not have a (read-force) special trip, bowing down like them, full of curiosity and awe of the majestic power contained in the halo: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of magic comes from nature, and where does the power of magic come from? If there is God, why does the church split? I don't know when, I can have such a powerful strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glow is getting brighter and brighter, gradually solidifying and transparent, like a huge crystal wall, no matter which angle Looking at this crystal wall, you can directly see the stage of the Hall of the Holy Grail through it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a choir that is full of golden cathedrals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, devout people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear and beautiful, powerful singing The music is ringing, it is such a wonderful, so incomparable, like the sigh from angels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choirs are all singers. Because they were castrated before puberty, their physiology changed, and the clarity of the song is better than the female surname. A good hymn singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened to the hymns and masses quietly from the perspective of pure appreciation, and had to admit that many of the melodyes were silent and penetrating. The soul is still unable to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the church has more or less the power of the magical array to make religious music more sacred and beautiful. After all, this is an excellent belief. occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time I listen to the hymns of the Alto Festival, I have a feeling of shuddering, this is the voice of the Lord..." The concert ended, the municipality The square is still immersed in the sacred atmosphere, it is very quiet, Felice turned to sigh on Lucien, but also revealed deep fears and worries: "There is such a concert as the beginning of the first day, there must be Many people take Lucien's last day's performance to compare. Even if your concert is already above the standard, as long as there is no such height, it will definitely be violently criticized."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destiny has not received the highest rating? With it, I don't think it will be much worse than this concert." Lucien smiled at Felice, so she didn't have to worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice licked the rich lips: "Lu Xien, you know that I am not referring to fate, but your solo piano. Hey, really. I don't know how you can be so calm, I feel very stressed, I can't breathe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
