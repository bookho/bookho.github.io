			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hip-Hop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eight-year-old boy holds a wooden sword Exhale, open the sound, step down and hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of his age, the boy slashed his sword, and the two swords hit each other, making a dull sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is shining, the two boys are sweating, the water drops along the cheeks to the neck, but even so, they still bite their teeth, eyes focused Performing a sword exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the next step, a blond-eyed man with a slight dagger was satisfied with the practice of the two boys. He looks young and handsome, and his temperament is mature and steady. It is difficult to tell people his exact age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, his eyes are a bit awkward, and it seems that the children in front of him are looking far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John, what are you thinking?" There was a slender, tall woman behind him, temperament, blond blue eyes, different from Holm. style of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John’s eyes returned to Qingming, smiled and turned his head to his wife, Kailin: “I saw the children practicing swords so carefully, I thought of childhood, that At that time, Lucien and I did the same training. I practiced in the open area of ​​the slums of Aalto, but he didn’t have a strong body and no food. Every time I was knocked out by a wooden sword...”凯 < br br 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯 凯One became the deputy head of the Empire Earl, the Knight of Heaven, the Knight of Truth, and the other was even more horrible, the god of the class, the Arcane Master, the Prince of Empires, the great musician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, life is like a drama." John patted his wife around his arm, quite emotionally, "I originally just wanted to be a formal knight. Change the lives of family members, guard them, and guard the Principality. There is no hope of a day knight, nor I’m looking at your wife.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelene is tall and can lean her chin on John’s shoulder. After hearing his words, I can’t help but overflow. A smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John looked at the front, his expression became embarrassed again, and smiled and said: "Lu Xien did not even think that he would have today's achievements. At that time he The biggest wish is to be a civilian with a fixed income. The fate is really amazing. Even the astrological homes are hard to predict. I remember that Lu Xien and I often stood outside the hall of the shrine, dreaming that one day could be inside. Listen to the concert. Oh, I have a little bit of forgetting the look of the Hall of St...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking Alto?" Karin asked sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled calmly: "Yes, miss the hall of the holy shrine, miss the old house, miss the Black Forest where I train for the knight, miss the street everywhere." Visible bards and street performers, hehe. Older people will always miss their hometown and miss their childhood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On age? Yours It means that I am getting old too? I am only a few years old with you.” Karin deliberately shouted, “Do you regret not choosing the territory near Aalto, but staying in Rentat?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he became the count, John had an opportunity to choose a hereditary territory. At that time, Natasha had already served as the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, and he could seal the territory near his Alto. But John finally chose to stay on the Strait of Storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John did not answer, clap his hands and signal the children to stop, then, told them a few words, took Kailin to go upstairs to the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should have a routine patrol." John said in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kailing nodded: "I have already prepared your knight suit and armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;When the hall passed, John pulled Kailin. Pointing inside: "Listen, beautiful music, mother is holding a salon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John also pointed to the position of the study upstairs: "The father should have gone to the musicians association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Karin still does not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled: "Lentage has a magic phonograph, magic air conditioning, home TV, a magic refrigerator, an alchemy car, and many alchemists that have changed lives. Articles are the places where magic popularization is at the forefront, and fathers and mothers are used to such a life, enjoying such a life, and have their own hobbies, and then let them return to Aalto, is tormenting them. Besides, there is now a direct airship, and even if you don’t need to transfer the array, you can arrive in Aalto within a few days, so I never regret my choice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, he added another sentence: "For me, there is a place where you are home. Where do you like it? I naturally choose where I just want to miss my childhood and miss the past. Instead of missing Aalto.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelly’s face was slightly red, without speaking, pulling John back to the master bedroom on the second floor to help him change his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While John was standing in front of the full-length mirror, there was a dull explosion on the other end of the corridor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John and Karin did not react abnormally, just as it was the usual thing to open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ivan’s experiment is a little bit too..." John listened, heard the footsteps of the lab moving around, and then felt Evan The breath of living, then, he sighed a little helplessly, "Because of the help of the pharmacy became the second-ring Master, but he always refused to study the Arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Wen’s character is a break from the boring arcane and magical research, but the pursuit of changeable spells, the colorful universalization of alchemy items, in the words of Lucien, is like The inventor has more than the arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelene comforted him: "Ivan is very smart, but only interested in popular alchemy items, until he understands that there is no deep arcane and magic. The foundation is that he can't effectively carry out his own transformation, he will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kelyn herself is a second-level arcian, four-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." John nodded and put on the last part of the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the Stirrup Forest, John let the subordinate knights sit The aircraft patrolled and patrolled, and they walked in the air, focusing on the situation in the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many elves are integrated into human society, the current guardianship of the abyss gap is shared by the Elf Wang Ting, the Druid Presbyterian Church and the Magic Council, and the Empire The several great knights are responsible for the treatment of the demon creatures or the net demon in the surrounding forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handling of this abyss gap has been full of controversy, and the elves want to seal it completely, as do the aristocrats and civilians in several counties around. The strict guardian also has the fish that leaks through the net. Not only the area of ​​the forest is being slowly expanded, but some demonized creatures or escaped demons enter the country, town or city, although they are solved in time, not too much. The impact can still be caused by disability and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most magicians and knights want to keep this gap and keep the "unknown town" because it limits the power of the invading demons, don't worry about the demon king Or the existence of horror such as the Duke is an ideal tempering place for harvesting many high-order materials. It is not much better than directly entering the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to John As far as knowing, the Supreme Council has made a resolution to set up a research group with the goal of separating the two circles while retaining a buffer zone on the first floor of the abyss for easy adventure and exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh in the communication earplugs of John, his expression immediately became dignified, and the eagle flew down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
