			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of the morning, the night wind whistling, blowing the window to sizzle, it is time to hide in the comfort of the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali can be busy with the "Violet" hospital, but it is difficult to sleep, the confusion of the future development path, the alienation of the nobles who enter and exit the carriage, the alchemy car, the aircraft Feelings, feelings of distance, doubts about whether there will be corresponding gains after struggling, and uncertainty about life, all let his thoughts roll over, and they simply can’t stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey." Ali sighed heavily, rolled over from the bed, put on his coat, and walked to the only table in the narrow house. Picking up the jar, poured a glass of lightly ale into the cup and drank it. This inferior ale was the only "luxury" in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali took the wine glass, went to the window, sat directly on the ground, watching the leaves of the leaves outside the trees swaying in the wind, seems to keep hitting There was some chill in my heart, and there was some sorrow in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His window was a quiet, unmanned street, and it took a long time to see a carriage or alchemy car passing by. The sound is more to bring out the silence of the neighborhood, and across the street is a relatively old building, because it is the worst civilian area, there is no garden and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ali is very clear that the owners of the surrounding houses have not been worse than most of the Lentat citizens in the past few years, and they are more leisurely because their eyes are sharp It was discovered that with the earth-shaking changes of Rentat, more and more foreigners came here, and the newly-opened alchemy workshops lacking manpower continued to recruit people everywhere, so they transformed their houses to The relatively cheap price was rented to these outsiders, and they earned a lot because of the large number of rooms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- After the magical and rich alchemy workshops have all appeared and made enviable achievements, the original textile line will have a sense of crisis and start Please be good at the magician, the magician of the magician to improve the current textile installation. After two or three years of exploration, the efficiency of the textile machine has made an amazing breakthrough. The scale of the textile industry has also begun to expand, and the number of people required has gradually increased. This also brought down the price of textiles. The people of Holm Kingdom can finally afford extra clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sip of ale, Ali pushed open the window, felt the cold wind blowing from the face, could not help but shudder, the inner depression slightly dispelled . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sky silver moon hangs high, cold and beautiful, Ali, who drinks ale, suddenly sees the big dog next to him and looks at the outside. Out of the direction of the city, there was a hint of urgency and eagerness in the eyes, so he smiled and said: "Do you also feel confused in the future? Do you not know which direction to fight for?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is talking to himself. I have never expected the big dog to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big dog gave him a cool look, and he didn’t say anything, still looking at the direction of Lentat out of the city, waiting for the injury. Just flee the dangerous city of Rentatt! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ali turned his head and learned how to look at the big dog. Looking out to the direction of Renttat, looking at the wall covered with silver and white moonlight, sighed softly. Tone: "The wall of Renttat is tall, but it is far less than the invisible wall between the nobility and the ordinary people. It makes people dare not move forward. It is cold and ruthless, tall and strong, and cannot surpass..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not try to organize the language completely, but directly expressed the emotions inside, after all, the audience is a dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really impossible for ordinary people to enter the world of nobility? Why do people have eyes and noses, souls and brains? They can think, but they can naturally Noble, looking down on us? Is it good or bad to decide the whole life?” Ali said that he thought about the nobility and the civilians. He could only accept this natural ruled reality and questioning in silence. Choosing a direction in the nature of the nobility, it is clear that he is not willing to be inferior forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big dog snorted and finally looked at Ali and looked naive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the nobility comes from the power they have, just like the many powerful people of the werewolf family. This is an objective reality, not because some people question this situation. And change. If you want to change, you can only gain more powerful power. At that time, the nobles will welcome you to join their circle so that you don't want to change this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spit out the emotions deposited during this time, and he was in a much better mood. He gradually became excited and restored the vitality of a young man under the age of twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After finishing these, I have already made a decision. I don’t know much about the text at the moment. Maybe I can be at the hospital and the alchemy workshop. Studying at work, but this kind of study is not solid, and I can't let me know what I am good at and what I want, so I have to pay for the general school." Ali stood up and sacredly facing Silver Moon said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the road is very difficult, the distance is very far, the wall is very large, but it does not mean that no Evans is born to the poor, even if you are full of food and wear warm However, I still rely on my own efforts and persistence, step by step become a musician, master of music, magician, arcane master! How can I have the Queen’s gold coin given by my father and mother, and I will be able to get through in a few months. It’s much better to know the school’s money than Ivans’s year!” Ali shook his fist and encouraged himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Lucien is too legendary. It has been adapted into a variety of stories by a poet's brain, and is consistent with the nobility and the civilians. The praise is a very inspirational series. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't have the talent of Evans, I can't be a master in the field of music and magic, but as long as I work hard to learn, I can definitely be good at it." The field has been successful!” Ali knows from the pen confidant’s letter that the current era of talent shortage, even the people who know the text are still very few, the talents who have learned all kinds of knowledge are less to a certain extent, no matter how they learn. As long as you have a little grasp of it, you can't find something that suits your status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you learn well, it might be a magician, a knight, or another profession that can be equal to the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era, there will be no useless knowledge, so although learning is a waste of time, as long as you pass this stage, you will go more than others. Steady and solid, and farther higher! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are determined to make Ali feel more and more beautiful dreams of silver moon, feeling good to the big dog next to him: "If I am a bard or drama The protagonist in the story, maybe I can awaken the arcane and magical talents in the general school, know many friends, and finally defeat the demons and demons who conspiring to destroy the world. Become the legendary magician who changed the times, huh, huh, then you It will become a famous dog in the historical classics, the original partner of a great person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he snorted: "According to the bard Story, you should be a strong and powerful dog, a real magical creature, and the encounter between us will make the wheel of fate slowly turn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He While talking, while checking the body of the big dog with enthusiasm, he finally sighed: "Hey, you really are an ordinary dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking He clearly felt that the big dog's eyes showed a hint of "remorse", hehe, resentment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day is the day of Ali’s vacation. He is traveling with the big dog who is getting better and better in the city, looking for another temporary job, trying to save enough money as soon as possible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Alchemy Workshop? Production of Electronic Tubes? What is this?" Ali suddenly saw an announcement. Curiously took the big dog to this alchemy. The address of the workshop rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the alchemy workshop near the Shing Mun area, Ali strangely saw the big dog buried his head and leaned against him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, afraid of more people?" He asked subconsciously, and then did not pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big dog is Nasdall, he is looking for every opportunity to escape from Rentat, but the reaction just now is due to something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The disgusting vampire also came to Renttat?" Nasdell looked back and looked at the back of the crowd. "Hey, you will die." In the dangerous city of Rentatt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a distance, Nasdell’s eyes shine, because not far from the gate area! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as I escape, I can get rid of the danger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
