			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two silver-black missiles struck a gray arc of carrion owls with a beautiful arc, breaking the glass window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-white owl did not move, and a layer of black, rich gas wrapped the body and let the magic missile hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this understands that it’s not friends who are communicating with Karin, but the enemy, the pointed mouth is open, silent, and the carpet in the room suddenly Unexploded black tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tentacles are dark, dark, illusory, and substantial. Lucien was slightly touched by the moonlight, and immediately felt paralyzed. Weakness, exhaustion and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many effects that Lucien has never seen in the first-order magic, even if the second-ring magic ghoul touch can only paralyze and Produces a small amount of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it unique to the Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooled out of Lucian A fiery flame ignited all the tentacles so that they could not entangle and bind the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weaving Fireman's Bracelet" comes with the second ring magic "Yangyan body". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flame-like defense, Lucien sees the black tentacle still popping up, and the closer the door is, the more it flashes. The faint radiant body turns into a shadow and rushes toward the gray-white owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his own agility and balance, Lucian struggled to avoid the rare but sudden tentacles, and watched the sword slash to the owl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owl in the caster floats and flies up. Lucien slams the entire window and falls toward the castle floor, his body fluttering like a feather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic "feathering". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most important magic in an emergency where a height falls, so Lucien will choose to build its spell model first in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the second floor of the castle is equivalent to an ordinary three-storey villa, but with the feather drop, Lucien will not suffer any harm at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it fell to the ground, Lucien suddenly heard a crazy laugh from the cemetery not far away: "Haha, I am going to succeed, There is only one last step left. Karin, Karin, where are you?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter is getting closer and closer, a Lucien can’t accurately describe The monster appears in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face can barely see the human face, the body is composed of countless rotten meat in different parts, with a horrible eyeball in it, one A half-closed lips, a pale arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light black decaying death gas surrounds him, and the grass that is contaminated with it quickly withers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster Hunt found Lucien, screaming, and the numerous black tentacles on the ground stretched out again, frantically reaching out to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, as soon as I saw this monster, Lucien immediately ignited the second-level magic on the 曰 曰 “, "Resist the undead creature", the body emerged A layer of milky white light that greatly reduces the magical power of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black tentacles entangled into this layer of milky white light, just like the natural nemesis, quickly shrinking and collapse. Lu Xien successfully landed, turned into a residual image, and waved the policeman to cut the sword to Hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster Hunter pointed at Lucian’s sword, waving the vigilant sword and slashing back to Lucien, drawing a deep in his shoulder Deep wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ring of Necromancer "anti-phagectomy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was not affected by the strange changes. After regaining the long sword, the soul model inside the soul was excited, and the monster Hunter and the nearby ground appeared greasy. The color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hunt took a step forward and almost slipped, so he simply stopped and attacked Lucien with a remote magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative energy ray, the flesh of the flesh, the touch of freezing cold, the debilitating ray and other magical images are not buffered and go to Lucien, but Lucian I have fully studied the skills of Baron Aaron and Habero to deal with the magician, keep moving, do not give Hunter the opportunity to lock, and avoid these remote magic, even if it is rubbed into the body several times, there are two-level magic. Resist the immortality of neutrality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Monster Hunter’s eyes are all crazy colors, there is not much reason, but each remote magic is unbuffered to make it physically rotten, eyeballs, lips and The situation that the arms and the like have fallen down has made it realize that it is wrong and it has become violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed, and there were countless black illusory waves bursting around within a few tens of meters, making a wide-ranging attack without distinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Rings of Necromancer Magic "Negative Energy Burst"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of attack is not a strong single, but it is a good way to deal with the Cavaliers. Lucien can no longer escape, can only stimulate the hands of the fire The last "Yangyan bodyguard" remaining in the ring resisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun-like flame surrounds the body of the road, and is quickly swallowed up by the black negative energy. Fortunately, there is a "Linyang bodyguard" in Lucian. Resist the undead creatures, this is barely defended, not eroded by negative energy and difficult to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Monster Hunt exhibited the mid-level magic, the whole body paused there, as if it was a horrible and long spelling buffer because of its ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien, who has remained calm and focused, applied "greasy" to apply a thick layer of grease to and around Hunter. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lucian continued to cast spells, three silver-black magic missiles struck from the air in a thin arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray-white owl took over the task of dealing with Lucien when his master was unable to cast spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to fight with the magician, Lucien experience is not rich, you can use the toes to think of the enemy's magic pet attack, so the foot squats again Turned into a shadow in the open space between the cemetery and the castle, do not give the gray owl to lock their own opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This owl is flying high in the air. It is a waste of time and a waste of time to deal with it. Only a magical missile such a long-range attack works, sleep, Magical spray and other control-type magic can't hit the sky at all. No wonder it becomes a middle-level magician. After learning to fly, the strength will be greatly improved. I knew that I also have a magical pet that can only fly..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a death armor wrapped around it, and my magic missile must be broken at least a few times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Although it is slowly consumed, it is not difficult to kill the magical pet that is not high in IQ. But when Hunter recovers and comes back to a large-scale 'negative energy burst', I will definitely not be able to defend and avoid it. Can wait for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking, Lucien uses a magic missile to weaken the owl's death armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the death armor is weak to a certain extent, Lucien’s left hand clenches the weak dagger and creates a chance to throw it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hunter peeled off the countless rotten meat pieces again, began to recover from the caster buffer, and was summoned by it, and climbed up in the black soil in the cemetery. A horrible corpse, some of which have only white bones left, some have some rotten meat left on the bones, some are highly rotten, nausea, and even a few transparent grievances. Surrounded by Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First kill the owl, or deal with the undead army first? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a long arrow flashing green light flew from the castle, breaking the owl’s thin death armor and plunging into its eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painful screams came from the mouth of the owl, driven by the instincts of the animal, which turned the direction and attacked the enemies in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
