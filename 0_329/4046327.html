			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch came back so fast, so strange, completely out of Lu Xien and Adam's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before starting the intrusion control crystal ball, Lucien carefully checked whether the core of the magic tower had an intra-satellite transmission array to prevent the old witch from incorporating the underground remains into the magic. The tower range, which was sent directly back, the result was very good, and there was no arrangement that Lu Xien was worried about. Who knows that the old witch actually put "position exchange" on his "illusion"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Lucien and others do not destroy the "illusion", she senses that the magic tower will be exchanged immediately after being invaded, if Lucien and others destroy it. "Imagination", she can know the invasion in advance, there is plenty of time to rely on other ways to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch removes the usual madness, she is actually a very intelligent high-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Lucien is trying to erase the imprint in the "Control Crystal Ball", can not be distracted, and will not be distracted, because once Temporarily giving up the "core" and going to avoid the magic of the old witch, there will be no chance, a high-level magician with at least seven rings will cooperate with her magic tower, and he will be a four-ring that has lost all his equipment. Can a magician compete? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe even a magic can't be defended! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ignore the other, master the 'control crystal ball'!" Lu Xien did not look at the old witch, the spirit of the force to the core of the imprint Do not care whether Adam will betray, will not escape, will not delay time for himself, nor will he control the "spell absorption wall", "stone skin surgery", "flame shield", "mechanized mind" "And "Ghost Armor" and so on can block the magic of the old witch to vacate the hand, and will not calculate the time of ten seconds to allow the old witch to cast a few magic, just to concentrate on grasping the opportunity. Don't give up because you want to be small! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old witch began to "position exchange", the fear of backlogging in Adam's heart for many years made him unable to resist a step back, his body shivering, it seems to be at any time Turning his head to escape or kneel for mercy, after sensing the calmness and concentration of Lucien from the secondary mind connection, his fists clenched fiercely, and the deep blue pupils became deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has already reached this step, and it is also dead, and it is dead. Why not fight? Is it necessary to pin your hopes on the stagnation of the knees, the flattering, and the flattering of the opportunity? It is better to die quickly and violently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a five-level knight, whether it’s crazy or not, killing, twisting, falling, never willing to fight Lack, this is the root of a knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low roar is like a beast, and Adam turns into a deep darkness, rushing to the back of the desk not far away, and rushing to the position exchange. Old witch. The black ripples are in the middle of the air. As long as it can block her round of attack and let her fall into the caster's buffer, she can get a few seconds for Lucien. That is the only hope for her own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the darkness that came like a mask, the old witch made a sharp horror, the invisible magical fluctuations emerged, and then the darkness condensed It is transparent, like a glass that has just been fired, and the dark assimilation ripples that swayed out quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of "black glass" slammed down, making a crackling sound, and the pieces were covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is out of shape, most of the body has disappeared, and the remaining head and left chest are still in a glass state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-ring magic "Durager's glass conversion"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to turn a creature or a certain size into a glass shape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just one magic, Adam lost all his combat power and could only rely on the mighty vitality of the Cavaliers to support him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old witch dealt with Adam for two seconds, Lucien’s spiritual field that invaded the core of the “crystal ball” suddenly spread, and began to singularly turbulent, invisible Corrugations are generated, causing the entire core space to violently oscillate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mental Shock", the magical parliament’s last 50 years of skill surnames, can effectively help low- and medium-level magicians erase the spiritual mark in magic items. For the ancient magic items that are not prepared for this aspect, the effect is more remarkable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the old witch's spiritual imprint began to follow the shock, a little sloshing, a little bit broken, but it is the imprint of the high-level magician, the quality is far better than the middle, so that Lucien can not be erased in two seconds . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a battle of thousands of years of magical knowledge and achievements with the ancient magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old witch solved Adam, she raised her left hand, wearing two rings on the index finger and the ring finger, one inlaid with a large lilac gem, dream Beautiful, it is Lu Xi's Holm crown ring "element", the other is a dark blue ring, stars dotted with rice-sized gems, forming a strange pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that she didn’t choose the elemental vortex to deal with Lucien. It seems that the two people are close to the distance, the elemental vortex will hurt themselves. And destroy the "beloved" things such as the surrounding desks, beautiful stone carvings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark blue ring illuminates quickly, a strange chain of countless flesh and blood screams with a miserable cry of soul shaking and shaking toward Lucien go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six Ring Magic "Crying Chain", a spell that is supplemented by damage, bound, cursed, and interferes with spellcasting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tangible, invisible crying sounds around Lucian, wants to get into the soul, let him focus on failure, and can not erase the crystal Spiritual branding inside the ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Spell Absorbing Wall", which can be improved by the Magic Parliament Speaker Douglas, can no longer only deal with magic below the four rings, but can absorb any level of spells, as long as Do not exceed the upper limit - the energy of a common five-ring magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crying Chain" wraps around Lucien, the flame shield is quickly extinguished, and the spell absorbing wall draws in part of the chain and countless cries. Flying fast and expanding, the mysterious magic runes are like a baby growing from a baby to an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, the spell absorbing wall is completely ruptured, turning into a piece of light butterfly flying up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has earned a precious second for Lucien, the mentality has become more and more violent, and the spiritual mark of the old witch has become more and more cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spell absorbing wall disappears, the stone skin disappears, the chain binds the body of Lucien, the curse festers his flesh and blood, and the crying sound affects his Brain and soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hormone secretion of the brain was replaced by a mechanized mind, leaving Lucien with a major part of the impact - no matter how low the level of magic, as long as it is used well There is a miraculous effect on the surname. However, the ghost armor is quickly shattered and shattered. The soul of Lu Xien seems to be surrounded by the ghosts of countless screams. The feelings of stinging, shocking, paralysis and so on have emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Lucien, the soul has reached the level of five under the "wake treatment" of the old witch, plus "cry chain" Was weakened by layers, the soul actually kept the calmness necessary to cast spells in the feelings of stinging, paralysis, etc., so that the mental power fluctuated to reach a peak, and the old witch's mark suddenly vanished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old witch’s experiment ended up hurting herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize the opportunity, Lucien’s spirit is cohesive, leaving his own brand at the core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball bursts into a bright, glaring light, rising from the desk, reflecting the magical array, magic patterns, etc. at the core of the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who was tied by the "cry chain", read a simple mantra against the crystal ball, and a magic rune was suddenly shot on the left wall. The entangled black mystery light is just above the cries chain, and both disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-ring magic "high-level magic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the blood-red chain disappeared, Lucien once again read a hard spell, and the right wall shot a deep, faint ray that directly hit the old witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven-ring magic "anti-magic ray" can cancel the magic effect on the hitter and produce a small anti-magic field, so that the target is within this range Unable to cast magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
