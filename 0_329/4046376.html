			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a simple speech, Xiangla picked up a light black magic robe and put it on Lucien:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Exploring the mysteries of life will bring true immortality!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien leaves in the core of the magic robe according to the tips of the Xiangla communication technique Spiritual imprint, got information about it:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imperial Throne Award robe 'source', seven perfect grade items (one layer seal), need to be promoted High-order can unlock the seal and exert its full power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After putting on this magical robe, you can wake up all the dead bodies within two kilometers (high strength) Except for the dead spirits of the order and above, and order them to fight for themselves; after wearing this magic robe, can make it into any shape, high-level magicians and mages will not be able to detect if they do not check carefully; put on After this magic robe, if you die, the soul will be blessed and hide in the magic robe once someone else tries to control it. The core of the robe can be used to change the soul of both sides and occupy the other body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magic robe will also provide the magic resistance of the five-ring magician, level three The great knight's defensive ability, through the powerful death energy, can display five rings of magic 'soul shackles' three times a day, 'spiritual transformation' three times, seven-ring magic 'recession ray' three times (sealing state, paying mental exhaustion completely exhausted The cost of unrecoverable time and the great damage to vitality can be used once in the seal before the sixth level.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In October 819, I would like to use this magic. Robe thanks to Lucien? Mr. Evans made a great contribution to the origin of life. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The origin of life contains a source of immortality! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Gao Qi? Cromwell"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put on the "source" robes and couldn't help but smile and shook his head. "Pale hand" is stingy, magic The surname of the robe is really ridiculous, even the ability to deform the appearance is also one of the constant effects, and the two five-ring magic is almost chicken ribs - the soul shackles can pull the enemy soul out and imprison a piece of his own It is mainly used to torture intelligence, unable to target the soul that has not dissipated after death; the magic transformation is to transform ordinary undead and self into a ghost state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien also hopes that the "Pale Hand" can constantly supplement the magic of life and broken limbs, so that he can use the Holm crown ring without any scruples. As a result, they have not considered their actual needs, and awakened the dead spirit. Controlling the necromancer is almost useless. After all, this is not the fighting style that you are good at.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the seven-ring magic and another constant effect are still compared to Lucien. Satisfied, "decay The ray can ignore most of the defenses like the "Sword of Darkness", allowing the hitter to seal a level. If the hitter does not have the corresponding ability to resist, then drop the level again after twelve seconds, unlike the Dark Sword. The point is that it can be restored without special rituals, it can only last for five minutes, and there are corresponding magic such as "ruby reversal rays" and so on.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to hide in the core of the magic robe and wait until someone tries to control the magic robe to occupy the other's flesh" makes Lu Xien feel "despicable" and "shameless", but has to admire it as a great means of life-saving, desperate adversity The last line of "brightness" is in line with the style of the pale hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please Lucien? Mr. Evans shared with us his feelings after winning the Immortal Throne Award and his thoughts on the magic of the Necromancer. "Shan Gera can't see any expression because there is only a white bone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​the magic of the dead spirit? Lucien swears, step forward, Seeing Felipe’s expressionless face, Sosa flashes red eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The immortality of life is the ultimate pursuit of Necromancer, but we The mysteries of life are still poorly understood, and this is an unknown area that we deserve. Lucien simply said, "Why can blood cells be inherited?" Why can it be integrated? For example, what is the manifestation of old age at the cellular level? This requires us to explore one by one, and the means we explore limit our progress, and this requires the cooperation of other faction magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any kind of magic does not exist in isolation!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief speech, Felipe suddenly saw Lucien walking straight toward himself, with a gentle and suspicious smile on his face, and asked in confusion: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember we had an appointment." Lucien smiled very brightly. She didn't see Felipe when she spoke. I almost forgot about it. Fortunately, I thought about it. I am a great good news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s pathologically pale face changed slightly: “Do you need to prolong life or increase your soul strength?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was mentioned by Lucien, he immediately thought about it. After being assassinated by Traquel, he was in a hurry to retaliate and threatened Lucien to submit a paper on synthetic urea. The promise of a ritual promises to help Lucien or Lucien's friends extend their lives or increase their soul strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Improve the soul strength. I just opened up the soul potential, so the ordinary magic ritual has no effect." Lucien smiled and looked at Felipe . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe's eyes narrowed slightly: "The pale hand has several special soul rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;But very expensive! However, since the promise was made, Felipe, a proud magician, would not repent, but could only bear the burden. In the last two years, the cell memory surname and the improved life concealment (special rituals of internal transactions, only belong to the pale The high-ranking magician of the hand can redeem, which is extremely expensive.) The proceeds on it must be paid for! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly regretted that he was too impulsive at first. He thought it was only a three-fourth-level ritual of prolonging life or enhancing the strength of the soul, at most 20,000 An arcane point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is really a thank you, it’s best to hold it these days, um, in Allinge, under the supervision of my teacher." Lucien Smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands in Felipe’s pockets clenched into fists, and I couldn’t wait to punch the sound of the “satisfied” smile on the road, the sound is like a seam Inside: "You have to give me five days to prepare the materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I am waiting for you, Mr. Felipe." Lucy I’m in a good mood and don’t mind Felipe’s attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe saw Lucien turn and prepare to leave, and his mood gradually calmed down. Suddenly he was shocked and blurted out: "Your cognitive world is initially materialized?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise else he is eager to improve the strength of the soul? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe is very clear that the magic potion is never for himself and Lucien, a genius who is valued by the parliament, organized, and taught by legendary magicians. The problem, the speed of improvement of the soul and mental strength depends only on the idea of ​​the teacher and the teacher's suggestion (the general legendary magician does not agree with the rapid improvement of the students in a short period of time, and believes that the foundation is not strong), the difficulty is always in the cognitive world. Initially materialize and parse the six-ring magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can help in these two aspects, only relying on their own efforts, such as their own artificial synthesis of oil, the cognitive world is initially substantive, so short Within a short period of time, the soul and spiritual strength have reached the requirements of promotion, and they have successfully advanced through the magic ritual. Of course, after years of tempering their own mental strength, they are already close to the standard, so Lucien wants to improve quickly. It is impossible to rely solely on pharmacy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——In the mid-level magician, Felipe got the guidance and secret help of the "Desperate Lich" Congers, becoming a high-level magician It didn't take long before he became his student. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head and thought about it. He smiled ridiculously: "You... guess."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can this kind of thing be explained to competitors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!" Felipe sneaked angrily and became more and more sure of his own thoughts. The speed of the promotion of this damn guy is too amazing, right? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a discontinuous assumption from energy or an electronic discovery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloomy face, Felipe's thoughts ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
