			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next month, Lucien is like a confident and sensible Borak, spent most of his time tempering blood, familiar with power. On the other hand, the rest of the time lingers in various banquets, and the lively cover has reached a preliminary "contract" with many aunts and noble children. They can only return to the remote villas of Borak in a short space. The effects of "fake death" and "strong sleep" and supplemented him with nutrients, lest he live starved to death, there is not enough time for the magic experiment of blood transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, the sky is dark, the lead cloud is crushing the city, the wind is cold, it seems that the first big snowstorm since the winter is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorse family was built in the ancient villas of the ancient magical empire. There is always a sinister atmosphere, and the ancient and decadent taste seems to be able to use the nose directly. Breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the all-black knight's suit, Lucien was tall and slender, and his pace was firm and strong, and he walked into the bottom of the main house basement with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several gorse family members who have gathered here to see his temperament, whether he is not annoying or supportive, he is gently Nodding, such performance can be regarded as an excellent member of the gorse family, and there is a "qualification" for the title of Count Tiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In just over a month, Borak was able to adjust his own state so well, hey, he motivated his blood?" Fort Earl Nuremberg? Fan? Anjo almost forgot to put the big "Buriana cigar" into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the strongest in the gorse family after the two golden knights, and the eight-day knight is "small starlight", so there is no deliberateness from Lucien. The posture of the mask, the frequency of blood vessel expansion and contraction, etc., judged that the other side has the strength of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the gorse, the seven-day knight "the month of order" Ulrich answered affirmatively: "He got some relics from his father, This has successfully stimulated the 'Silver Moon' blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beckman is favored by his uncle, there must be many treasures." Nuremberg looks like a smile To the Duke, they have the same blond blue eyes and deep outlines, but the Duke's hair is already somewhat gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncle in his mouth is the father of Ulrich, Beckman, etc., the last Duke of the gorse, rumored that he once wanted to leave the title to Beckman However, in the test of the underground palace, Ulrich, who suddenly broke the strength of the five-level Grand Knight, successfully defeated the official Knight Beckman with many items, thus establishing the identity of the heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Marquis family’s Marquis and Earl looked at the old duke with the same strange expression, and they even suspected that Beckman’s early death was the old duke’s Hands and feet. Borak, who can't stimulate blood power, is naturally not valued by him. But now, a calm, confident and powerful Borak, how will he treat it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indifference of the superiors of the Duke of Ulrich, Ulrich, said: "Although I don't like the person who relies on the item to win the final victory, the winner is The victor, without any condemnation, will surely get everything that should be obtained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disgusted but arrogant but fair and flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really good." Nuremberg laughed with a sigh of relief, and he was holding some doubts if he was arrogant and righteous. In particular, the speaker is still the Duke of the family for nearly forty years. There are many enemies in the sacred Heilz empire that are eyeing the gorse family, not to mention the ambitious and inscrutable emperor, who can let the family through the wind. The rain and rain have developed and grown, and Ulrich’s ability is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial emperor Rudolf II, the first ancestor of the shrine family, was the only horror who could be promoted to the legendary field on the throne of the emperor. He gave it to himself. The title is quite eccentric, "new law creation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation of several big men in front of the weird stone gate, Lucien couldn’t join, got their jaws and said hello, and they had arrived with Claire, Ray. Erf and others stood together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clair and Ralph both pretended to be a hostile attitude with Lucien, and did not say a word, the scene was quite silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to go in too?" Nuremberg saw Josélin, Duda and other noble children all armed, and asked in a confirmed way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black body armor of Duda is like a can of steel, his voice is heard from the mask: "Yes, Earl, I am only a little bit Become a formal knight, my father hopes that I can inspire the potential through this underground palace test, and I believe that the magical array of the underground palace of the Gorse family can send us out in time, with multiple injuries and no death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more fear, the more emphasis, Duda "perfectly" reveals his own concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, in addition to the magical array protection, 'Glory Crown', Lord Midalun is also guarded in the underground palace, the scene will not go out of control." Nurembek and Du Da's father, Earl of Porti, had a good relationship. The smile calmed his hidden tension, but did not say that there was a hidden protective force in the underground palace to prevent accidental death. After all, the aristocratic children who participated in this test were behind the forces. Strong, the gorse family is not afraid and does not want to offend them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Newlenbeck’s words, Lucien closed his eyes and concealed his sudden, dignified gaze, 'Glory crown' Midalun is still in the underground palace ? Things seem to be a bit of a hassle and setback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one of the two golden knights of the gorse family. Because he is nearly three hundred years old, he is much older than Nuremberg and others. For you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the glory of the crown in the palace, we are completely relieved." Du Da nodded on behalf of a bunch of noble friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the aristocratic children who followed Alten had many strengths with formal knights, and they were inspired by themselves, they fought against the Dark Mountains and the Shahran Empire. Compared with the nobility in the frontiers of the Vaurit Principality and the Imperial Northern Province, they lack practical combat training. Even if they are thrown into the forest for training, they face only ordinary monsters or beasts such as goblins and kobolds. Knight-level enemies fight and experience bloody horror scenes, like the flowers in the garden, and the brilliance of their own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, they are about to face the real battle that can seriously injure themselves, they are inevitably full of tension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Dada, Jocelyn sees Newlenbeck’s eyes shifting, revealing a gentle smile: "The Earl, I am already a formal knight, I want to My fiancé is fighting together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rosy close-fitting lock exposes her beautiful figure, which provokes many of the nobles behind Alten The eyes blinked and often peeked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altenton smiled and filled with a strong sense of happiness, and Dudda and other noble children focused on Lucien, wanting to see him. What kind of frustration, pain or anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just smiles at their performance, like watching a sleepy opera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of reaction made Duda and Alten very disappointed. A nobleman named Andris couldn’t help but sarcastically: "Bolaq, you are really one." Ms.!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no blood and impulsiveness that a man should have! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this brown-haired young man, Lucien used Borak’s attitude: "I hope you wait for me to beg for me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what kind of battle does the guy without the Cavaliers fight? Extraordinary items?" Andris deliberately angered Borak, his eyes focused on his belt. The storage bag, is there a good thing left by his father in the rumor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can guarantee that you absolutely don't want to see them." Lucien put the crown ring, the scorpion scorpion, etc. in it, and used the cannibal Magic gloves, frost swords, dodge boots, etc. cover up, anyway, the underground palace test is not forbidden in extraordinary items, after all, non-high-level basically can not use high-order and above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Andris couldn’t stand Lucie’s attitude, the entrance to the basement came in again with a lot of people, and the ponytailed Denny walked in the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, dear Borak, I am here to help you." Deni greeted him without any scruples, but everyone’s attention was not on him. It is the pure and beautiful blond girl behind him, the only daughter of Rudolf II, His Royal Highness Princess Sophia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
