			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This slightly awkward magnetic sound, this undisguised worry, makes Downey and the fat body all stiff, slowly turning his head, and surely seeing one Karl, who was attacking the black magic robe, looked at the scene of the accident with sorrow. The two beautiful eyebrows were gently wrinkled, and people couldn’t help but want to smooth them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man doesn’t understand what the accident has to do with Karl, so he can’t speak, and Downey knows clearly that this one attracts everyone’s attention. "The stunning girl" is the "murderer" of the magic laboratory just before, so he took a moment and couldn't bear to comfort: "Karl, as long as you strictly follow the experimental norms, the college will not punish you, you Is it a violation of the rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Carl shook his head firmly, then buried his head, his voice became smaller. "I thought there was a high-level magic tower." Protection, there will be no problem, the college must know that it is me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey quietly sighed, but fortunately he did not violate the operating rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not Downey’s affirmation that Carl will not be pursued by the college and will not be dropped out of school, but at least he can now have a reason to comfort Karl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you know it, you didn't violate any of the regulations of the college. Hey, you shouldn't be bullied..." Downey said ambiguously. It means that Carl's background is strong and there is no reason to expel him. The Heidler School of Magic is bound to suffer tremendous pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Downey couldn’t judge the strength of Carl’s rings, badges, necklaces, etc., he was still keenly aware of the terrorist power they contained. This is by no means affordable for the magic apprentices of the general aristocratic or high-level magician background! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kar gently decapitated, frustration and sorrow faded a lot, said to himself: "I have been taught so many times by Lu Xiaoen, too Not bad this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xiaoen? This name is eccentric, completely incompatible with the lingua franca. Is he Carl's father, brother, or other elder? Downey screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the experimental accident just made out?" The fat man who didn't have a sense of presence listened for a while and got this amazing message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl gave him a look. The beautiful silver-purple eyes suddenly became sharp and abnormal. Downey didn’t feel anything about it, but the fat man’s forehead burst out with a lot of cold sweat, and he never dared to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Shirley from the Principality of Waorit came over from the crowd, with a smile on his face with the rest of his life: "Don Ni. Just thanks to you, if you didn't find it in advance, we are afraid that it has been destroyed together with the laboratory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this, me, I am just luck Ok." Suddenly thanked by a girl. Donnington was flustered and stuttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next to Carl said: "He doesn't find out, I will also remind you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is very small, and the scene is thunderous, and Shirley can't hear it. He still smiles at Donnie. "This can be attributed to luck. After that, what did you mean by organizing the evacuation without panic?" Hehe. At that time, you are totally different from you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie slightly blush, learning Sami's movements, scratching his head : "I am also saving myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the thunder that continually exploded suddenly disappeared, showing a quiet silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices stared blankly at the sky, only to see the gray fog, let the clouds lose their vitality, and let everything fall into the eternal silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lock is unlocked. The danger is lifted... I can't think of the last use of the lock." The fat man said thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the lock of the Heidel School of Magic? The apprentices are not clear, just hear about the Necromancers such as the "Miranda Life Twelve Rings" The array has a close relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at the fat man strangely, didn't know when he came out, but the scene was quite confusing, and she didn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Shirley disappear into the crowd. Downey just turned back and saw a pair of blue eyes looking at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you watch?" Downey was shocked. When did this fat appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat boy is envious: "The girl just seemed to have a good impression on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We didn't know an hour." Donny suddenly turned red and explained in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, it’s a good feeling for you in an hour. It’s too embarrassing." The fat man followed Downey’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie is ashamed and annoyed: "I mean, there is no good feeling, just a classmate who knows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat turned to look into the distance: "Her roommate should be a girl, please introduce it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Downey I can't say anything. Who is this fat man who is familiar with it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven’t pursued girls for two?" The worry on Carl’s face disappeared, his right hand holding his right hand and his right hand rubbing his chin. Look at people who have no experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I, I..." Downey wants to say that she has had a love experience, but eventually I don’t know why Sprinkle this lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is even more surprised: "How do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvinwen smiled quietly: "When the girl thanked the girl, Downey’s reaction was the standard inexperienced person. He should take the initiative to ask the girl to invite him to have lunch and thank him. Then he would return it again next time. You can hold hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Active? "Fatty sincerely asks for advice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karl smiled slightly and proudly: "Well, take the initiative, don't be afraid of shame!" My father once told me a story. A hunter accidentally found a rabbit crashing on a stump, so he was there every day, waiting for the next rabbit to die here. As a result, you can imagine that Want to harvest love, the boy has to take the initiative, do you still count on the goddess of luck, which girl himself hit your arms? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at such a pure and quiet "girl" is talking about the skills of boys pursuing girls, Downey feels what is called uncoordinated, what? Called a violation, and quickly interrupted Carl's words: "You seem to be very experienced? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl lifted his head and looked at the sky: "Of course, I can have experience!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if they were afraid they didn't believe it, he paused: "Do you need me to demonstrate?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty expects and excitedly wants to nod, Downey is the first to say: "Forget it, there was an experimental accident, we have to wait for the college's handling." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Carl's look dimmed, and his head looked like he was looking for an ant on the ground.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty also wakes up: "Then I will go through the newsletter's pass out and go back to the bedroom to say this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃. Which bedroom are you? What is your name? Downey asked inexplicably.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty: "..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he sighed One voice: "Forget it, I will never have a chance to take the initiative before solving this problem..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of the Sky, the Allinge Magic Tower.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi’s looks are almost the same as it was twenty years ago, still It is a long-haired linen, a baby face, and a few playful freckles. The only difference is that the badge on her chest has become the arcade of eight silver stars on the black background and the black badge of the nine black rings on the silver hand. There are also a few radiant rings, a Holm crown ring with light blue gems, and a crystal-clear Evans Arcane Award ring, which has the benefit of going out of adventure. There is a product of self-refinement.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi took the black tea and took a sip: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a fabulous red light on the ring, then gathered together, launched In front of Heidi, he presented an illusory publication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi has a white glazed red teacup on his left hand. The right hand gently clicked on the "light curtain" in front of him, so the "book" turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tragic, the worst accident in twenty-one years..." Heidi read the title of the news, and then the corner of his mouth evoked, and the smile could not hold back." Turned to the corresponding page number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha." She smiled and squatted on the table without an image. "Thanks to my interest in body structure and genetic factors, I have been edifying Tao Xi’s interest in body structure and genetic factors. Otherwise, this little guy will be mixed with the Atomic Research Institute. The teacher has to thank me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler School of Magic. The magic tower that seems to connect to the white sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal, Xiangla, is holding a golden singular earpiece, using the unique indifference of the lich’s voice: "We decided to let Blaise drop out, it is dangerous." The source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a steady and majestic male voice in the earpiece: "I don't agree with your decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Xiangla silently said: "This caused the most serious accident since the college was founded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male voice calmly said: "In the Before that, did I officially inform you about Blaze? Have you told me that there must be a high-level magician looking at it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But It is in the high-end magic tower," Xiangla explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male voice solemnly said: "This is your problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is yours Attitude?” Xiangla’s voice became colder and colder, and was treated by a young man in this tone. He was the Archmage. The heart is naturally a little dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male voice smiled softly and then majesticly said: "Yes, this is my attitude. Of course, I can be responsible for the loss of the experimental tower. But the cloth Leitz’s treatment must be withdrawn, and there is no other choice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will draw up a list.” Since the man has made concessions, Xiangla also No longer insisted, the situation eased the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the list is directly to Blaise." The male voice said with annoyance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to pay so many gold coins?" Carl looked in front of him. The list is a very painful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xiangla is cold and cold: "Yes, either compensation, or withdrawal, you choose, of course, your brother will give money first, he let me tell you, You have to return him from the future income of the Vaughan Principality and your small treasury. This is the first step in growth, called 'responsibility'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Carl seems to be crying soon: "I, I compensate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lowered his head as if the world was about to be destroyed and went back to the bedroom, nothing Said, lying directly to bed to sleep, which makes him accustomed to his voice always ringing Donnie and Sami are quite uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, they also know the results of the college’s processing, and they did not mistake Karl for being fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sleep, there will be Mr. Felipe's open class tomorrow." Downey said excitedly to Sami. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami nodded. During this time, he seemed to be more and more mentally weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark red eyes, the breath of silence...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
