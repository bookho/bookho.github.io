			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guru loosely repeats: "Through the Shahran Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien His own group of panic attacks made the thugs outside the compartment all soft, and the gentlemen who bought and sold information in the compartment were scared to come out, so they did not walk into the room, and they stood in their long dress pockets leisurely. In the aisle on the second floor, Gu Song, who looked back at the wall, laughed: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, through the Shahran Empire, to the northeast of the Dark Mountains A country that believes in different gods. Mr. Gusong, I think you can see it too. I am a magician. I will be pursued by the Northern Church of Truth in the Shahran Empire. Therefore, I need a familiar Geography of the Shahran Empire. , aristocrats and probably customary guides, so that I can walk safely in the Shahran Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mouth of Gaston, the church’s focus is slowly shifting, the storm After the strait blockade became more stringent, Lucien did not take the risk of leap, but listened to his advice and took the magic steaming. The train, passing through the Kingdom of Holm and the Kingdom of Colette, arrived at the deep sea port of the famous city of the North, and then spent more than two months walking through the depths of the forest, trolls, orcs and other places that often appeared in the North. Came to the east of the exile, where the southwest of the virgin forest is the flame fortress northeast of the Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, Lucien built a spell in his soul that was very important to the three-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the Shahran Empire, on its southwestern edge is the destination of Lucien, the Principality of Vaoli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past smuggling of the North and South Church confrontation is more dangerous than the Storm Channel, but after the church’s shift of focus, the latter has become much more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the interpretation of the lie, Gusong probably understood the requirements of Lucien, and he took a deep breath and restored the stability of the head of the intelligence organization. "This gentleman, are you worried that long-term flight in the Shahran Empire is easy to find, need a fake identity and help you cover up the wizard different from the style of the Shahran Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gusson, you are very smart." Lucien smiled mildly, but his heart was in the belly, if my flight could have the speed of the plane on the earth, that is, the degree of high-level magicians, It took three or four days for the flight to stop, but so far, his own flight is equivalent to the running of a regular carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gusong sees the road, Sean’s attitude is calm and graceful, and he intuitively thinks that he is not the kind of sorrowful magician. After sinking a bit, he said: "Sir, I suggest you." Going to the Taran Bar to find Leo, who used to be an assistant to a big smuggler in the Shahran Empire. The business once reached the pagan country in the northeast of the Dark Mountains and the heresy of Waorit, and later offended the big smuggler. He was killed by the whole family, and I was fortunate enough to escape to the Valley by the precious magic scroll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire of revenge and the strength of the quasi-knight He struggled to survive, madly going on various tasks, trying to save money to buy precious magical potions to improve his strength, and then go back to revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is good at Using non-magical means to change your looks, you are very familiar with the aristocrats, fortresses and most of the geography of the Shahran Empire. It is the most suitable candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien thought about it, the smile did not fade away: "I am not too put Leo, after arriving at the Shahran Empire, if he encounters the big smuggler, he is likely to be out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, sir, Leo is A person who has the spirit of a knight to keep his promise, as long as you sign a magic contract, he will not violate it. Perhaps it is because of this, he will offend the big smuggler. Sometimes it is not good to have principles." Once again, "he is definitely the most suitable candidate. Others either have no experience of crossing the Shahran Empire, or are exiled nobles, and can't do good guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucien seriously thought for a while: "Then I will go to see Leo first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't let you down." The tone is affirmative. "It’s just that he seems to have something out there recently. I don’t know where to go. The only clue is that someone once saw him at the Taran Bar.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; just finished, he saw Lucien whether it was the left eye with a single lens, or naked Right eye, brown pupil is like a whirlpool Wang rapid rotation, so that my soul and spirit uncontrolled into it, followed by a burst of confused thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is the winner of the Holm crown award, it is not clear to what extent the North and South churches have mastered their appearance, and a magical masking technique is easily seen by the five-level bishops and vigils. Lucien himself is not good at deformation. Magic, so when I went out, I made some camouflage items that didn't involve magic, such as the insole that grew three centimeters in the shoes, such as the brown contact lenses made with the deformed evil pupils (there is no effect of enhancing vision). It's just transparent and soft. For example, two beautiful mustaches without scraping, with a pair of glasses, are more gentle and polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Gusong looked like he woke up from a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened just now? What about the two knights?" Gu Song said, his head began to hurt, as the head of an intelligence organization, he I quickly realized that I met a strong person and simply gave up thinking. I only remember that a magician came in hard. As for what happened after that, he asked what he could not remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thugs lying on the floor of the hall gradually faded into horror. Just now they seem to have encountered the most fearful things in life, such as the legendary dragon, so scared The soul is not attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You bastards, hurry up and clean the hall, and change your clothes!" Gusong smelled stinks, screamed in a very bad mood, then told the hand Going down to find the two knights, worried that they would be assassinated by competitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Taran Bar, the owner’s own bar in the East." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the log sign, the mouth slightly pumped, then pushed the bar door and stepped into the complex bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enrollment of Lucien, countless eyes looked at it almost at the same time, but at the touch of it, continued to talk loudly, as if that one The silence of seconds never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucine controlled the ancient pine housekeeper Tony in Cross Street, he did not cover up, and showed his strength in a big way, and the two were scared to escape. The Cavaliers were also seen by many people in the East, so some very restless guys in the bar probably knew that Lucien was a stronger man than them and didn't dare to provoke him. Most of the rest did not know who Lucy was, who did not know his strength range. After seeing the guys did not move, they gave up their plans and prepared to observe for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the law of the East! An outsider who has no strength and has no relationship has only died. Even if the inhabitants of the East is exiled, if they are abandoned by their companions, or if they do not know how to please the strong, they will not end well. This law is so naked and cruel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people in the East Exiles want to make a lot of money, and quickly buy channels, go to rules, have laws, and don’t want to be normal. National life, a small number of hobbies killing, bloody, wanting unfettered freedom, admiring the strong and respected people are crazy to love here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When walking through the narrow aisle between the bar tables, Lucien seems to be not here, still maintaining a calm posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I want to inquire about one thing." Lucian knocked on the table at the bar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the young blond man of the bartender wiped the cup without lifting his head: "You need a glass of wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a glass of Les." Lucien knows that this is the general rule of all bars, there is no objection, and a cup of wine that can cause him to miss, this is the first thing I heard after coming to this world. Kind of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond young man finally looked up, he had a nice face and a slightly embarrassing temperament that was in line with the East, and then fell to Lucien. A glass of golden wine: "Do you have anything to ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not drink, but looked at the golden color like a work of art Liquid: "I want to know where Leo is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people have been looking for him recently." The bartender did not answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien no longer looked at the wine in his hand and looked up: "I am an employer and intend to hire Leo."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bartender faintly said: "Others are also coming to 'hiring' Leo." The tone is a bit ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
