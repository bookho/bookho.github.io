			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cave is dull and dark, only the faint glow of the fluorescent moss is a little bit, almost reaching out to the fingers, but Lucien has moonlight and dark vision, as long as it is not There is no light at all, you can see it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, deep pupil, the reflection of the spirit of Angus, it is like a candle that sheds tears, swaying, and finally extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord will return to recovery?" Lucien's tone was low and solemnly repeated, which is the most impressive memory of Angus's anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence, its emotions are violent ups and downs, full of fear and piety, excitement and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a real change in the depths of the dead spirit... Is the truly immortal existence about to recover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien certainly does not think that the "Lord" in the mouth of Angus is the God of truth of the church. He must be the object of the high-level undead worship in these dead spirits, but what is the "master"? The true God is still similar to the existence of Etna, the ancestor of the vampire, or simply virtual, a symbol of some change in the realm of the dead, is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have the ability to indulge your soul and memory like the soul of the dead, you can’t get all the details from the high-order undead “brain”, even because of Lucien and it. The gap between the steps is not big, and it is not good at this kind of magic. Even a little more detailed memory can't be read. The only certainty is that the depth of the dead spirit has really changed greatly, if it is allowed to develop. Very, very bad results may occur in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the acquisition of this information dispelled most of Luis’s suspicions about Rhein, but he still can do it for this mission. I don’t want to be reluctant. After all, I’m just a high-level magician. It’s too reluctant to get involved in this legendary event that seems to be able to subvert the world. If the danger is too great, it’s better to submit it to the top judges with seven adventurers. The eleven legendary magicians are on top of it, and they will feel a lot of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This high-level undead is actually Felipe's summoning creature, hey, he still doesn't know the eccentricity of the dead world and his own contract creatures..." Lucy En smiled and shook his head. In addition to the message that "the Lord will return to recovery," Angus's deepest memory was to ridicule Felipe's arrogance and stupidity, and to curse another high-ranking undead called Ador. Purified, killed by the legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien couldn’t help but sneer, "The pale hands seem to know the existence of the dead, but they have concealed this information. Down, I want to explore on my own, but unfortunately it seems to be used and deceived by the high-ranking undead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the mission is not completed, try to provoke pale The high-order undead in the dead spirits hidden inside the hand reveals the existence of this strange world in front of other people in the magic parliament, thus revealing its veil. Only in this way, they will offend the dead and dominate the dead. God Lich, don't take this risk when there are other ways to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in comparison, it is more direct than Lucien It is much safer to report the situation when the Supreme Council is in session. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand slowly grips, a bright flame burns silently in Lucien’s palm, completely destroys the spiritual dust remaining in Angus, then Lucien Aberdeen carefully cleaned the traces of the nearby battles so as not to be recovered by other high-ranking undead in the Necromancer world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, Lucien continued to move deep into the ground with the help of the "Peeping Eyes" approach and alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the shimmering light, Lucien walked in countless roads for more than ten minutes. Gradually, the air became warmer, a little ear There is a voice of the dark river flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that they are close to the underground city of the dwarves, Lucien is more cautious and carefully turns over the fork in the road, and suddenly he is cheerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a huge passageway, seven or eight meters high, twenty or thirty meters wide, and the walls and walls on both sides are covered with large gray stone bricks. A deep black stone pillar stands in the center, supporting the top, dividing the passage into three, and at first glance, it gives a grand shock. The dwarves have made such a huge passage in the ground, what is their city like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of fluorescent moss is on the ground, growing on both sides of the wall, reflecting the passage of the faint blue light, sly, sly, seems to climb out of a body at any time, a ghost is floating, full of Quiet and gloomy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien carefully explored with the peek of the magic eye, stepped into the channel, the footsteps were unusually slight, but clearly audible, hehe, 哒哒哒The echo is vented in the passage, empty, cold and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling the body, Lucien speeds up, the footsteps disappear, and the whole person flies away without seeing the scope of the gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ferrous metal rails on each side of the passage, which seem to be special vehicles for transporting goods. Lucien is flying forward along them, very I quickly saw the exit of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien consciously slowed down and cautiously guarded, and the news from the glimpse of the magic eye can be seen, in front of a dead group of buildings, they It is located in a huge cave that has been artificially transformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock wall or stone pillar that was specially reserved to support the cave top naturally divided the cave into more than ten blocks, and the tall stone houses collapsed or overgrown. The weeds look down on the streets where the owners have not walked for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s heart-rending that there is a metal pipe connection between these stone houses that protrudes from any position in the house and meets the huge metal pipes at the top of the cave. Then, it extends to the tall buildings that are standing with countless chimneys, then climbs up and plunges into the top of the cave, not knowing where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the dead and cold streets, Lucien sees the familiar metal objects such as bearings, springs, pistons, gears, etc. on the ground, just like going back. Above the earth, entered a mechanical factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint glow flashed through the black grass in front, Lucian bent down and smashed it like an archaeologist, this is a huge rocket barrel Steam rifles, although the gear structure has been rusted and corroded, but they can still be seen in their complexity and compactness, and also connected to a half-size steel high-pressure steam backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ice-cooled rust-stained body that was about to break, Lucien sighed softly because it represented the disappearance of an ancient civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before human development and development, the dwarves who are good at crafts have invented various steam engines and established a brilliant steam civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with their little ones, there was only one overwhelming airship that sailed over the stormy straits and the endless oceans. Steamboats, as well as horror cannons that can be stuffed into several people, powerful steam rifles, steel smelting factories and machinery factories that are like black smoke, are so huge, as if they were made for the dragons. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves have no deep theoretical guidance, relying solely on the summarization of the talents and experience of smelting and manufacturing, they have magically slowly developed steam civilization, with each The knowledge of mechanical forging and design, even the legendary alchemist Klaus's improved magic steam train and the airship used by the church and the magic parliament, in part of the structure, referenced the dwarf's legacy, but switched to Driven by magic and magic power, the huge airships and steam trains have become normal, more practical and cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this civilization has been lost. If it is not seen from the high arcane and magical libraries, Lucien is not known at all, even Lazar The knowledgeable magician who grew up in the Magic Council never heard of it. He thought that human beings first invented steam trains and used them to transport goods. Of course, the magic steam train was indeed the first invention of Clos. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no such thing as Douglas’s questioning, the steaming invention of the dwarves has reached a certain stage and has fallen into stagnation, while the magical biological cycle last name in the dark mountains The expansion of the ground has taught them the lessons of blood. These horrible high-level creatures are not a concept with the low- and medium-level magical creatures they used to bully. They simply cannot rely on steam rifles and giant ship cannons. The time, the glorious steam civilization has retreated to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ground is not suitable for the development of steam civilization, plus the existence of many monsters, hunters, experienced the era of dragon rule, natural elf civilization, werewolf After the rise, probably in the early period of the ancient magic empire, the steam civilization completely disappeared. Only the dwarfs left on the ground had the blood power through the transformation of the crazy magicians, and they had the spiritual power to re-develop the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without the power to guard your own civilization, you can only die in the long river of history. Besides the learned magician, the long-lived vampire, the dragon, etc. Who remembers?" Lucien sighed softly, and the mood was quite complicated. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water of the history of the river seems clear, but under its surface, I don’t know how many brilliant civilizations and powerful people have been inundated...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down a huge steam rifle, Lucien continues to move forward, from time to time bending over to pick up the remnants of this lost civilization, with silver coins painted with strange hammers and gear patterns, There are "Primary Mechanical Forging", "Steam Rifle Manufacturing Method", "Several Steam Engine Detailed", "Steam Engine Ship Analysis", etc., and other dusty books that are full of dust and almost decaying, and various mechanical creations with unique styles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, the dwarf text is better preserved. Today's dwarf language is not much different from these words." Lucien turned over a few books, according to the habit Save them in the soul library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes in the "lost civilization", Lucien saw a huge metal "magic" on the ground, half leaning against the tall The factory building stopped, and carefully observed the internal mechanical structure it exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Golem", the final sustenance of the steam civilization dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to create such powerful weapons of war to defeat the magical creatures of terror, but unfortunately the slow devils failed to do what they wanted, but they gave it to the later Inspired by the magicians, they developed powerful heroes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a sharp voice feedback into the soul of the Sean, the crystal ball in the palm of the hand slammed a piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A peeping eye is killed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! The cry of crying like a weeping sound, the footsteps of the scalp and numbness are far and wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked up and saw a large pale tentacle sticking out of a factory building in the distance, and then a disgusting monster was drilled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper body is like a full-fledged old woman, obese and ugly, two small gap-like eyes flashing fierce light, naked huge milk * room is densely packed It is black and white, while the lower body is like a white octopus. It grows one tentacle with a sucker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nest Mother"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "near mother" of horror and nausea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can create thousands of tens of thousands of fallen monsters, and if there is not enough food, the fallen monsters will swallow each other, or develop towards the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under its call, the tide-like fallen monsters come from all directions, and it is difficult to calculate the number. There are even many shooters and talents that can be attacked remotely. Warlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his right hand and rubbed the badge on his chest. Suddenly, a crystal aura spreads like nowhere, and soon develops. To the 500-meter range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible blizzard picked up, and only a fallen monster condensed the frost, and then the ice sculptures were smashed under the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone arrow shot from a distance has just entered the range of ice and snow aura, and it freezes layer after layer of ice, unable to fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missiles such as missiles, cobwebs, and rays are either crushed directly by the blizzard or interfered with the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien flies fast, and the aura moves with his madness. The tall buildings of the dwarves were frozen by the frost, and the pieces of the fallen monsters, like the grass that met the wind, fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest mother noticed that it was wrong, the tentacle stretched out, began to climb and jump, and the densely packed black and white eyes were sprayed with acid, spider web, fog, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These supernatural forces solidify and fall into the powder as soon as they enter the frost aura. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
