			<div id="content">Sandra looked strangely at Lucien: "Mr. Evans, what's wrong with you?" She didn't feel that this sentence was worthy of surprise. The place, and does not seem to contain any useful information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I used the 'element' ring, the counter-attack was very serious and it took several days to recover. I just softened it." Lucien extended his hand. The "Vicken's Special Summoning Ceremony" that fell on the reception desk in front of Alex took it and pushed his anomaly to the aftereffect of using high-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after the rest of the carriage and the magic steam train along the way, Lu Xien has recovered almost the same, the reason why he could not control himself in an instant is out of order. Because the disappearance before the Twilight War was not only Wicken alone, but also the "prophet" Maskillin and other legendary magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte, Sandra understand these things, but there is no detail that Lucien knows: Prophet Maskillin is missing in the "dead world" In the depths, he was accompanied by several old friends mentioned in the notes, and they are all carrying out an important magic experiment, and Maskillin can use magical means to make artifacts, and his logo The surname of the Great Cross is very similar to the Church's Truth Cross! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lucien have to think of it: "Is Viking one of the old friends of Maskillin? Also involved in that important magic experiment? Does the magic experiment have anything to do with this special summoning ritual he wrote? The depths of the dead spirit really hide the most essential mystery of a certain world! But it must be very, very dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I can become a great arcane master or a legendary magician, I must go deep into the depths of the dead spirits." Lucien decided to conceal this very involved matter and planned to wait for himself. Enough strength to invite the legendary magician and the great arcian to travel together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucian’s explanation, Charlotte and Sandra have no doubts, but think it’s normal, and there’s no serious cost to using magic items. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, Charlotte, we have submitted the mission report to the parliament, believing that the high-ranking gentlemen will start investigating this special summoning ceremony, so No matter how curious we are, don't try it. I am worried that it will be controlled by monsters like Bill.” Sandra reminded Lucian and Charlotte that she is a magician who is good at summoning. The summoning ritual of understanding and the unpredictable and erratic consequences have instinctive resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slightly: "I won't try this summoning ceremony until I become a high-level player. I don't think I can deal with that monster now. And before that, I believe that the parliament can study a lot of things, maybe we only need to read the confidential information in the high arcane library to understand everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the best, you can understand the details of the monster, you will not feel strange and incomprehensible when you encounter it." Unknown enemies are often more fearful than known, Charlotte The War Mage is most worried about encountering monsters other than understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra smiled slightly and relievedly: "Yeah, we have a parliament on it, don't need to worry too much about this, but I still want to borrow." "Fable Fable" to read it and see if it is as dark and desperate as Scott said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same, but I need to borrow a few This other book.” Lucien told Alex to find the basic arcane books of the Force Field, the Necromancer, and the low-level magic books of several other factions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte puts on the War Mage Cap: "I have other things to deal with, let me go. I am honored to meet Mr. Evans this time. You, I hope to work with you in the future, I am very fond of your calmness and decisiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also went to the Aringe City Library first. Ivan Mr. Si, you are not the kind of arcane master who can only survive in the magic laboratory. It is very reassuring to cooperate with you." Sandra, who is smart and strong, did not drag the water, and bid farewell to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien responded to them one by one, modestly: "Your combat experience, your choice and use of magic, I have gained a lot. Without you The help, this mission I may have died in Bertrand Castle. Oh, in fact, there is no need to wait for future cooperation, we can often communicate frequently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;The solemn and majestic bass melody was sung by a slightly hoarse and surnamed female voice, as if to outline the black clouds and the low, dark and oppressive atmosphere before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is getting louder, revealing the feeling of softness and sadness, then the melody becomes rushed, full of anxiety and urgency, like the raindrops and the raindrops Windy wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the contrast between repression and anxiety is reproduced, suddenly everything is quiet, only a gentle melody is coming, as if it was in the storm The soul of the power, in its own feelings, forgets the lightning and thunder, forgets the darkness of depression, forgets the storm, and forgets everything else in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm once again blew the face, blowing the heart of this repeated singing, but soon the first movement ended, the warm melody slowly slumbered, soothing the exhaustion of the soul And trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha sang the main theme of "The Storm Sonata" with a smile, and then looked like a letter that could penetrate the darkness and look at the hand again. This is the one sent by Lucien on July 30, and is very satisfied with the storm piano sonata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it feels worse than grief and moonlight, it is still an excellent work, inheriting the kind of thinking and fate of life. The fight is really good as a gift for oysters.” Natasha whispered, then looked up and read what she had read before, such as Lucien’s teaching with “question sea tactics” (zhe) Mo) Apprenticeships, such as the various funny reactions of apprentices, such as the same name and the same name, were invited as K to participate in the "Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference" accident, and Lucien's other encounters in the Magic Council Little things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things come slowly, like a distant friend who talks about all kinds of things in person, let Natasha feel the warmth and tranquility from her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do I think it would be more interesting to watch these things than to sing music? Is it because there is no communication here for a long time, so there is a problem with the psychological situation?" Tasha's right hand rubbed his chin and asked himself in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The month of the flower (May), the weather is getting hotter, but the Aringe at the height is still cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garden Villa Magic Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s left-handed white tear marks bloom with a soft gleam, and the virtual shadow slowly floats up, and then the sun stone powder is placed around. The magical materials were put in a specific order under the direction of Lucien, and the fluctuations produced by the quirky and sinister spells were combined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a complex refining, the pale white tears became like a substance, and the light was soft and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien’s crystal ball in his right hand is like a spot in the dark night, where the stars are constantly moving into a meteor, flying together one after another, and then forming A star map pressed the tear-printing envelope into Lucien's left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璀璨The starlight shrouded the lab, and when it disappeared, Lucien’s left hand did not have any mark, but with the direction of Lucien’s will, Jingying The transparent white tear mark is inexplicably highlighted, leaving the surrounding life full of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first constant blessing of the refining of the imprint of the little girl Mary, according to the book of the Book of Blessings. Childlike gratitude, can effectively resist the rotten corpse smelling dead environment, and enhance a little defense against soul attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complete this blessing, Lucien spent a total of two hundred arcane points from the Battle of Bertrand Castle. The subsidies given by the Magic Council and the will of the elements did not delay the learning of the field, the death of the Necromancer, and the slowing down of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Lucien has a total of one hundred and two arcane points, and has built five three-ring magic: "Secondary cage", "protective energy damage" The "frozen curse", "secondary mind connection" and "lightning", the second ring magic has also been upgraded to twenty, of which several magic is re-constructed after the elimination, so that their low-level magic is more comprehensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean up the items, just left the lab, Lucien saw his housekeeper Charles come over, he is a very spiritual half-old gentleman . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
