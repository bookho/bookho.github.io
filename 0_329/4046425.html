			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the situation is, Natasha’s situation, I’m not worried about it now, and I’m not even rushing to the rescue... This idea emerged, Lucien ruled out distracting thoughts, and his whole heart was placed on the summoning ceremony, Prince Dracula and Silvermoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the pressure and horror of the legendary peaks were blocked by the defensive array that the observers completely ignited, Lucien did not receive any pressure or interference, no need Try to concentrate, wait until the distracting thoughts are removed, and the eyes move up. After seeing the bright lights of the castle remain with a layer of silver moon, the soul naturally feels the inexplicable connection again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can still feel the silver moon, although the power of the summoning tactics is not strong, but at the level, it is not much worse than Dracula! There seems to be a little imprint left by the god of the moon, Aitna!" Lucien quickly made a judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge bat wings cover the sky, and Prince Dracula looked angrily at the little bugs in the castle, suddenly turning into a rich darkness, completely wrapping the surrounding space. Cut off the connection between the castle and the silver moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was unable to see through the bugs of the worms despite being blocked by the defensive array, but within such a short distance, with the connection between the first generation of vampires, He can confirm that it is not Rhine, so the mood is both good and bad. The good thing is that there is absolutely a problem in the Rhine. Otherwise, a small bug will not be completed to complete the ritual of summoning the ancestor. You don’t have to worry about breaking the aftermath of the observer castle. Is a small bug also dare to count himself, but also dare to summon the sacred and supreme silver moon god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dirty souls are also associated with the ancestors?" Prince Dracula’s crimson pupil looked coldly at Lucien, but saw him not at all. Affected, hands raised, eyes closed, the magic robe drifting in the wind, the monocle reflected the light, the mouth issued a series of deep bloody ancient characters, even into an ethereal mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blocking the connection with Silvermoon can also be summoned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mysterious ceremony This incomprehensible mantra and the wonderful soul mark are all unique to the Rhine. Prince Dracula has repeatedly sneaked into the castle and failed to find secrets. It is difficult to communicate directly with the sacred ancestors. I don't understand the situation. At this time, seeing a small bug is closer to the god of silver moon than myself. It is difficult to restrain the anger in my heart - even if he can't make contact with Yinyue, he knows more than he knows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head is slightly lifted, Dracula makes a silent scream, and everything in a dozen kilometers or so turns into a powder without warning, only the observer The castle and the cliff it was in were covered by a photographic mask and still survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reticle of complex structure is screaming, broken and swaying, and seems to be broken at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in such a dangerous and exaggerated situation, Lucien is like watching because he cannot directly feel the power of the soul and the power of terror. A film with amazing effects, the mind can't be stunned, and continues to feel inexplicable, concentrating on the mantra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little silver moon glimmered at the foot of Lucien, and soon re-formed the bright and white aperture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you contact? A small bug can also summon the ancestor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing In between, the darkness surrounding the shroud became a group of bats that covered the sky. Each of them had a skull size, a sharp mouth, and bloody light, which covered every corner and fell onto the mask. Then, the mask is quickly dimmed at a speed visible to the naked eye, just as the energy supporting the defensive array is inexplicably absorbed, and the effects under stress, just killing a weird bat, there is a new generation from the darkness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of Prince Dracula is beyond imagination, and it can absorb energy directly like blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The call from the blood, pray for the ancient reappearance, let the deepest and deepest darkness be pierced by the silver moon..." Lucien simply closed The eyes, did not go to see the crumbling, it seems that the mask can not hold in the next second, continue the mysterious mantra, into the state of the ethereal and wonderful soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask is faint to the limit, but it is not broken, and Prince Dracula seems to be disturbed by the mysterious mantra and the silver moon. It should have been patiently attacked. Slightly impatient, the overwhelming giant bats flew up and gathered together to turn into a red mouth that could swallow the entire castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, a broken sound that seems to sound from the depths of the soul appears, and the mask is turned into nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The defensive array is seriously damaged, reducing the intensity of defense..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alchemy Life Meter The dull voice of Halic just sounded, and the second layer of defense was directly penetrated by bloodsucking and fangs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien felt that he had a strange sense of looking down, clearly within the castle, being attacked by Prince Dracula, but as if An inexplicable height, looking at him indifferently, and seems to have seen a lot of vague and difficult to describe, blurred scenes, they extend in all directions, and all possibilities are covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red mouth that swallowed the sky disappeared and turned into a tumbling darkness, with a huge palm of pale skin protruding from it, and the nails shimmering sharply below . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn little bug, I want to see who you are! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is expected to support a few minutes of the observer castle, under the legendary peak of the terrorist strength, only blocked for thirty seconds! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy fluctuations of the broken mask disappeared, and Dracula would have to see the little bugs below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he saw a small silver moon behind the little bug, and the weak but chaste light shrouded the bug Inside, isolated all the snoops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small silver moon is getting bigger and bigger, just like the real silver moon comes directly to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky at this time, just clean and beautiful, the silver moon in the brightest moment disappears miraculously, only the sparse stars will illuminate the night, no As for reaching out, I can’t see my fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silver moon behind Lucien, a blonde figure emerges, the scarlet eyes are clearly visible, cold and indifferent, deep and inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of this blonde figure, Lucien’s soul detached from the strangely overlooked feeling, feeling that he was wrapped in the mighty dark power. And this dark power is not the slightest evil, but with a touch of warmth and tranquility, as if the arms of the loved ones at night, and the last sleep of life, is full of sacred supreme taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I saw this blonde figure, Dracula’s deep red pupil was swept by a panic, and the two dark bat wings behind the sky swiftly fanned. I have to shuttle to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bugs actually summoned the ancestors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little bugs without the noble blood of the bloodline actually summoned the ancestors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inexplicable sense, Lucien waved the right hand that had just been lifted, and the blonde figure with the ordinary long sword behind it also followed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silver moonlight that illuminates the entire sky suddenly appears behind Dracula and directly splits him into two halves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, in the horrible screams, Dracula’s two bodies smoky, twisting together, and then without delay Shuttle into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi'an regrets that his strength is still too weak, even with the advent of the "Silver of the Silver Moon", Aitna can only be slightly injured. Dracula, of course, Dracula is probably not so horrible for thousands of years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as the legendary vampire prince, Dracula even if he directly faces the "Silver of the Silver Moon" Aitna, it will not be as The power of resistance, even for a long time, has the opportunity to escape, but the blood of the first ancestors to suppress the first generation of vampires, the fear engraved in the depths of the soul, so that he has no fighting will! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this blow, the vast and innocent divine power left Lucien’s body, rising with the silver moon, and blending into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the real silver moon that had disappeared before reappeared in the sky, but the blond figure appeared vaguely inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
