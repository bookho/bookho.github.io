			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Blackhawk’s observers who are entrenched on the edge of the cliff, Lucien is not too close, without the deformed mask himself, it’s easy It was discovered by Prince Dracula that it was the magician who had been paying attention to in the mausoleum of the Sphinx. At that time, he thought it was difficult to doubt:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein disappeared in ancient times In the southern desert of the Star Empire, there was a sneaky, high-ranking mage who had the Archer’s creation of the item, and then the Master appeared again near the Observer Castle. It is irrelevant unless it is said. Dracula’s head has been stiffened and corrupted as the years passed, and it will be believed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the pocket watch, Lucien reconfirmed the time, and then applied himself to martial arts and other spells, drinking the remaining little potions, will be "pale The justice is firmly in the hands, with its legendary level of evil power, sensing the movement around the castle, and opening the monocle, if there is an accident, Natasha will contact himself urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, if Lucien does not seek the help of Natasha, he can do it himself, but the choice of distance and time will be quite troublesome. Far away, your own control spells don't work, and the time to reach the observer's castle is difficult to grasp. Maybe before the night plateau jumps back, Dracula excludes the possible surname of the Rhine, and once again blocked at the door. When the distance is near, Dracula has very little time to go back and forth. Maybe he has not yet ran to the front of the observer castle, he has already made a round trip and caught the impersonator with a deformed mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five minutes, it should be enough for Viscount Hades to report to Prince Dracula, who is a descendant of Dracula."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien puts the pocket watch back into the pocket of the magic robe and counts the time. One of the reasons for choosing Viscount Hades is because he is a favorite descendant of Prince Dracula. Otherwise, there are several middle-level vampires in several provinces near the northern fortress. Why choose him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the safety of Natasha, since she has promised not to take risks, Lucien chose to believe that she would not be reckless, impulsive, never Doubt, this is from mutual trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and when Lucien’s heart is silent to three-five-six-seconds, “Pale Justice” suddenly trembles, like Encountered the most terrible enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through it, Lucien sensed the faint but unusually evil powers around the observer’s edge of the cliff, as if it were extreme Pure darkness and death power are intertwined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold your breath, no movement, Lucien counts down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten, Nine, Eight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observants who seem to be always shrouded in darkness The old castle is like a faint layer of ashes, which produces a slightly more illusory illusion. Lucien has a dark and hard-to-see light that casts an "acceleration" on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...5, 4, 3..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night wind blows, except for The dark creatures who often come here slammed slightly, and there was no other sound. Lucien took out a bottle of medicine to speed up the flight and poured it on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two, one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the number is one, Lucien will fear all All the worries, all the cockroaches are left behind, and the shells fly to the observer castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind whistling, oncoming, the dark forest under the feet quickly regressed, and many magical creatures turned their attention to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you can only move forward and seize the opportunity to win safety! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking through the wind barrier, Lucien fell to the door of the observer's castle before all the creatures reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clehamie." The long-awaited mantra blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness around, suddenly there were countless red-eyed fist-sized bats that rushed out and rushed toward Lucien at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who can semi-authenticize the things in the dream, these are like real bats, with strong alert, exploration and offensive capabilities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flight, densely packed vampire bats each emit an invisible sound that merges into dizzying fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, distinguished guests." Alchemy life Mikhalik made a sound of Qianlong, the door was not open and did not seem to see the castle The dangerous scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien clings to pale justice, and with its resistance to violent, enchanting, helpless and other negative states, resists as if from the depths of the soul The dizziness rushed to the door that opened a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength and speed are greatly improved with the aid of pharmacy, magic, and goods, and there is a great gap with balance, reaction, etc., so Lucien After stumbling and rolling into the gate, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a vampire bat fiercely and fiercely fell over the edge of the gate, when Mikhalik was dull The sound of the sound: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy attack, open the first layer of defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black things jumped on the walls and gates of the castle. Any blood-sucking bats that came into contact with them turned into dust. The blood-sucking bats were not afraid of death, and they continued to attack one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien climbed up, put back the pale justice, lifted the magic of blessing power, kept the final balance, and then recited the mantra, Flying quickly to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, even if someone knows that someone has broken into the observer castle through projection, there is no doubt about the choice of Prince Dracula, it must be the arrival of the Rhine. The province of Tilan, because it is not the Rhine that enters the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is more important, who is the purpose, he will not be confused, and there will be no hesitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After restoring the balance of Lucien, the saffron sea that quickly retreats through the tide, the strange worm that made the last time alert and fear Turning a blind eye to the scarlet tree, there is only the door to the hall in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet smell of paralysis is neutralized by a healthy belt, and the strange sight is not worthy of the heart of Lucian, and there is no eye-catching point. It extends to the door of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clehamie." After reading the mantra again, Lucien felt that this short time of ten seconds was almost a long life. The strength of the muscles is being squeezed clean, and the fatigue that is difficult to restrain is rising from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien took out the "Congas Forest" medicine to drink and eliminate the fatigue, the alchemy life Mikhalik once again used its dull echoing voice: "Welcome, distinguished guests, in addition to controlling the core, the energy room and the bottom of the treasure house, the rest, as long as there is an opening spell, you can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien did not relax, read the secret spell of Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your requirements, despite the instructions, respected guests." Mikhalik’s voice became thick and he answered with affirmative I open the control core and the bottom of the treasure house. I follow your orders just like the instructions of the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, all the castle defenses are stimulated The alert level is adjusted to the highest level. Except for Mr. Rhein, no one is allowed to come in.” Lucien speaks quickly and orders, and in this case, time is life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? Mikhalik screamed humanly and seemed to know that he had met dangerous things, and then he replied solemnly: "Follow your orders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observer The black lightning that jumped outside the fort all disappeared, blending into a layer of transparent reticle that appeared in a complex structure, like the expansion of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All sorts of weird creatures in the magic garden disappeared, the scarlet demon tree disappeared, and everything behind Lucien was immersed in darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, Mikhalik said: "All the defensive tactics are fired, the alert level is 'legendary', what else is there?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
