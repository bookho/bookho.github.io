			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sound of "the name of the gods glory" by Lucien, Douglas, Fernando, etc. inspired special items and saw the five groups of "God" surname". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the iron-black cockroach placed vertically, the cover fell to the ground, igniting a faint ashes, revealing the "master" inside. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such changes, the spells of Douglas, Fernando and others are ready to go, and Lucien has a silver-white pocket watch in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome man in a black and white robes standing in a black shovel, tall, with his eyes closed, arms clasped in the chest, showing the cross . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a little angry on his body, as if he has been dead for many years, but the skin is shiny and delicate, can not see the slightest decay, the biggest feature on the face is that His image became a hazy hook nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien heard from the soul connection at the same time Douglas and Fernando are slightly shocked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very common name for the Shahran Empire, which can be put together with the quaint crosses around it. Lucien only thinks of one person:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Pope of the Northern Church, St. Ivan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "culprit" of the North-South division, St. Ivan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Ivan named after the capital of the Shahran Empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of electricity, just a short moment, "Ivan" in the black shovel suddenly opened his eyes, it is bluer than the sea, sad than sadness A pair of eyes that are more transparent than gems, deep as if to absorb all the light around, resulting in a brief darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Ivan, St. Ivan Cathedral, a secret Prayer indoors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a standard Shahran-style big nose of the northern church. The current Pope Bilkovsky is praying before the cross. Suddenly, his eyes are sharp. Opened, the pale yellow eyes quickly swelled in the blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who broke into the 'Holy Spirit Room'?" His voice was low and repressed, and then the body gradually became light, illusory, as if in the air, Solidified there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And St. Alexis, St. Felix, St. Uliel, St. Gono Cathedral, four Saints Cardinals simultaneously opened Closed eyes in prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the god before the "Ivan" 光 light ball Flying into his body, letting him open the clear wings of one god after another, more holy than angels, purer than the sun, more embarrassing than the stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nose is getting taller and taller, like the most common style of Shahran, and the eyelids are gradually yellowish, and behind the head, The glory of the surname of God seems to have turned into a single face. There are also some of the strangers I have seen, and there are many strangers that Lucien does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, in the flat squat, the three covers were smashed by the body inside, and three men in white robes flew out. Floating in the air, blending with the light ball of the surname of the god above, opened the wings of the surname of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one is still not moving, as if something has flew into the light ball of the surname of God above it, let it grow longer and become An angel of light with a golden eyelid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart suddenly ran a record: “...Ivan, Alexei, Nikon, Uliel, Gono, Felix VI The cardinal attacked Wilfried's half-face magic tower, killing him after a fierce battle, and destroying the fate he hid... Among them, Nikon was killed by Wilfrid..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...On that day, the gods looked at the holy city with eyes, Ivan, Alexei, Ullil, Felix, four saints and Souter, Allers, Sirius, and other seven Holy Spirit priests. Standing out under the golden light, accused Gregory of being the incarnation of the Lord of Hell..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole room was dazzling, The sacred glare is in stark contrast to the monotonous black and white gray of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Advanced time stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storage enchantment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Body of Death!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Legendary Transformation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"傀儡魔偶偶!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge gaze!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-way spell The sound is ringing at the same time. Although it is still unclear what happened, it is obviously a bad development. It must be stopped immediately, and there must be no hesitation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "St. Ivan" held his arms open as if embracing the world and embracing the dirty world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless tiny angels appearing around him, sang with praises of the Holy Grail, similar to the "Hallelujah" that Lucien had heard in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monotonous black and white gray above broke open a avenue, the projection of the paradise mountain emerges, and the light follows the line connecting the light ball of the surname of God. In the body of Ivan, the wings of the god's surname are more dazzling, more brilliant, and the breath rises rapidly. It surpasses Fernando and surpasses Douglas, reaching a level close to the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this change, time and space fluctuate, the secret room is shrouded in sacred colors, and the legendary magic of Douglas, Lucien and others has been eliminated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sacred people will all be judged." Ai Lan’s eyes were faintly yellow, and Ivan stepped forward, solemnly pronounced, and the holy light rushed. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienton felt that the surrounding time and space changed, it seems to leave the black and white gray dead spirit world, into the vast starry sky, in the distance is a sly Stars, next to Fernando, Erica and others can no longer be sensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Douglas’s solemn voice sounded: “gravitational cage”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of nothingness, the vast starry sky disappeared, Lucien found that he had been moved to a position, not knowing which palace he was in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Speaker of the House stopped 'St. Ivan'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky above a hall of the Temple of the Dead, one item, one wall, can not withstand the horrible pressure, twisted and shattered, and in the darkness of black In the past, the clear wings of the surname of the gods seem to have not been greatly affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you have found the path of the gods through general relativity, I am very curious." "Santa Ivan" with a smile, the right hand five fingers open, light With a light press, the gravitational cage is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heaven of the Stars!" Douglas has a strange starlike instrument in his hand, a little bit of light shining, so that the surrounding really falls into the innocent starry sky, infinite, dark deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his exclusive legendary item, which can directly create the "Star Heaven" lock, enhance itself and suppress the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, his mental power is slightly mobile: "You are not Ivan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because St. Ivan split the church, it gave the opportunity of the rise of the magical parliament, so Douglas, Fernando and St. Ivan had a lot of dealings. After a short identification, they soon found out that it was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inheritance of power?" Douglas seems to have grasped what he knows. "No wonder there are only four cockroaches open, because the rest is Gono, and he has been thoroughly after returning to the holy city of Reims for a few years. Fallen, you can only replace him by some things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the proportion of saints in the north church will be so high!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Ivan smiled, didn’t swear again, played a close to the power of the gods, and would suppress Douglas with the help of the lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the storm enchantment, black hurricanes plunder, countless giants Under the lightning, the rich dead air and the solidified black and white gray are crushed, alternating with hot and cold, destroying everything nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alixie, Ullil." Fernando’s red eyes seem to have a stormy world, and anyone who sees him will suffer unimaginable Horror, and his storm enchantment surrounded two white robe men and the Lich King who did not know when to prepare for a sneak attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these two white robe saints, Fernando is no stranger, they are two of the three great saints who follow the church of St. Ivan, and the other is obviously It is Felix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-eyed "Ulier" shook his head and said nothing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Light of Judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wings of the surname of the glory of the gods are closed, and a light that seems to have fallen from the highest point of the paradise mountain is judged, and everything in the world is judged. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he and "Arikie" even if there is a fusion of the gods and the light ball, it is only close to the legendary peak, both together, plus the assistance of the Lich King. However, it was a tie with Fernando, and it was in a fierce battle. It was even in a disadvantage. The aftermath destroyed the nearby palaces and provoked a horrible roar in the Temple of the Dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another palace, the soul of the dead, Vicente, met with Felix, and he was slightly suppressed by the light of the surname of the god’s surname, and Ai Lika's Rainbow Dragon and the "Gonno" ancestors of the gods of the light of the light of the angels of the light in the sky, sometimes in the lake of evil spirits, the battle is very intense, although the level is one level, but She has the help of legendary items, and the other side has nothing to do, and she can support it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is 'St. Ivan', it is only in ' Under the oracle, there is a kind of power close to the gods, and it is impossible to kill the lord of the speaker. However, the man who can face the pope and the body and retreat at all is temporarily suppressed for a while, waiting for the magic effect. It’s hard to say that it’s gone,” Lu Xi’an is not worried about Douglas. The same is true for the teacher Fernando. “The teacher is the legendary peak of the real thing, even if he is besieged by another four, there is a safe escape.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the surname of the light ball is too great, so that Lucien can judge the strength of the enemy at a glance, the angel of light is the legendary third-order, and the other three saints are close Legendary peaks, all sieges, and at most the teacher will suppress, although waiting for the four legendary third-order Necromancer to help, the teacher will definitely be in danger, but the teacher is not a fool, will watch the other side of the reinforcements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you reach the peak of the legend, you can leave if you want to go, unless there is a stalk of the same level." Lucien sighed slightly. It is dangerous to yourself, Elika, Klaus, etc., even if the great arcane master of Vicente is dead here, it is hard to say when he will be resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling all the previous thoughts, Lucien probably knows who is inside: "The five saints... It seems that the coffin cover is not open." The one is Gono. He died long ago, so he used other methods to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, under the influence of the sacred technique of "Santa Ivan", everyone was separated and moved, and it was once again quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sinister cover of "Gonno" was opened, and a white robe man with pale red eyes slowly climbed out of him. Rotten muscles fall off and grow new flesh and skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
