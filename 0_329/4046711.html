			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital of the Principality of Calais, Cox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Spirit Garden" connected to the magic tower of the "Sorcerer's House" headquarters, the light is always in the midst of change, everywhere, different from time to time. Like a human heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cursed Eye" Atlante walks on a semi-bright, half-dark garden path with his cane, his eyes closed, his face looks like a half The light of the face is uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a question to ask Douglas why they want to hide as a god-like method, or does it pretend that nothing happened?" His heart repeatedly asked This problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the authority to grasp the human heart, what kind of misfortunes Vicken has, what is the plan, he can probably speculate that the "poison" is not on the surface, but on becoming a class In God's method, he really does not need to do anything by himself, because as long as he chooses this path, sooner or later, because of different ideas, contradictions of the road, and the magical parliament gradually drift away, relying on him who has mastered the enormous resources of faith, After all, the idea of ​​the Magic Council is to use the Arcane to break the religious blind faith and shake the foundation of the church's beliefs. It is absolutely impossible to actively support a strong sect. The new sects who have become a few state religions are the limits of tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a bright and poisonous one, and it’s still irresistible. It’s been a long time since I lived, and I have buried many legends and created the truth. Old monsters..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, from the exchanges of the previous top-level panel meetings, Atlante guessed Douglas, Fernando and Lucien? The thoughts of Evans, the reason why they concealed the specific details of the gods, mainly because the road is too big, it is easy to become an uncontrollable emotional devil, and will encourage everyone to secretly develop religion, so it is difficult to establish The atmosphere of the Arcane research is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas is open-minded, with a high vision, and a kind of god-like light brought by general relativity. How can it not hide the secret of this kind of god, Fernando's temper though It’s hot and eager, but it’s always avidly treating the arcane, chasing the truth of the world, and he’s not expected to see such a big god-like method...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Eye of the Curse" speculates on their thoughts from the surnames and psychological states of the two legendary peaks. It is almost close to reality. "As for Lucien Evans, it is already the second-order legend before the age of 30. Put forward a theory of subversion of surnames, and create the basis of the two pillars of the current arcane system - relativity and new alchemy, it is only a matter of time to become the peak of the legend, and the general theory of relativity will also give him the hope of becoming a god, further development After the new alchemy should be OK, so the young people with bright futures are absolutely disdainful of this kind of god-like road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning, a few weeks, the road Sean relies on this time Harvest among the risks, especially the "monster" Viken let him realize the state transition and "The Secret of Immortality" thinking brought about by the success of the legendary second-order promotion, more than the previous record year of Brooke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Sean didn’t want to report it, but because the information he got from exploring the dead world was amazing, Erica and Vicente were rewarded. The choice of two legendary magic or legendary rituals, Douglas, Fernando is five, Lucian is ten, so he is telling Helen when he is ready to pick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlant analyzed the mentality and thoughts of Douglas and others and sighed softly: "Even if I ask questions, they should be similar answers, but instead They will let them doubt the news from where I know, and suspect that I have got a way from Wicken to become a god-like god..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly ridiculed: "Greed is really the source of all sin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not greed, if it is not the heart of the mind-like road in his mind, he will certainly confess to Douglas and others, and suggest They made a statement to the highest commenting team, set up the authority, and now...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Transformation Master" Erica came to visit and asked to draw differentiation Philip Bell's business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are a little troublesome, Wicken seems to have made concessions and frankness, even if the Philippine Bell Cardinal has been shaken, the cardinal has refused. I am wooing." Atlante honestly said his own guess, he is the authority in the field of illusion and psychology, and this task is naturally done by him to organize personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of old monster is killing, so he can look after many years, not for the benefits of short time." Atlante said, thinking about his own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, this road has shown too many hidden dangers, so he did not dare to try it rashly, secretly saying: "First secretly do some experiments to reserve information. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 17th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower," In the Genetics Laboratory, Felipe, a black long trench coat, carries a cup of hot water and looks at the "Arcane" journal in front of him. His face is as full of illness as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien-Levsky space, it seems that there is no big debate in the micro-domain, two new alchemy systems are different aspects of a model." Felipe took a sip of water and read the paper with some difficulty. Because the study of the soul involves electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic fields, special elements, and ** is composed of various elemental materials, so he is equally concerned with the study of the microscopic field. I am also working hard in the next. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after matrix mechanics, the microscopic domain becomes very unfriendly, and the arcane mechanics with a slightly worse mathematical foundation often have headaches, wave dynamics. The proposal has slightly solved this problem, but Lu Xi's argument has made people continue to hate the "mathematical devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe has always been known for his expertise in mathematics in the Necromancer, which is why he is so fast, but recently In two years, his pride was deeply attacked. A paper in the journal Nature, mathematical descriptions of general relativity, matrix mechanics, and Lucien-Levsky space are all so difficult and terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But mathematical and microscopic research cannot be abandoned, or else even the cell and genetic aspects will be caught up by the latecomers." Felipe looked gloomy In a sentence, he once thought that with a good magnifying magic, the relationship between cells and heredity will be clearly displayed in front of themselves. It can be a long time passed, and progress is poor. I found the chromosome and guessed it. It’s related to heredity, but everything is here, and there is no result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him clearly feel that there is no mathematical support, no support for the achievements of the arcane field, such as elements and electromagnetics, and he is almost incapable of making progress. Either wait for someone else to complete the previous things, or learn by yourself, master and develop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, his cell-based research didn’t give him much feedback, but the soul and undead biosynthesis were two areas he didn’t care about to make him magic. The strength has improved by one step and reached the eighth ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the controversy in the micro-domain has dissipated with the approval of Lucien's wave dynamics, and Felipe temporarily puts down his concern and looks at Heather. Wei and Helen's research results in crystals, some of their previous experiments gave him a little inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a cursory look at the paper, he stood up and nodded to the high-level magicians of his lab, and then opened his own small lab. The door, I saw a large plant planted inside, saw the mouse with red eyes, and saw the moths in the bin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No way to make a breakthrough based on magnifying magic, Felipe can only find new ideas from the phenomenon of plant, animal, magical creatures, summarizing the law, and Supplemented by the Necromancer magic, whether the transformation of some experimental subjects is inherited, how to inherit and control, but unfortunately, the progress is not big, because this is a direction that takes a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱吱吱, the experimental mouse screamed wildly, and the colorful magic moths slammed the bins, only the plants were quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling this noisy, Felipe pinched his forehead and resisted the urge to destroy them, whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do I have to deal with them in my life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a farmer, butcher! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Atomic Universe", Natasha finished the daily tempering After returning home, I saw Lucien sitting in the study room in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
