			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without quotes, he will come out himself." In the mind connection, Natasha has a smile, apparently in the fun of the road. Things are done." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El still wears an olive corolla, wearing a white robe, but more and more ethereal and quiet, there is a faint glow on the skin, and there seems to be a hole in the pupil. The projection of the seven-story Heaven Mountain is extraordinarily sacred and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding a black sword like a black ink, rushing toward the two, above the blade, from time to time, stinking [***] black Liquid, but sucked back by mysterious power, completed a cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has been seeking to absorb the death, the surname of the gods in the moon, and may not be able to stand up after sensing the mysterious fragments of the dead world. The pseudo-god is very susceptible to the influence of the priesthood and the attraction of the surname of the god, so that he loses his reason." Although Lucien said this, his heart was still slightly strange, and Elco almost died in his own hands, even the ability to resist. None, after he saw the two of them, why did they rush forward with such confidence? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lucien took the time to give Natasha the magic of "British brute force" and "bear bear". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When El entered the scope of the spell, Natasha raised his sword and greeted him, and Lucien directly applied "high-level magic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you’re just using Elton, you’ll see that your body’s light is shining, like a fireworks bloom, and the two spells that are pre-added also highlight the rupture. At this time, Natasha had already flown to him, and “Pale Justice” pressed down and brought up an illusory gap that could separate any matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the haste, El Hengjian blocked the "pale justice", but was beaten back by Natasha, lost balance, was stormed Attack suppression is difficult to separate the spirit of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien rushed to inspire the spell model, his eyes flashed green, and El only felt that the magic resistance decayed rapidly, so he was in his eyes. The seven-story heavenly mountain projection shines brightly, as if it is to be materialized, and the strength of El, bathed in this holy light, is greatly increased, stimulating changes in the surrounding environment, the darkness subsides, the light emerges, and the sacred and solemn atmosphere comes out. , suppress all unclean, evil forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The semi-illusive will field? El promoted the gold knight?" Lucien and Natasha simultaneously made a voice in the soul connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang, after three consecutive runs, Natasha was forced to step back in the air, and El Holy looked purely at Lucien: "I Commanding you, dying..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two-character mantra has not been finished yet, and El’s brush disappeared in place, and Lucien lifted his right hand. Hold a scepter with a huge gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no signs of the sacred will of the surrounding world, and the darkness renews everything, and the coldness blows the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power has increased a bit, but it has not reached the standard of the real golden knight, I can fight." Natasha quickly told the final message to Lucy. Yep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded: "It should be within a certain range, He can borrow the power of the Divine, no wonder He dares to come out. However, can be outside the Divine Borrowing the power of the gods, it shows that El's strength is close to the golden knight. It seems that he has integrated the gods of the sun god, the earth god, and so on, and has gained a lot of "faith power."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side, Lucien arranged a magic trap in the position corresponding to the maze. At this time, a figure flew again in the Death Valley, with six wings behind it, surrounded by thunder and lightning. Rescue "great El God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of thunder and lightning, the current lightning angel?" When the distance between the two sides was closer, Lucien saw the bald man and recognized his Identity, at this time, the lightning angel expression was dignified, the wing flapped, trying to stop Lucine’s action, but after brushing it, he also disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at Lucien’s continuous use of the nine-ring maze, which was quite sighing: “Magic is magical, don’t worry about being attacked. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly arrange the magic trap, Lucien did not wait for the odd maze to end by itself, lifted the sun scepter, and released El. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a black tentacle emerged in the field, stretching into the sky and entangled with El. The magic of this element seems to come from nature, not so much suppressed by the sacred will of El, but rather Can immunize numerous injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Natasha also rushed to entangle the dead, who was restricted in his actions, and did not give him any chance to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s black eyes became blurred, and El suddenly slugged in place, then Lucien stepped forward and the wisdom in El’s eyes The light is also weakened to the extreme, like the eyes of the beast, without the ability to think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing the Ring of Congras, the cognitive world has been upgraded to a more substantial level, and Lucien’s spellcasting time has been reduced again, using the magic below six rings. At the time, it is closer to wearing the effect of the fake Dawei robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really good to deal with this pseudo-god that is easily influenced by the surname of God by using sluggishness and mentally retarded surgery." Lucien flew to be controlled by Natasha. In front of El, his eyes became deep and unclear. Looking at it carefully, it seems that there is still a little bit of starlight running in the mysterious trajectory, and people can't help but lose their sense of indifference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El throat screams, his eyes slowly return to the clear, but the expression becomes very respectful, whispered: "Accept your instructions." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Lucien moaned slightly and then made an "instruction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels like a fake god is very good to deal with, and you can change the eight-level knight who can use the external force to create a semi-illusive will field. Your sluggishness and mental retardation are Will be hard to resist the past." Natasha is half-confident and half-speaking is funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and replied: "The false gods are terrible in some respects, but the weaknesses are equally prominent, such as the weakening of resistance. Curse, I dare not use the magic of the dead spirit, the earth, sleep, etc. to deal with El. His priesthood is these aspects, it is likely to weaken most of the effects, even direct immunization, and if it is in the valley of death, The magic of the illusion system will also be suppressed by the divine power, and it is difficult to get it easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donton, Lucien quietly connected Natasha with a spiritual connection Road: "But it's so easy to get it, it's not a little dangerous, it's still a bit strange, especially we pre-estimated that El is weird, and the result is not strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Is it strange that it is caused by the miracle of the paradise mountain? Maybe your astrology is directly biased to the 'master', so there is no result." Natasha said her opinion, but she did not express Affirmative, in this respect, Sean is an expert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien decided to try again, take out the crystal ball, cast astrology, this time, after the fate of the star in the crystal ball, the fate of El The main star is clearly revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you really predict to go to the god of truth?" Lucien shook his head in confusion, looking at his place under his control. There is no such thing as El, and Natasha said, "Maybe you are saying that, but El is in the domain of God and the fate of the God of truth. What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not overlapping, just let the prophecy deviate." Natasha replied resolutely, if she acknowledged the overlap, wouldn't she admit that El is the God of truth? Or is it his avatar? This is a ruthless mocking and blow to her faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien converged and wondered: "Let's try again in the gods, kill Francis by the way, and then arrange a plan to deal with the demigod lich." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the domain of El, the prisoner has been killed, Francis went to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So alert, no wonder you can be in spy, while having a name in the night watchman ranking and purification sequence." Natasha grinds the teeth, then with Lucien Together, I found a hidden place, carrying astrology with El. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, his destiny star has become blurred, is it really the influence of the gods?" Lucien frowned at the light spot inside the crystal ball, then Start thinking about how to deal with the demigod lich. "The miraculous miracle of the paradise mountain is very repressive. The strength of the demon lich will definitely weaken here, and El will amplitude to the peak of the golden knight. So, If you want to deal with the demigod lich, the battlefield is best chosen here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
