			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice Cracking Sword", a four-level medium enchanted sword, raising the balance of the surname, adding ice and acid damage, just to buy this weapon, Jacob Cloth spent nearly 10,000 Quinta Lejia's original three-level magic sword, but in his last battle, he did not even have the opportunity to pull out this sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the waist of Jacob, pick up this long sword, Lucian shakes his head and looks at the straight blue and green ray of the sword, and then it Demon Soul Armor, a three-strike "discipline" ring that is released three times a day, worth 40 gold taels of carry-on gold coins and gems together into the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob does not know how many aristocrats, businessmen, and how many smuggling businesses have been smuggled in secret, but they have saved enough of these equipment, but now it is simple and cheap. Lucien, but Lucien is not ready to use them, because there is a possibility that the nobles in the Shahran Empire will know Jacob’s personal belongings, which will bring no trouble, so he decided to give it to Leo and let him Replace these pieces of equipment with the low-end items on Warren's body, and then secretly buy magical swords that are useful to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the unicorn necklace that can immunize with charm, suggestive techniques, etc., and is not easily seen by others, Lucien is wearing a scorpion talisman. Putting the two together creates a conflict and is temporarily prepared to let Leo wear it, lest he buy and sell goods and be controlled when he arranges things in the Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting the wealth, Lucien’s mood became comfortable, and the crystal ball with the right hand and half hand was put back into the jacket pocket – the star system is a lot of magic even Constructing a spell model in the soul, due to the illusory fate of the fate, still need to use the morning light crystal ball to help the cast. For example, the "Maskillin Star" is the most typical example, and other factions have similar special circumstances. It is not necessary to construct a spell model in the soul that there is absolutely no need for a casting medium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic wave flickered, and Lucien’s body quickly disappeared and quietly left Warren’s villa estate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The basement of a common residential building, one of Leo’s secret hiding places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, the news that Jacob was killed has caused a sensation in the city, causing chaos. Many lords have to divide his estate, land, Gemstone veins, smuggling warehouses and channels are confrontational. It is said that they have been arguing over the meeting of the lords, and even the ancient inherited magicians who have lived nearby are coming, hoping to share this eye-popping wealth by joining the Eastern Conference of the Exiles. Even in places where there are no outsiders, Leo has earnestly referred to Lucien’s current pseudonym. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was slightly surprised: "Is Jacob's property so much? But why is there so little magical material on him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo is like a true housekeeper and replied meticulously: "Because of the benefits outside the manor, he has to dedicate most of it to the nine city owners, and his own blood purification has also improved. Requires materials such as moonstone and werewolf blood, plus the luxury of living, the money that can be used to buy magical items is less than one tenth of his total income."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the higher the level of magic items, the rarer it is. There are only a few high-level items in the East, and they are all taken by the nine city owners. The magic items of the fourth and fifth levels are also uncommon. It is even more difficult for him to meet himself. After Jacob became a fourth-grade ten years ago, it took several years to complete the four-level sword, armor and long-range attacking intermediate magic ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently jaws, this is plus One of the benefits of the Magic Council and the will of the element is that there will not be enough wealth to buy the magic equipment that suits you, whether it is the exchange area of ​​the Magic Council or the half-face warehouse of the elemental will. Picking the eye, every time I love it, I can’t make up my mind, I just don’t think I have enough money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reaction of the nine city owners?" Lucien most wants to know about this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo, who made up the old man, shook his head: "Mr. Peter, the meeting of the lord is currently unknown to outsiders, but the owner of the Taran Tavern secretly told me that the owner The man only came to ask Warren about the conflict with the people in the pub. After that, there was no similar investigation, and there were no wanted orders, killing missions, etc. Several lords competing for the Jacobian heritage claimed to be Jacob. Bu and Warren offended the big man of the Magic Council and were found to be easy to kill, so they competed for the inheritance in full compliance with the rules of the East."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Peter, you will lose at least 20% in a hurry, and the 4th and 5th magic swords are not common. If you want to buy them in a short time, it is basically impossible to suit your characteristics and will not satisfy you. "Leo did not ask questions in a vague way." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pushed the single-lens and smiled: "It doesn't matter, anyway, this magical sword is only used temporarily. The only requirement is that there is no power, agility, The use of will and other aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that when walking through the Shahran Empire, magic can be used as little as possible without using it, so it is extremely powerful. The magic sword that can effectively improve the strength of your knight is especially important. As for the problem of inconsistency, you don't need to consider it. Anyway, after returning to Allinge, you will sell it as an arcane point, then buy magic materials, potions and appropriate Magic items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your wishes." After getting confirmed by Lucien, Leo no longer said anything, politely left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A few days later, Leo took a scabbard inlaid with a ruby, and returned with a sword that was as slick as a vigilant sword. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Peter, the magic sword you want, the fourth-order high-order, worth 23,000 Jintal. Selling the ice crack sword, the demon The soul, armor and disciplinary ring are only a small part of the gold, gems, etc., worth about one hundred and sixty Jintales." Leo will be handed to the scabbard of the sword to Lucien, and The images and other evidence of the sale and purchase process were also taken out to show that they did not profit from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out the long sword, the glittering metallic luster has a faint blue icy taste, the shape is completely different from the scabbard, simple and generous, just the hand guard The finest craftsmanship is full of complex patterns, like the flamboyant silver flowers blooming in layers of frost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Natasha’s method, Lucien left her own breath on the sword very easily, and got the dwarf craftsman to stay when casting. The next paragraph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frost, a four-level high-level magic sword, cast with a special green ice in the depths of the North, and the person hit by it will be affected by the cold. The injury will become sluggish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody doesn't like the enemy getting slower and slower when fighting with themselves! - Aduran? Copper hammer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest value of this sword is the slow effect, the rest is not outstanding, and for Jacob, because it has a dark aura, so this The long sword does not make much sense. It is better to choose a more ice-splitting sword that balances the surname and the strong acid corrosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien waved a few times and felt the effect of the ordinary four-level knight attack, then took back the long sword and wore the "vigilance" on the left and right sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the evidence submitted by Leo, Lucien looked at it without looking at it and directly destroyed: "I believe in Leo your character, and as a The magician, I can also assess the value of this long sword. Is there any other change outside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo is slightly excited about Lucien’s trust: Mr. Peter, the news from various sources such as Mr. Valentin and the owner of Taran Tavern confirmed that at the meeting of the lords, the nine city owners had acquiesced the lords to obtain their own Jacob heritage and expressed their agreement with the Magic Council. Warren’s revenge is not mentioned first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The nine city owners in the East’s exile have a certain communication and connection with the Magic Council. "Lean is thoughtfully concealed, after all, to maintain the neutrality of the East and to profit from it, even if they do not favor the Magic Council, and often even use the balance of the Shahran Empire, secretly deal with the opportunity Not less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien stood up and said: "Leo, there is no moon tonight, we are just starting."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the dark night, the blazing flame fortress is like a dragon squatting at the mountain pass. The road to the future is completely blocked. The rest is a black coniferous forest with various fierce monsters. Snowy cliffs that are difficult to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to reach out to the five fingers of the air, Lucien was flying with Leo quietly, as if into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the intelligence tips, Lu Xien easily passed away after circumventing several patrol routes with the help of clouds and the magical airship patrol route. The fortress was flown to the distant vicinity of the Shahran Empire town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
