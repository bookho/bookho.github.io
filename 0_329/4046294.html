			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown mask is always an exaggerated smile, but his voice is very low: "No, Lucien?? Evans is frank, There is no circumstance about why it is private to let Grace pay the bills to Granny. It seems that this thing is really not weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, is it true? Really has nothing to do with him? He is the only person we can investigate with the 'Professor'..." Fighting pastor Juliana turned her head in frustration, and her right hand unconsciously pinched a black hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor is a code name, and it seems that it has not been used any more. If you break the clue, you can only rely on spies inside the Magic Council to steal its files. However, spies who can access such confidential files are so wasteful in similar aspects that the cardinal group will never agree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Night Watch Red Dragon" Minsk is as loud as a roaring roar: "Impossible! Lucien Evans is absolutely related to the professor! The professor first appeared It was because there were magic apprentices who asked him for information; the professor designed us to encounter the silver horns and killed the traitors. Lucien Evans’s uncles and aunts were rescued. Lucian left these years. The professor never appeared..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana, "The Demon Hunter" Lund shook his head slightly, and many of these reasons were very reluctant or even Putting it together, for example, it is obvious that the professor did not appear after the traitor was killed. It was almost half a year since Lu Xi’an left Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason for Minsk is really hard to accuse Lucien Evans, but don't forget the news submitted by the Djibouti parish, purifying the two famous characters in the sequence - Felipe and Professor once appeared in the original Wilfried collar." The clown looked at the three companions with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "death feast", the church has not known, and did not investigate this aspect, but Felipe forcibly broke through the rampage of the storm strait blockade The move angered the church and noticed that he led a group of ancient inheritors of the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This necromancer, except for those deep in the dark mountains, most of them are scattered in the mainland, only the original Wilfrid collar This ingrained and long-lived area of ​​the Necromancer could gather so many numbers, so the church strengthened the secret investigation and intensive search for the original Wilfried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Felipe had already arranged for the Necromancer apprentices before he left, he could face such a strong pursuit in the tightly controlled area of ​​the church, and finally have one The magic apprentice revealed a flaw and was caught by the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although breaking through the strange magic contract signed by Felipe, the referee’s reviewers failed to know what happened at the death feast, but they still tortured The simplest fact is that there were two “well-known” characters, “recoverers” and “professors” who participated in the death feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the purification sequence, the Djibouti Principal submitted this information to the holy city of Reims, and then the cardinal responsible for the matter spent a lot of resources, according to the normal process It was conveyed to various parishes and various referees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Others may not know, but we have been paying attention to Lucien Evans, how could not have found that he was also in the Djibouti Principality at that time, in the original Erfried collar! It coincides with the time of the professor’s participation in the death feast!” The clown’s voice was high and very angry. “But when we submitted this to the heads of the Vaolirit referee, they were without evidence. You don't need to pay attention to the refusal, even the investigation is not willing to do it! Don't you know why this is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think the magistrate is more reasonable, the biggest It may be that the Royal Highness of the Princess arranges to teach the road to protect the road to Sean Evans. "The Demon Hunter" Lund is not as excited as the clown, and still defends as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee of each parish has three responsible persons: the agent, the examiner, the magistrate, but many powerful parishes often have one in order to control the subordinates’ courts. The cardinal is solely responsible for it, and is the real giant of the referee, such as Amorton in the Diocese of Vaolirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minsk growled: "plus a series of coincidences in front? If Lucien Evans has no close relationship with the professor, I am willing to fall. Hell! Lund, I tell you, the reason is that the head of the referee and the cardinal are not willing to fall out with Natasha! She is a devout believer, the future Grand Duke of Vaolirit, the church balancing the power of the nobility Important chess pieces, how could it be because a middle-level magician, a devil who killed the 'pointer' night watchman, went to investigate her beloved lover and caused a crack between her and the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lund’s facial muscles twitched and screamed, and I was very sad and frustrated: “I don’t know...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;referring to this matter, Juliana is three more than Everyone is sentimental and touched. Her voice is like a crying: "But the fall of a five-level bishop and the night watchman captain in El Salvador, but no referee responsible for the thorough investigation, only exchanged for the holy city of Lance to Nata Shake’s three years of imprisonment. Is his devout Lord’s Dark Guardian only worth three years of time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I chose to be a night watchman because I believe in the Holy Scriptures, 'Under the throne of the Lord, the devout lambs are all equal', but now it seems that some people are more equal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sighed deeply and said in a near-rebellious tone: "I believe this is not the true intention of the Lord, but someone has distorted the church..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Only the truth will last forever." Hearing this, the clown, Minsk, and Lund both painted the cross on the chest. , But the clowns and Minsk is closer to being classical style cross in front of the sacred calendar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, what should we do? From what aspect of investigating Lucien Evans?" After the prayer, Lund calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has now succeeded El Salvador as the captain of the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown’s very exaggerated face turned to look at Lund: "Of course it is a direct test of him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Direct hands?" Lund did not expect the clown to be so crazy, "This will provoke Natasha, she is now a Knight of the Sky, is a famous "sword of ruling"! Followed by 'Deep Blue Tide' Camille, it is only two of them that will be able to destroy the entire night watchman of the Vaurit Principality! And the referee will certainly not protect us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a Knight of the Sky, Natasha also has her own honorary title "Sword of Judgment". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown is very exaggerated and laughs with his own mask: "Can she and Camille be able to watch Lucien every day? Once the five-level knight like me does not With scrutiny, many things will become very simple. Don't forget that I became the nickname before the 'clown': the 'killing' in the dark mountains!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Lund, you can rest assured that there are no days of knights in the security guards of the Principality of the Principality, and there are not many great knights. It is even more general to be able to send a secret to protect Lucien. It is impossible to find my sneak. If Lucien is only investigating the quasi-knight strength, then I can easily control anyone, control him, and get the information I want. If he shows magical power, this is not the most direct and most Is there strong evidence? Are you still worried about Natasha’s revenge?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the clown’s funny, crazy smile, Lund can’t object, just click Nodded and agreed to his approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Late night after a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint figure almost blends into the darkness in the villa garden of Sir John in the aristocratic area, quietly avoiding several guards in the dark. Department staff, sneaked into the interior of the villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark corridor, a maid walked out with a candlestick, and the dim light shone more and more quietly and repressed - she slept I remembered that I had forgotten a piece of jewelry in the corner of the living room when I was cleaning in the middle of the night, so I quickly got up and went looking for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and dark, the evening winds of Hunchun are so cool, scared the maid to be a bit wary. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, let the maid fight a cold war, and became more and more afraid, because she seemed to see a faint, fuzzy black shadow in the wind passing by, not as fast as human beings, but like Ghosts and ghosts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no abnormality in the maid after the teeth hit the top and bottom, so they went back to their room while painting the cross, and decided to go to the living room after dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden door of the Lucian residence did not sound, and did not stir up the breeze, and the funny mask of the clown emerged in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing a colorful clown costume, wearing plain black gloves on his hands, lifting his hands and playing the piano. Creeping ten fingers, seems to be looking for the mysterious connection between everyone and the world, with space, and with others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
