			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "Exploration Tour", the picture on the "Live Screen" did not return to the "studio" as before, but was accompanied by a familiar audience. The melody shows a clean blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the sky, there is a fusiform metal thing floating in it, which has smooth lines and bright colors, giving a strong visual impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this program?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you let us experience flying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience who have just experienced the "savanna" and "undersea" are confusedly communicating with their companions, and are excited to guess the possible outcomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Creative design, the latest energy conversion array, unparalleled speed, life-saving protection like a copper wall..." The magnetic male voice passionately introduced This aircraft, while the aircraft in the sky constantly changes his posture with his words, showing his unique magic effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds stunned by the audience, the world of the aircraft is far away from them, and the man described it so perfectly that it seems that even the little noble family can’t afford it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "airborne" aircraft is getting lower and lower, there is a city below, the city is gradually clear, you can see the square full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds on the square are like a black torrent, and the half-space of the aircraft is wide and empty, in stark contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aircraft parked over the square, overlooking the ant-like crowd below, which allowed the audience who shared the vision of the aircraft to feel a sense of high above But think that they actually belong to those who are overlooked in the square, and their mood has become very subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the vision and feeling of the "big aristocrat"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is fixed in this scene, the magnetic male roars like a roar: "'Layton' magic change three, the most worthy aircraft in 829, hurry Pick up the phone at hand and call XXXX to book..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the "Mystery Voice" and various radio programs, they realized that it was an advertisement. Even the ads are so attractive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the feeling of the "experience" aircraft just now, think of the price that it is definitely expensive, many young people are both depressed and inferior, and they ignite the raging Ambition, one day, I will also succeed, embark on the peak of life, and drive the plane to overlook everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fists were subconsciously clenched. They suddenly thought of the big aristocrats who now have all kinds of aircraft. They thought of all kinds of aristocratic privileges all the time, and their inner feelings changed. It’s complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The following is the 'sports moment', we will send you a flight between the Allinge School of Magic and the Peafor County Owl School of Magic In this competition, you can use the means of flying, flying, magic broom, magic pet and other routines to help the flight. The referee designated by the Arcane Review Committee will score according to the evasive action of the airborne flight, and then weighted with the time used. On average, get the final result..." This time, I exchanged another host to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the gradual popularization of newspapers and radio stations, local audiences are no strangers to the long-running flight competitions of magic schools, but their understanding is all based on words and sounds. There is no intuitive impression, so now it is interesting to see, from time to time whispering to the gentleman who is not afraid to smash is not fair enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a new and wonderful program, time flies very fast, when the "nightingale" announces the end of this "satellite live broadcast", on the square The crowd did not want to leave for a long time, gazing gazing at the "live screen", looking forward to the miracle, hope that the new phase will begin immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you broadcast live once a week..." Whether it’s Langman’s father, mother, or other ordinary people around, he’s really sorry for it. A strong desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman likes the "Exploration Journey" and "History" programs. He sighs and sighs: "Mr. Nightingale is not saying Now, the current program is not enough to support the live broadcast every day. When it is slowly accumulated, it will meet us every night..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It faithfully recorded the "war" that lasted for hundreds of thousands of years, starting with the question "Whether light and spiritual power is a wave or a particle", starting from the germination of disputes in the ancient magical empire, reducing the arcane The teachers' pursuit of "truth" restored a classic and magical experiment, restoring the sorrow of a generation of Arcanists in front of this problem...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The big man who broke his head, the strong one who cognized the world and broke away from the historical stage, will have a tragic color on the persistence of "truth" and the development of arcane. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this documentary really makes Langman and other ordinary people realize the magic of the Arcane after the magic coat is removed, from the arcane master who explores the essence of the world. Admire inwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what happened after the first “wave war”, how did it become like this... Lang Man恍惚 thought forward, This is the grandeur of the school's "A Brief History of Magic and Arcane", which makes him want to see the second and third episodes of this documentary...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Langman’s father suddenly laughed and said: “Harrington finally bought a magic radio to listen to the 'Mystery Voice’ at home, but missed 'satellite TV'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughs very happily, because of Langman’s talent in mathematics, he dare not spend money, hoping to make money for Lang Man’s future study – even if his magic talent belongs to ordinary people. As long as there is achievement in the arcane, there will always be a certain strength improvement. He does not expect Langman to be promoted to a high-ranking magician and become a real big man. He only hopes that he can break through the formal mage stage and earn a certain society. status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, seeing neighbors have bought magic radios, no longer come to the square, he always feels a little sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Really sorry for them, such a wonderful show, new and wonderful enjoyment..." The audience next to the repeating the words of "Night", then Slightly sighed, "This 'live screen' is certainly many times more expensive than the magic radio. It is not really a nobleman who can't afford it. Maybe for a long time, we have to continue to gather the square..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if Heaven Mountain is not, it will be more wonderful than it is now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I play it once a day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Joel, Alisa, and Grand Duke Oa. When they left, they had a strong interest in "satellite TV" and they were completely immersed in watching. Especially Joel, after experiencing the "exploration journey", had the impulse to create songs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Appreciating the social changes brought about by the Arcane has become my hobby of music..." Natasha also has a strong interest in some of the "satellite TV" programs. Then she went to the "closed room" and began a period of meditation - this is the way that Lucien proposed to exercise, since the three years of loneliness at the bottom of the monastery can help her truly grasp the blood of the fusion, To enhance the will, it means that this is no less than a method of combat tempering. It is better to try every three days of meditation every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked into the study, picked up the mainstream journals such as "Arcane" on the desk, and slowly flipped through the last part he had not finished reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien took the "Janus Arcane Overview" from the side, and through this excerpt journal, a brief and concise understanding of the various magical factions of the past month. Research progress - in addition to the mainstream journals of the first and second echelons such as "Arcane", "Magic", "Nature", "Element" and "Star", the rest of the journals are filled with a lot of results but no meaning to Lucien. The careful reading of the papers is a waste of time, so he looks at the content through the excerpted journals. If he finds the papers of interest, he will look for the original journals to read them carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The January January Arcane Overview is a special form. On each page, the left side is the name, abstract and keywords of the article, and the right is the Arcane Review Committee. The validation comments help readers understand the approximate content and value of the paper as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Thoughts on the gauge field?" Lucien suddenly saw an interesting topic, so he read the abstract and reviewed the comments. Find out the corresponding "Buriana Journal" and read it all over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
