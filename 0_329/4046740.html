			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a crack in the translucent space, the moment the sun is shining on the ground is the unprepared elf of Malfurion, Lanhill, etc. Tree fairy, humans can not help but close their eyes, resisting the brilliance of countless times of blindness, but even so, they still have a feeling of the ocean of light in front of them, boundless, dazzling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is getting normal, Lan Hill and Celine open their eyes and look at the bloody plain, only to see a beautiful mushroom cloud in the center. When it rises, the demonic powerhouses at the core have already vanished. The edge of the giant pit is a glass-like scene that melts again and solidifies again. They reflect the blood of the sun and create a clear and radiant look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The far demon army can't find a good body, the broken limbs and broken brains are all over the place, or blood red or green or other The color of the blood is poured on the gravel and the soil, giving them a bloody strange beauty, like a red-red eater blooming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon army farther away has been sparsely pulled, some have become corpses, some have licking their eyes, they are rolling on the ground in pain, and the scales on them are broken everywhere. A variety of talent defense capabilities can no longer see a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is a plain, because of the many white stones that are very easy to break, the tide-like demon army is like a break under the eternal blaze The torrent of the source, dried up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the different types of demons who have not been harmed at the farthest point, because Lucien’s attack is aimed at the demon of the demon, such as the demon, so lose the command. They seem to have been scared of courage and rushed away. After only a few tens of seconds, on the bloody plain, in addition to the painful mourning, there is no sound, and there is no half of the demon who can stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more bizarre is that the air that was originally filled with various curses was like being cleaned up after the eruption of "Eternal Blaze" and became very clean. There is no longer a faint distortion of the scene, which erodes the feeling of the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the bloody plains are briefly sublimated from the chaotic, bloody, vicious and rancid endless abyss into a refreshing and tidy heavenly kingdom—provided that the blood and bodies of the land are ignored. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the lord of the abyss, the "blood scorpion king" did not show up and made any expression, and did not stop the devil's squatting, abnormal silence The mammoth attack quickly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translucent space cracks seem to tremble under the horrible energy storm, so that the power of seals has been reduced a lot, but unfortunately, no one demon dares to come Seize the opportunity and be re-blessed by the druids of Malfurion and others who have been returned to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown person in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason was worried and discussing with Fred, and suddenly heard the devil’s shouting voice, and frowned: "The demons started attacking again." It’s really a smothering desire to kill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The abyss says it’s 666, but in fact, no one knows, The devil inside is even more difficult. The loss of daily attack is nothing for the demon kings." Since this time, Fred has had a deep understanding of the number of demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is a creature that is essentially chaotic and unable to control his own killing and bloodthirsty desires, but they also abide by the instinct to avoid disadvantages, if not high The demon, the demon duke, and the demon king are powerfully suppressing the intimidation. They will certainly not attack the attack. Especially under the attack of the legendary druid, each attack will suffer a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason opened his mouth and just sighed when this life would end, and the unbelievable roar broke out in the ear, shocking both knights Short-term deafness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They subconsciously looked into the gaps in the abyss outside the town, and suddenly they were stabbed in the light of the brightest to the extreme, as if the sun in the sky broke out directly in front of them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two violently closed their eyes, the tears could not stop falling, and the feet felt the earth being shaken, the waves undulating, and standing unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this extraordinary ability?" Mason stabilized his body and blurted out, but his horrified voice was drowned in the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How terrible is the original power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, under the strong resilience of the Knights, Mason’s eyes returned to normal, and the feeling of rolling in the depths of the earth disappeared. not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange azure scale on his eyes, the pupils contracted and erected, and once again looked in the direction of the abyss gap, saw that the head was extremely The huge mushroom cloud, combined with the experience of the past, Mason has a shock from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is the beauty of destruction..." Half of the cigar that Ferred had in his hand had fallen to the ground, looking at the distance with horror and appreciation. That picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason has come back to God: "Mushroom Cloud... Eternal Blazing Buddha? Is the reinforcement of the Magic Council coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When the Magic Council and the Southern Church fought, "Eternal Chivalry" was cast in the whole city of Rentat, and it was powerful and frightening, not to be ignored by the top leaders of the country - just in the promotion legend In the hands of Hathaway's Hathaway, relying on the preparation of materials in advance, it has the power of being close to the gods. If Douglas is fully committed, I am afraid that it is equivalent to Ivan who has performed the gods, or is equivalent to a kind of god strike, and, According to the Magic Council privately revealed to the nobility of the country, there is no upper limit to the power of this magic...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Knight of the Sky, Mason and Fred are undoubtedly the Kingdom of Colette. The top level is deeply impressed by the mushroom cloud of intelligence description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if it is the Arcane Emperor, or is the storm dominated, the elemental dominator is coming?" Fred said, guessing, relieved. "We can see Leaving here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the reinforcements are coming, the elves are not afraid of being attacked by the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mason also showed an expression of anxiety relief, looking around the town, whispered: "I don't want to stay here for a second, or else , will be out of control ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the two once again looked at the bloody plains behind the cracks, all kinds of emotions: "horrible magic... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The demon army has retreated, we can discuss and check well There was a gap in the abyss." Lucien put his hands in the pockets of the black double-breasted long dress, and Natasha, who floated next to the volley, secretly sneered after witnessing the silent reaction of Lan Hill and Celine. In the mind connection: "Dry beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quite likes the feeling of relying on strength to shock everything, seeing the "eternal blaze" destroy When the demon army was in full swing, he was willing to join the battle group and chase the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion regained his gaze and said: "When the gap in the abyss changes, it is me who guards here. Everything is normal, the town of unknown. There are no legendary ranks coming in... In the early hours of the morning, I suddenly felt the chaos of the abyss appearing, and the time and space changed. When I came back, I saw the ten meters long and two meters wide. The gap is stretched to the left and right by 30 meters, and the height is close to four meters, which is close to the door of a natural time and space..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to talk about the actual situation of the gap At that time, I wanted to tell Lucien and Atlante every detail so that they could use arcane knowledge and special magic to determine the cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Atlante did not say anything after listening to it. They began to check the gap with magic such as "The Mirror of Destiny". After a long time, they opened their mouths. Ask: "Elder Malfurion, the abyss breath and the change of time and space occur at the same time, or are there before, who is in front, who is behind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion carefully recalled: "It should happen at the same time, but after a second or two, the fluctuations of time and space become clear and obvious, suppressing the abyss, and when I return to God, the abyss is gradually rich. All other changes have been obscured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, Atlante asked several key questions in succession, Malfurion and later guarded here. Both Lodell and Celine replied one by one. They described the agreement and no one should lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, is there any conclusion?" Malfurion asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
