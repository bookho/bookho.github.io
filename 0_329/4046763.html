			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus puts down his right hand covering his eyes, solemnly: "The Lord heard our prayers and specially gave us the magic to let us spread." His glory preaches His Word.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is the best compliment to us!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke loudly, and the white radiance of the whole body rolled into golden sunshine, waved in all directions, drowning the dwarves such as Harold and Mirna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold suddenly felt that his strength was rising again, his emotions became excited, he was full of fighting desires, and he was not afraid of despair, pain, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the feeling of being a real warrior! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the five-level magical "war", and is the limit that Augustus can reach now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Augustus’s inner worries and dangers have disappeared completely. The great steam god is not able to give magic, just because he is more Like the mystery of steam and machinery, he smiled and solemnly said: "I listened to the teachings of the Lord and understood that the steam and machinery contain the deepest and greatest secrets of the whole world. If we can master them, we can have transcendence. The power is like the eternal blazing weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord tells us that magic is only a temporary part of our journey to protect ourselves. Weapons are not the real thing to survive and proclaim His Word. After this stage, we will naturally let go of the magic, put our whole body into steam and machinery, discover their mysteries, and use their own Try to get the real power that you can master, so that we can build Atlantis on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold and Mirna lead The rest of the core dwarfs tremble: "Wei The god of steam, you love us, just as you have the supreme authority. Under your blessing, rebuild a brilliant steam civilization!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustus hesitated a little, but thought of the sacred and vast atmosphere and the magical god after surgery, or a solemn statement: "You pray in front of the sacred objects, the Lord will give you the faith of the devout gods ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecstasy once again hit the hearts of the dwarves such as Harold and Mirna. After witnessing the scene just now, they thought that this was the main special The elders who descended from the elders, and those who had a little shake in their hearts, waited for a longer period of time to regain the magic with actual actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the great god of steam is not prepared to give himself to others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the embodiment of virtue, teaching us the truth of forgiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold When the dwarf again covers his eyes with his right hand, he prays in a sincere manner. He feels that his spirit is empty, his faith is more pious, and tears of joy are faint in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Harold came to the silver "nuclear bomb" sacred object, silently reading the contents of "Mechanical Revelation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy voices around disappeared, and the dwarves such as Mirna looked at Harold with great enthusiasm and expectation, will the Lord drop God's grace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the silver sacred object once again shot a bright and brilliant light. It shines on Harold, as if to put him in a holy coat, making him much like the "angel" of the Truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really gave the magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milna and other dwarves were excited and excited, and they witnessed the miracles and witnessed the Lord’s care for the dwarves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold’s breath grew rapidly and stopped slowly at the level of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, the great elder Augustus sighed quietly, according to the standard of the field of magic, he is a five-level bishop, and Harold is three Level, he is still the leader of the dark night dwarf family, still the archbishop of the steam church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the rest of the dwarves did not complain, because the most devout believers who were given to the gods, those who became the leaders by relying on "pious" - after becoming the leader, even if not so pious, they must behave It is very pious, otherwise how to control the subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the ceremony, Archbishop Augustus was re-arranged before the sacred object, and was very serious: "The magic and the goal of building Atlantis on our ground are Contradictions, therefore, the Lord does not let us show off this matter, otherwise it is easy to get lost in power. He warns us to keep this secret and only quietly show it in front of devout believers, who told the outsider, or is not necessary In the case, when the outsider's face is displayed, he will be regained power and become a sinner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not really understand the great steam Why did God want to drop such a god, but he realized the miracle, and after he got the god, he did not dare to question it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold, Mirna, Quikins and other dwarves are even more afraid to have doubts, all covering their eyes with their right hand:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" will follow your teachings, you are the master of life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Silver white "Holy" lingering white brilliance gradually fades, if there is a Master or legendary level of existence here, you can see a vast universe in the light, inside the stars are emitting different colors bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atomic universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien floats on a relatively solid silicon planet, in front of an altar with complex magical patterns, and a bald dwarf on the altar Statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statue is made up of hand-polished metal parts, with a layer of ice-cold mysterious luster, and the head is engraved with a dark cyan secret pattern, like Exudes the electromagnetic waves of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred and solemn white light continually gathers from the void, wrapped around this statue, they continue to fly in and out, gradually blending together to form a vast and transcendental Unique feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light spots that have not yet merged are like a little angel flying, if you listen carefully, you can hear different prayers, praises and songs. Sound, they create an ethereal holiness around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the gods flows out of the statue, feeds back into the altar, and draws magical power from the altar. In such a situation, magic and magic are unprecedentedly harmonious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the heart of faith contradicts the cognitive world, otherwise we can also use the magical technique without relying on the aid of the goods." Lucien is still floating around. The four men, Douglas, Fernando, Hathaway, and Natasha, are Douglas who sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magician can also build a cognitive world based on part of the belief, just like Arthur, when the cognitive world collapses and breaks, it’s not bursting his head. Instead, it is swallowed up by the Holy Light, but this does not mean that he can perform the magic, unless he completely transforms the cognitive world and solidifies into the heart of faith. The same reason, except for the superficial gods, there is no clergyman. Construct a cognitive world and cast magic with a heart of faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly: "The two are not the same foundation, one is built on the nature and mystery of the world, with its own cognition Lord, one is gradually obtained by the ideology and the god of faith, and will lose part of the self. This experiment, I hope to explore the details of the secret of the false god, unlike before, only the general guess, There is no real progress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the path of the gods improved by Tanos, Viken, etc., and the "Dark Dragon God" that was previously captured The original method of the pseudo-god is very different, more able to reflect the essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Existence is the truth, whether we want to admit it or not, do not want to go this way, the existence of 'spiritual' itself indicates some aspect of the essence of the world So, we can't escape, we must face it. The truly determined arcane master will not deviate from his beliefs by studying the secret of the gods. Lucien, you can carry out research in this area, which is very valuable." Douglas has this Very broad mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I hope that the Speaker, the teacher, and Hathaway, you can keep me secret, in the case that we have concealed the god-like method before us. I am worried that this matter will cause other members of the highest panel to doubt my intentions, and then release some research results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
