			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merze Black Forest is near a hidden cave in the dark mountains, the silver robes high priest Ilya stands on a half-high soil platform, watching the sparse below The fallen priest, the anger is like a volcanic eruption, causing one deep and one crack in the soil under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure power, without any extraordinary blessing power, the silver robes high priest Ilya is now acting as a high-ranking dark knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can tell me what happened?!" Ilya snarled loudly, but the language used was not in lingua franca and ancient languages, but Words filled with darkness, evil, and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fewer than ten "white horns" who can escape from the chasing of the church and the Knights. A five-level knight "night killer" Dragan, a fifth-level priest, a fourth-level priest, and three priests, an ordinary dark knight, is the "silver-white horn" remaining in the Vaurit duchy All the strengths, the loss is more than 90%! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can such a situation not allow the hard work for many years to develop the "Silver Point" to Ilya, which can rival the truth and teach a parish reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his roar, the priests, priests, and knights all lowered their heads deeply, and dared not face the anger of the high priest, and Ilya’s anger gave way. He ignited a black flame with a strong sulphur smell, letting his silver hood float back like a wind, revealing his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a monster with two curved horns, blood red eyes, full of evil and ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mad venting for a while, Ilya finally recovered her senses, put the hood on again, and then asked: "Who can tell me why Camille, Amorton and Gossett and Natasha will come over so quickly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silent, no one answered, no one knows why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iliah’s red eyes looked at the seven believers and asked again: “Who can tell me why the damn magician’s 'Professor’ will go to the seal Escape?" This is the information from Dragan eating a night watchman's brain, and they hurriedly escaped. They didn't know what was going on in the underground cell. They thought that Jensen was sneaked in the rush. The night watchman got rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence, or silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia almost lost his mind, and finally suppressed the impulse of roaring: "Who can tell me, the damn 'professor' intelligence?!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time someone finally answered, Dramangk held the fear of the powerful momentum of Ilya: "The respected high priest, according to a certain magic of cooperation The message provided by the teacher, 'Professor' is probably a special commissioner from the headquarters of the Magic Council, to investigate the previous things. In fact, in the first two days, we got the information, 'Professor' agreed with a magic apprentice to meet nearby Exploring the ruins, but because their position is too far away, the news about the ruins is not accurate, so we did not stop, I did not expect that the magic apprentice brought the church watchman."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing stopped, you didn't stop it?!" Ilya couldn't wait to tear the draman in front of her into the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragan understands that he has said the wrong thing, he can only bow his head and dare not answer, but his heart retorts: "If you are so far apart, you must To stop, the entire Melzer Black Forest is a range that needs to be stopped and is more easily exposed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east entrance of Larnaca Canyon is separated from the Ranger’s hut A full distance of more than ten minutes, and "professor" the "Emden" ruins they are about to explore is in the direction of the Marsall River! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia growled and said coldly: "I suspect that the 'Professor' deliberately brought the night watcher over, on the one hand can get rid of the inside (female + dry On the one hand, the night watchman can be seriously damaged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, the high priest, you didn't tell us, this time, the magic parliament is and Are we on the same side? Why is 'Professor' doing this?” asked the fifth-level priest in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned around: "I will pray to the great silver master, master the eternal silence of the true God, and see what kind of revelation He will give."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the cultists collapsed and began to pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, and there is a strong black shadow in the priest’s gown of Ilya, covering the front, the darkest, the deepest In the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a horrible pressure in the darkness, and the evil voice that could not be described in words seemed to sound in everyone's heart, but no one could understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the shadow disappeared, and Ilya stood up and raised her right hand: "The great silver master revealed me that things have indeed changed, but in his eternal Under the constant grace of grace, the change will be delayed, and we will have plenty of time to complete this event and continue to build his territorial God for the true God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "May you walk on the ground, as if you are walking in your country." Other cults are full of joy and authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia continued: "The great silver master gave me a prophecy about today's things," a falling star opened the chaos The throne of destiny lost its master, and the unbelievers who walked in the light and darkness made their debut on the gorgeous stage.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does the true God's prophecy reveal? "Dragan did not understand this poetic prophecy at all." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilia shook his head: "Aalto was defiled by the evil spirits, and the existence of the evil evil devil, Thrall, made the prophecy very vague."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Ilya, who was inspired by the "Lord of Silver", understands that even without Thrad, the prophecy of the prophecy will remain vague and ambiguous, because all prophecies are like this, even if there is " The same is true of the prophecy made by the legendary magician of the Prophet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destiny and time are always the most ugly. Every prophet is like a blind person facing a mountain and can only touch a part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lusien slept very deeply until he was close to eight o'clock, only to wake up in the crisp bird sounds coming from the forest near the manor. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it was the end of the dance last night, so no one was bothered to disturb Lucien, and no one urged Lucien to have breakfast and let Lucien cross the road. The first time I came to bed in a soft velvet quilt, I got up for half an hour and had a simple grooming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the clothes, Lucien opened the door and walked to the main house hall. Just down the stairs, a maid greeted him: "Ivan Mr. Si, what kind of breakfast do you need?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, milk, bread, cheese and sausage.” Lucien wanted to violently “sport” last night. A high-calorie breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid smiled very sweetly and politely: "Mr. Evans, are you going to the table for breakfast, or are you going to the room?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the restaurant and accidentally discovered that the Rhine was cutting the steak with a knife and fork, and then put the bloody piece of meat into the mouth gracefully, it looks It’s like having lunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sensed Lucian’s gaze, looked up and wiped his mouth with a napkin and smiled: “Luxien, Felice’s The fried veal is very good. It uses the meat of the burdock and the ribs. It is tender and juicy. Don't you try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien told the maid: " End to the table, give me a fried veal, cooked in seven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting opposite the Rhine, Lucien smiled and said: A delicious breakfast in the morning will bring a good day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also complements the physical energy consumed by 'sports'." Smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a nobleman next to him smiled twice, but he obviously understood the wrong meaning: "Evans, Yvette is only a beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the knife and fork and cut the steak: "Albe, I twisted my foot last night and didn't open the door." When Felice was dancing, To Lucien, he pointed to the noble youth Albert, who is also a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
