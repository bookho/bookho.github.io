			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Prophet" Bergner also distributed a "Mathematical Basis" in front of him. He had already gotten before the special issue of Nature. The news, from Levsky, asked for a rubbed manuscript. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has to be said that although this book of Evans did not create the insights and mathematical results of the surname, he ingeniously proposed some new concepts and redefine some concepts. It has closely integrated many scattered research results in the current mathematical field, forming a complete system with clear branches, strict structure and solid foundation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...and his deep elucidation of the system completely dispels the fog surrounding the mathematical field, so that the entire Mathematical Palace is finally bathed in the bright sunshine, showing brilliant golden..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when I read this book for the first time, Begner has sent out a similar sentiment, but every time he reads it, he can’t help but admire it, since calculus creation After the era when the concept was defined, this was the first time someone had made such a big contribution to the field of mathematics through a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The era of calculus has passed, this is the modern mathematics..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begner seems to have seen a new branch of the field formed in the mathematical palace, and their source and concept come from this "mathematical basis"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, the most important thing is two aspects, one is the high tower geometry axiomatization system completed by Lucien, which makes him similar. The mathematics is full of endless enthusiasm, as if everything in the world can be axiomized, and a system of strict self-consistency and flawlessness can be formed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is Lucian’s in-depth study of topology, group, and set theory, which has given him some inspiration. They seem to be more than simple, Reading and abstract mathematical results are also directly applicable to solving many of the problems in current arcane research, such as crystallography, such as the forefront of the microcosm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is definitely the most surpassing book in the field of mathematics in the past 100 years. It will definitely be put into the hall of mathematics by future arcane masters. Worship with "The Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy", but unfortunately, if there are no ten questions in the final appendix..." "Prophet" Bergner's face with a faint bitter smile, in front of "Mathematical Basis" The place to spread is the "difficulties in current mathematical research." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his legendary magician who is good at mathematics, he has no resistance to this part of the problem. After roughly turning over the front part, he is lost in thought. And calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the "mathematical basis" to today, he has been thinking for a whole week, but there has been no progress, even a topic, he failed Solving, this makes him quite frustrated in the field of mathematics. Especially some of the problems seem simple, it seems easy to prove that in the actual process, it is full of unimaginable difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these are nothing, the last barber paradox is a horrible problem that makes people scream, which directly leads to Berger’s rare stunned one. hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the determinism was completely negated, there was no more painful and embarrassing thing for the towers than the problem, and cheered and celebrated in mathematics. When the palace was finally completed, its foundation suddenly collapsed, as if the collection theory was applied and the concept of the past was recognized, it would negate the mathematical theory itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bei Genna sighed for a long time. As soon as he saw the barber's public opinion, he almost couldn't help destroying the Mathematical Basis with magic, killing every hairdresser. It seems that endless disasters will come. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and saw the words of Lucien written after this paradox: "A similar paradox is very frustrating, but it only shows There are still many rigorous places in our research, which shows that we have a certain degree of deviation in the understanding of mathematics in the past. Therefore, we should not be desperate and confused, but should study in depth and conduct a deeper study of set theory. There is only one solution to the problem, and that is to continue to study mathematics itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Evans’s arcane attitude is to support him to do so. The basis of multiple results.” Bergner praised one sentence, turned back to the set theory part, rethought and studied, and the paradox of collection could no doubt be solved only from set theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I am your old friend 'nightingale', followed by 'Arcane News' time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General school is still on holiday, Langman only Learn about the latest developments in Arcane by programs such as "The Voice of Mystery" and "World Real Channel." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Ivans completed the masterpiece of Mathematical Basis, which solved the current problems in the field of mathematics and cleared the obstacles to progress. The most striking of them is not the previous content, but the ten problems that are raised later, which make the Arcans full of research interest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...have to say that the difficulty of living Evans is indeed extraordinary. So far, no arcane master has claimed that he has found a way of thinking. Even the Speaker of the House of Lords and Mr. Brooke have admitted in public. It’s not that easy to solve these seemingly simple problems...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...It seems that no matter who solved the ten The problem will be to get rich Arcane points and become a recognized mathematical authority. These problems are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Boy Langman can hear hard to live After Evans’s question, he opened his eyes and dared to believe that he was eager to try. Impulse, if you can solve the problem that Evans can't solve...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These puzzles selected by Lucien each have their own surnames, but they all seem superficial The simple one, so Langman can understand it on his own weak foundation, try to take out the paper and pencil check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Your Evans tells us that although these issues have nothing to do with actual arcane research, solving them will not bring about a substantial surname. But the research on them will certainly promote the development of mathematics, and the development of mathematics will support the study of arcane... The same applies to other mathematical fields. In this pure world, You should blindly pursue the application of the surname..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Langman soon can't go on, can hear this, but the heart is burning with a blazing flame, burning His cheeks are red: "The field of mathematics is so important? And it seems that there is no need for magical support... Although my mental talent is poor, it does not mean that I have no mathematical talent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I must be an Arcanist! Experts who are good at mathematics!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the common characteristics of the surname, most of the arcane masters are curious after seeing the Mathematical Basis Looking forward to try to solve the problems raised by Lucien, Evans you can not solve, does not mean we can not find ideas! If you can really solve one of them, you will gain unimaginable glory and benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, during this time, Elstin and Nordaniel walking in Allinge often saw an arcane master with a stunned expression and walking. They seem to be immersed in their own world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as time goes on, there are fewer and fewer such arcans, more are the faces that have been hit, the "mathematical basis" in their hands Often marked with different symbols, there are devils, there are representatives of nightmares, there is no way out of the labyrinth, in short, even if these ten questions are hung up in the long-term display of the mission area, the wave of them can not be avoided The end is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, the tower towers have the most complicated mood, on the one hand, they really like to solve similar problems, on the other hand, they are deeply attacked by public opinion, and feel again By the time I decided to talk about the shackles, confusion, and despair of the passive shake, and I was not sure that the surname was not sufficiently important to confirm the experiment, the public opinion presented the contradiction completely in a simple and clear way, so that they had to face up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Havin is still alive, after seeing this paradox, it is estimated that the same path will be chosen..." Samantha looked at the window with some melancholy . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel’s mouth twitched: “You also burned the Mathematical Basis to him... Is this a nightmare for him to die... To know that this book is recognized as "Devil's Book", for the arcane masters who are not good at mathematics, the knowledge of numbers, collections, groups, etc. in the previous part is more terrible than the devil, so that they can not wait to tear the book off, but For our arcane masters, the latter problems and paradoxes are beyond the horror of the abyss will..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what, mathematics will continue We will definitely find a solution..." Samantha encouraged herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
