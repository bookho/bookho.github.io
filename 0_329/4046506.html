			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's him, Lucien Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength has temporarily dropped to seven Level, but Ramiro recognizes his identity from Lucien's unreserved magical fluctuations and breath, and thus understands his current dangerous situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first opportunity is lost, the strength is reduced, and after 12 seconds, it may be lowered again, so that you are in front of Lucien Evans, who has countless magic items. There is almost no chance of winning, and his magic wand with sun jewels that can be used for imprisonment has not been used yet. He has to delay himself and is attacked by the magic of soul-like curse and destiny. Interfering with fate, it really fell completely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, Ramiro is more willing to run into the 9th Ring Master. If the other party does not know the details, it may be very difficult to escape with a strange ability. Gao, and handed over, and witnessed his self-destructive Lu Xien? Evans is sure to guess his own card, will inevitably take corresponding precautions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He has cast two spells in a row, even if one is a four-ring, an item comes with it, and should fall into a short buffering dizziness state."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't think of the opportunity to defeat the victory, his triggering has not been used, the longer he drags, the more dangerous I am."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must make a decision, hesitating will only kill yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many ideas come to mind, in a short moment, relying on the will Ramiro, who is rich in advanced and dangerous experience, forcibly converged despair and frustration, and judged the current situation. The muddy mud that came from all sides of the beach suddenly expanded and blew without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it has been blew for two or three months in a row, even if the last injury has not been completely restored, even if it is in a state of weakness for a long time, Even affecting the possibility of becoming an epic knight in the future, Ramiro can not care so much. At this time, not guilty about himself, not acting decisively, is the connivance of the enemy, and will always be in a state of weakness and weakness, and will never be promoted. Epic knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, the earth-shattering explosion turned all the gold, silver, and gems near Ramiro into powder, and the horrible shock wave brought countless pieces to extreme Amazing momentum and speed rushed toward Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe you don't hide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't believe that you keep going under A spell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ramiro’s will seems to be in the explosion. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the cognitive world (meditation environment) has been transformed into a "wave-particle two-image idea," closer to reality, Lucien is faster than the same level of meditation. Two to three times, the buffer after the magic is applied is also shorter than the normal six-ring magician, and the most important thing is that the first two magics, one is the four rings, one is the immortal throne robe comes with, caused Casting buffers are very short-lived for high-level magicians and can be recovered in about a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Ramiro’s self-destruction also wants to rely on the power of terror to force Lucien to defend himself when he has just passed the caster’s buffer and is in a hurry. A spell like it can be triggered directly, so that he can evade the short but extremely dangerous soul transfer time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible waves are used in every direction except behind, with the momentum of destroying everything. In this case, no magician does not Consider yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien Biramiro is expected to recover earlier, almost stunned from the stun when the explosion just happened, facing this level of explosion, he Subconsciously, the "energy absorption field" is used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, before the hands-on, I repeatedly told my words to come to my mind in a timely manner:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If you can't kill and imprison Ramiro, he will definitely promote my identity everywhere. At that time, it is a trivial matter to be able to observe and record the gods up and down. It is a big trouble for the cardinal to stare at it." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't let him out of my control, death or imprisonment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crystal of snow and ice, from the left chest of Lucien, with a deep silence in the ice and snow, into the inflated air. At the same time, the horrible explosion power hit Lucien. He suddenly disappeared into the place, and then flashed into the entrance of the secret passage. A layer of mask that protects against energy damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the spell triggers a little late, Lucien is a sullen face with a bleeding in his mouth. If it is not immortal, the defense of the throne is OK, and avoids it. The most ferocious moment of the explosion, I am afraid that it will be as severely hurt as it was forced into space, instead of the normal injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the time when the explosion was calming down, Lucien took out a tube of "Song of Water" and his face slowly recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps because of the freezing effect of "silent hail", the horrible explosion has not been looted for a long time, and it has completely subsided in just a few seconds. The gold powder and silver gemstones of the earth, many artifacts and materials are also destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?" Lucien carefully examined it carefully and suddenly found an ice-like crystal in the center of the explosion, which seemed to freeze the secret black. Shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of the clerk took the crystal over, and Lucien confirmed that it was because the silent hail was not completely melted, and the shadow inside the crystal was A group of muddy flesh and blood, through this flesh and blood, faintly can see a pale Ramiro face, expression is sluggish, like freezing ice sculptures for thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His body and soul are very special. Before freezing the soul with a silent hail, it is even the soul with the flesh to melt and dissolve, leaving no trace. Lu Xien slightly sighed, and continued to display the magic seal of this ice crystal, and then took out the morning crystal ball, through the connection between the body and the "divided body", looking for the resurrection card left by Ramiro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Ramiro’s self-destruction and seeing him live in front of him, Lucien even if he is an ordinary person can think of his inevitable resurrection. Combined with the bizarre division and self-explosive ability of the flesh, it is initially possible to guess that he completed the process by splitting the flesh, and it is not clear that directly killing the remaining soul of Ramiro will kill him and make him unable to rise again. Lucien chose to find the "things" he left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of resurrection without the aid of the corresponding magic rituals must have spatial distance or time constraints." Lucien began with a semi-professional perspective. "Magic Scouting", this kind of resurrection is definitely not like the Lich's talisman, and Felipe's improved life hiding technique, even if it is far away, the time of losing consciousness is long, and it can pass the pre-remaining after death. Life and props are resurrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if Ramiro’s bloody abilities are so bad, the resurrection of the meat is hidden in the holy city of Reims, and Lucien can only Recognized, after leaving the underworld to dominate the Divine, he immediately left the place, relying on the specials of the fate and secrets to avoid the legendary powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crystal ball, the two lights are slowly and brightly bright, and there is a connection in the middle if there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, just outside the gods? He delayed coming in and it was the card that laid the resurrection!" Lucien whispered to himself, then put away the ice crystals. Take time to find materials and artifacts that have not been destroyed in the treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, from the connection, because he has frozen the soul of Ramiro, there is no sign of resurrection, so that may be very good for himself. Experimental material! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien collects while secretly saying: "The fine gold, the secret silver has some remnants, the soul stone and the blood grain steel are much more than I expected, the number of stars in the sky Rare but enough, there are some fine gold, secret silver and copper in my storage bag, and now I have ice iron." In addition, the blood of the river that can repair the healthy belt also found a flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the whole palace swayed violently, and a hint of blackness rushed in, dispelling everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So big shock? What did Francis do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning of the meditation Completely disintegrated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation became critical, Lucian quickly ran the star of destiny, using prophetic spells to find a way out, between stars, crystal The light of the ball points to the secret passage that Asin enters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
