			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Weekly recommendation has been ranked to fourteen, continue to seek referrals, Sanjiang tickets also ask, huh, huh, can not fall too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, according to the proposal, the words of psychological activities in the future, do not need double quotes, use [], so as not to be confused with the dialogue, let everyone look Not comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Lucien seems to have come out of the abyss and replies with a sigh: "Piedru, have you seen Ms. Silvia? The three ladies together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in retrospect, Lucien found that she could not remember the two women, only the woman wearing a black cap In the end, I looked back at the smiles, and the horrible, dangerous blue pupils, which were deeply imprinted in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powerful strength, Lucien only seen in various fantasy novels on the earth, but fortunately the other party did not think about hurting themselves, otherwise I am afraid that the soul has broken and died, or the consciousness has dissipated into an idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piero shook his head and said that he did not see it, but he quickly guessed what Lucian might have encountered and sighed: "Sil Ms. Vija and many aristocratic ladies are good friends. You may see one of them, and it is a knight who inspires the blood. Because you are rudely staring at Ms. Silvia’s legs, she is slightly inclined by her. I suppressed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, unfortunately, Ms. Silvia is only a civilian, or she may have become a lady of a nobleman, but she It’s not something that people who haven’t passed the assessment of our musicians can hope, unless they are the same musicians as her, or famous musicians and great musicians who can be engraved in history!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of the first knight, countless hours of accumulation, people found that although human beings can not be like powerful creatures such as dragons, descendants are born, with age Big, the strength will gradually become stronger, Pulse power must be acquired through exercise and efforts to inspire, but if it is two knights, or a combination of the descendants of the Knights, their children, are often more likely to stimulate blood force than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strength is the guarantee of status, so for centuries, the nobles chose to marry the same excellent bloodline aristocrats, or knight descendants, for the sake of future generations, except A few of the Romeo-like characters who can give up everything for love, there is basically no situation where a civilian woman is married. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the sigh of Piedru’s sigh, Lucien’s heart speculated: “I’ve seen Sir John, who I’ve seen myself before, The two ladies are probably more powerful. Could it be that Ms. Natasha, a friend of Ms. Silvia’s rumor, is the horrible middle-aged woman who protects her strong?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is the only one who can become a sixth-level knight in one step, and can protect her, at least the strength of the Knights. It is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after Wayne’s speculation, he laughed again: [What do I want to do? What kind of princess she is, what kind of strong, what has to do with me. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Piedru sighed, thinking jumped to Lucien: "Lu Xien, study piano, although you can't surpass me, but Keep in mind that only music is your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit The tired Lucian struggled to noon and refused to join Piru for lunch, then went to the piano room on the fourth floor to practice the instrument and prepare to go home for an hour of sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking down the stairs, Lucien saw Elena with a very sweet smile and a young man in gorgeous aristocratic clothing. The man talked cheerfully. He was tall, with a dazzling blond hair and profound and beautiful facial features. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was Lu Xi’an who came down, the young aristocrat who smiled gracefully and said goodbye to Alina, passing by Lucien and going upstairs Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena rubbed her face and looked at the stairs. When the young aristocrat went upstairs, she whispered: "How could it be my sweetheart, that is the famous playboy of the association, McCann? Gerry. Fes, the student of Othello's governor, the second heir to the Griffith family, yes, Lucien, the cousin of your classmate Lott, who is good at harpsichord and violin, oh, smirk My face hurts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to smirk? Politely say hello to him?" Lucien joked a sentence and was prepared to leave. But Elena’s answer made Lucien very strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena is very disgusted with the earth: "Because he misbehaves, the private review is very bad. It is rumored that a civilian girl refused him. A few times, the result was him... How could a civilian girl like us cope with him? Fortunately, he is a proud person, and he feels that his charm and status are irresistible to any girl, as long as he does not stimulate him, no Cold and cold to him, let him feel special, feel that there is no problem to conquer, after all, he is very busy, often there are many blind, vanity girls around him, how can he have time to pay special attention A civilian girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privilege of the nobility is particularly strong in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Elena is only temporarily avoiding the danger. If he suddenly has a chance, you are not in danger? Everyone's emotions And the idea, but even I can't grasp it." Lucian said a little worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena shook her head helplessly: "It’s only a day, but the time he came to the association is very regular. Most of the time can be avoided in advance. Kai, Kathy, well, he has no interest in Casey, but he is afraid of her entanglement, huh, he is such a person who might inherit the title, how can he marry a civilian girl?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine." Lucian nodded. "In any case, you will get married in two or three years."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From past chats, Lucien knew that Elena was two years older than herself, almost twenty, and that in the Aalto, and even the civilian class in this world, it was a representative of late marriage. When she gets married and has her own family support, she must change her job relatively easily and not all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena heard the words of marriage, and suddenly sighed, full of grief and jealousy: "Lu Xien, you think, see this in the association The more up-and-coming people see their luxurious life. After seeing so many young and promising musicians, will I still think about going back to the past? Can I just find someone to get married?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the human eye is open, it will never be reconciled to the ordinary life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what are your plans?" Reluctantly a good friend, Lucien asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena smirked and the voice regained sweetness: "Maybe try out from those young musicians and young people who have the potential to become musicians Find a husband who is my husband, huh, huh, in fact, if McCann is not so fancy, so sullen, become a mistress of a nobleman, perhaps a good choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, no kidding, secretly telling you, Lucien, I have already married a lot of Yinnar, ready to become a musician student, learn music, and become a qualified musician in the future. And even the musician, well, Ms. Silvia is my goal! She is so beautiful, so musical, her life can be her own, and 24 years old is unmarried, in the hearts of most men in the association, But she doesn't think she is weird. Instead, she thinks she is a goddess who concentrates on music. I don't know how many people secretly like her, except for Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor's The lady has passed away ten times. But he has not remarried, to concentrate on the music, the feelings of people who know each lady can tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Elena, you have your own ideas, your own ideals, good things, well, do you want to follow any musicians or musicians to learn music?" Ms. Silvia?” Lucien appreciates this kind of girl who can work hard on her own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena nodded. "It’s best to be Ms. Silvia, but she rarely accepts students. I’m afraid it’s a bit difficult.” She said, she was green. The clear eyes looked at Lucien and joked: "Or else, when you are a good musician, you will be a good musician to collect me as a student?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
