			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Magic" journal, Lucien was there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone is curious about this way? Evans has not yet obtained the official arcane level and can write such an experimental paper with the thinking of the Arcane Master. In order to go to the "Magician Management Department" to adjust his own information, he will find himself from the mainland, is an ancient inheritance magician. And the name is exactly the same as the big musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a big deal at this point, from the west across the sea? Evans may be a musician, and it may also be an ugly and eerie sorcerer, but the top of the Magic Council may not know his appearance. After all, they sent a magician to Aalto to see themselves, and because of Djibouti. In the eyes of the Principality, I am afraid that it is very relevant to "Professor" in the eyes of Felipe and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really going to be determined by the pale hand, and you’re in the whirlpool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien had a little sense of danger, and although it was discovered that a series of coincidences were needed, things tend to move in the wrong direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I originally expected the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" to be a low-level Arcanist. My experiment on ultrasonic positioning detection does not have an important surname, and it is hardly It may be seen by the top of the parliament, so I am confident that I will use my real name and don't worry about being debunked. When I publish important papers later, as long as I have a formal arcane level, everyone will subconsciously treat me as similar. K's local magician does not associate with musicians. If the strength grows fast enough, it may not be enough to be discovered as a 'professor'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who knows because of the free lab and cheap materials of my greed magic school, the application submitted by the storm-mastered students saw it, causing his curiosity, and the result was named by the Arcanist in his paper, just like being hung in The walls are the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this result is caused by accidents and coincidences, the real reason for the conclusion is that I am able to learn boldly in the Magic Council. And using magic The place of the law is too relaxed, too alert, and dangerous. Even if you want to use your real name, you should wait until you get a formal arcane level and fit into the group of Ariel's magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is another rare lesson and experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten seconds, Lucien thought A lot, once again reflect on yourself, if it is a mistake to say that it is a mistake to use the means of adventure before, then the current relaxation is another extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, are you happy to stay?" Rock sees Lucien's eyes staring at the "Magic" journal without focus, thinking he is happy. Lost, can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last low-level magician who was quoted by the Archaeologists of the Arcane Masters is still in the early 20s, even if Felipe The relationship between cell memory and therapeutic theology has been awarded the "Imperial Throne Award" by the Camelot Royal Demon Court and the pale hand modeled after the "Holm Crown Award", but he was already a second-level arcian. The three-ring magician, let alone Lucien, a ring magician without a formal arcane level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was awakened by Rock's voice, looked up at him a little blankly, and then tried to squeeze out a smile: "Yes, it was actually dominated by the storm." You quoted it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien rushed through the "storm dominated" paper, and the more he saw it, the more he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Summarizing all the magic experiments and data, we can see that the electromagnetic wave does have the ability to locate the probe, and the speed is much faster than the high frequency sound wave, just it The feedback is too vague, you need to design a special spell structure to filter the zoom. In addition to the partial spell structure of the auxiliary calculation, the requirements of the entire spell model are very high, I guess it will be a four-ring or five-ring magic, and it will be advanced Named 'The Eye of Lightning'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, we can also see that when the electromagnetic wave enters a certain high frequency, if the power and energy are sufficient, it It can directly cause the internal molecules of the target to collide and generate high temperature, and fuse them from the inside. It is a powerful magic that can deal with specific defensive enemies. However, due to the requirements of positioning, power, energy, conduction and maintaining high frequency electromagnetic waves. It's very high, this magic structure is also very complicated, I expect it will be a five-ring or six-ring magic, according to the habit of calling it 'Fernando's Lightning Furnace'." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then increase the frequency, then enter the field of light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien admire the storm master, he almost summed up the different frequencies of electromagnetic waves There are several main applications, if he thinks that the back is the field of light, I am afraid that it will create more magic, and also really explore the possibility of using electromagnetic waves to transmit sound or information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not ordinary people who can become a big arcian! They are often not lacking in wisdom, but are blinded and obstructed by their past experience. As long as they are inspired, they have the ability to change the times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I’ve been using a few of the electromagnetic wave applications that lie to arcane points and arcane points." Lucien sighed and sang "Magic" The journal handed them to Rock and K. Whether they like electromagnetic magic or not, at least the last discussion of electromagnetic wave applications should not be missed. If it can be popularized, it will change the life of the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Magic" journal began to be circulated in the hands of magicians, and Lucien quietly thought about things that might be debunked, although the chances were small, but It always makes people feel a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the progress of the experiment has been accelerated, and the best way to ensure safety is to rely on the big tree to enjoy the cool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can get the attention of the will of the element, the pale hand can't rush to deal with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, Lucien back When I came to God, I saw that Rock, Jerome, and Vernier looked at myself in an odd way. Only K was reading the paper carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to you?" Lucien asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernier’s small and straight nose wrinkled, and smiled bitterly: “I can already imagine Beyat’s expressions and words, they will proudly claim Electromagnetism is the main direction of future magic research, and electromagnetic waves are the real foundation of the whole world. Such an arcane thesis that shows the important surnames of different applications of electromagnetic waves is actually because of Lucien's little experiment. The paper was inspired..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't finish, but Lucien was able to understand her emotions, and when the two armies fought, they accidentally discovered that the enemy decided to win. The negative weapon is the inspiration that the comrades on his own side accidentally give, that is the feeling of wanting to be angry and feeling equally innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of Rock, Jerome and other teachers are equally complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this matter have to do with Lucien? The magical ability of electromagnetic waves has been discovered only to show that the strength of our magical parliament has improved, it is worth Happy things. We can study the elemental magic with peace of mind. The atoms, molecules, and elements actually exist there, and will not disappear because of the pride of Beyat." After reading the paper, K is low and thick. The sound is coming slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome also laughed: "I just remembered them, they were a bit uncomfortable, and they have nothing to do with Lucien."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, Lucien, when you don't have a formal arcane level, the paper will be quoted by the Arcane Master, and you will have a formal Arcane level, maybe You can publish the results of the extremely important surnames in the elemental field!" Roque waved his arm and tried to make his depression disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere quickly recovered, full of pleasant and open-minded discussions. Apprentices such as Annick did not leave, just like listening to the legendary story and listening to the magic teachers to discuss various magical problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is coming soon in the afternoon, teachers such as Rock and other teachers have taken the lead, and the magic apprentices such as Heidi have also got up and are ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Chely seems to be immersed in some kind of thought, and there is no action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celi, what's wrong with you?" Heidi patted her roommate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chely screamed, woke up, a little shy and very awkwardly glanced at Lucien: "I saw what Mr. Evans was discussing, It’s like seeing my father discussing with the knights in the villa, warm and full of life, not like the sinister mystery of the rumors. After coming to Allinge, everything I saw deeply touched me. As if I was making a sweet dream, I was shaken, but I was afraid I could not face it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
