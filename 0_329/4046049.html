As long as you guide me about this element, you can take it all away."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black nectar is the material needed for many magic and pharmacy of the Necromancer. According to the witch's record, she has participated in several magical gatherings in the family retreat. The black nectar is probably ten Yinnar. One is equivalent to the money that Lucien can't eat or drink for a month, and the deeper and more precious the color, even the price is only a symbol, because it is not so easy to find unless it is cultivated by itself. It is also possible to sell a high price for such a mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the jewelry box to the front, judging from the color, breath, shape, etc., it was really a black nectar, so he nodded slightly: "You Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, why is the article "A new element measured by the new method" in the "Arcane" journal? The element 'to describe the 'too' extracted from the sun stone, is the basic element not a geothermal feng shui?" Mercury nervously asked with a bit of uneasiness and trepidation, it seems that she herself knows that this problem should be about the ancient magic system. The important difference from the current magic system will subvert the elemental magic knowledge that he has learned in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s hands were shrunk in black robes, and after a while he meditated for a while, he said slowly: “Actually, I learned ancient magic, only However, when learning, experimenting, and performing magic, I always feel an inconsistency and know the conclusion, but I don’t know why it is the confusion of this conclusion. Therefore, I often think about this problem. There are some scattered and isolated ideas. Until I saw this "Arcane" journal, I saw some of the articles that contained profound and profound truths. Some of my thoughts gradually became clear, like the vines found a tree that can be attached, such as the first article. Gravity, this is not my thorough research on this aspect, but this article just explained the answer I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I just told you about the application of the formula, not the related magical basic principles. It takes only a few years and ten years to let you understand and master it, and because I myself barely understand that I have not studied it yet. Cheer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien from the "Arcane" journal, gradually calmed down in the excitement of touching the magic circle, wake up to the mysterious formal magician "Professor" is too invested, and there is no small problem. As a magician looking for the headquarters of the mainland Magic Council, he can understand and master the current magic system without any obstacles, know the gravity, know the fire. Feng Shui is not an element, but the two are contradictory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these magical apprentices can’t see it, the ancient heritage magicians that may exist behind them should not be seen, and they will not be in danger for a long time. But if they are known by the arcane masters and magicians from the mainland Magic Council headquarters, if they are suspected of being inserted by spies in the magician circle, they will doubt their identity, so Lucien rushes to spread things. Make up before you go out and shape yourself into a keen and thoughtful genius magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I have not been able to calm down to the level of inhumanity, but also because of excitement, excitement, etc., when killing people in the sewer, facing The strong and calm state of the dead body should be psychologically prepared in advance, and the maturity brought about by various experiences during this time, the potential of itself has been developed, and it is understood from the body to the soul that it must not be nervous in the face of danger." Lucien’s inner self-reflection, while continuing to say:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The New Element Determined by the New Method” does not have many formulas, it is a standard. The result-type magic experiment, for the element theory mentioned inside, I can only talk about my own opinions in a shallow way, you need to judge whether it is correct or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury has no uneasiness and trembling in the sweet voice. It can be seen that she is not much worse than Lucian in her focus and calmness: "Okay, Professor, if that is the case, let other companions listen. Well, you also come to judge "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of "Mercury" magic material gives Lucien the explanation and guidance. If she is not willing to disclose it, it will be private communication, important. The part will even use "transportation", but it seems that the mercury is a bit embarrassed by the words of Lucien, so it is open to see the understanding of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is specific, I have not studied it clearly, but from this article, at least the current mainstream inside the magician should redefine the elements and discover new elements..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment in this article is to use the closed magic array with the nine-ring magic "flame storm" to bombard the sun stone magic material, after it produces a violent explosion, there will be a pure, beautiful Silver-gray crystal, hardness, flexibility and surname is better than Mithril, and relatively lighter than Mithril. It is a brand new element. It is a precious material. It is named because it is found in the sun stone. "too". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien speaks while judging from the article the progress of the magical world on the element: "It should be the definition of the element and start In addition to the conventional elements, new elements are discovered, but from the description of surnames and the like, there is no such thing as predicting the surname of the element's regular surname, but the surname of the element is related to the element on the earth. A lot of differences, which leads to some magic that is beyond imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to Sean casually raise a few apprenticeship elements of magic and everyday life As evidence of the material of the article, after talking about the elemental problem of "ground fire feng shui", Mercury and other magic apprentices were briefly silenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Professor, I, I think you are right, I am old... I have encountered many problems in learning elemental magic, if I change to this Explain, it will be easy to solve, thank you very much!" After a while, the sound of mercury in the mercury voice was very excited to thank Lucien, and almost said that he missed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged person also said in a cold and strange voice: "Mr. Professor, can you talk more about the elements, whether the soul is also a strange element? What constitutes? The magic materials and articles that I bring, although there is no grudge, but you can choose another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be dead Spiritual magic is mainly studied. Because there is no article about Necromancer in this issue of Arcane, you can only ask for elemental questions related to Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small, sage, white gloves, white honey and other apprentices have finished the elemental problem in Lucien, and there is no doubt about his identity, but rather He believes that he is the most powerful and powerful magician he has ever seen. The research on elemental magic is not as good as mercury, but it is the analysis of several apprentice-level elements that Lucian used to prove. They made them feel refreshed. It seems that something is booming in their hearts. After hearing the words of the hanged, they all looked at them and looked at Lucien with expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "I am not good at the problem of the soul, there is no way to explain it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying, Lucien received three small corpses from his own small pocket, and pulled the small wooden box with a set of magical experimental utensils from the sage. By the side: "Who do you bring black nectar and grudge dust? You can ask questions, but also let me buy with money, exchange magic materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water ghost brain tissue can do seven or eight experiments, and one experiment consumes one diced mushroom. Of course, Lucien can collect more points and collect more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the control of the church, black sesame mushrooms can not be cultivated, only in the Melzer Black Forest can be found, so it is rare, except mercury, other There is no such thing in the hands of the people." It seems that the sage of this magic circle leader, with a slightly old voice, respectfully explained to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also participated in two other magic circles, but the official magicians were very proud, not really impressing their items, or their magic apprentices. I don't want to get their guidance at all. Therefore, when the knowledge is better than the mysterious "professor" who is a lot of arrogant magicians and willing to guide himself to such magic apprentices, the sage is grateful and admired from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a magic circle of white honey nod to the sage: "Mr. Professor, black turkey, if you need it for a long time, once I get it, it will be for you. Keep it, but the grudges are harder to find. The formation of grievances is either a unique environment, or a tragic encounter in front of a ghost or a strong emotion that cannot be let down, and it is easy to be discovered by the church. Purification, as for the method of summoning the spirit of evil with the blood of evil creatures, I am afraid that the blood of evil creatures is harder to obtain than the dust of the spirits. After all, here is Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Black hens are long-term needs before my magic experiment, and the grievances are also dusty." Lucien was slightly disappointed, and thought that this time, except for the moonlight rose, which was monopolized by the church and the nobility. Other items, but this sentiment was quickly solved by Lucian, because this is just a circle of magic apprentices. "Well, take out the magic materials you brought. If there is what I need, I will be able to get a question." machine . Of course, the problem of value depends on the value of magic material "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
