			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of ​​a similar arrangement was originally created in this way. I just came into contact with the redefined elemental magic, so I exchanged many of the elements of the last name for the paper and purified. The elements, while verifying the surnames of each aspect according to the design of the paper, write the same surnames of the same element, including their oxides, onto a card, and then arrange the cards from the elements with the smallest atomic weight. It is easy for me to remember, understand and apply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this arrangement, I was surprised to find that the surname of the element represents a repetition of the cycle name, even The atomic valence states discussed in the latest Elemental Journal also present an incredible but equally wonderful array of arithmetic, all of which seem to be related to the arrangement of atomic weights from small to large. So I immediately had a bold assumption. Is the element surname quality an external representation of atomic weight? Is it possible to build a logical elemental system based on the atomic weight of the element, providing us with the ability to find, discover new elements and create new elements? Based on the rules of reference, I followed the system several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming that the element has a periodic surname, Lucien boldly guessed the atom. The internal microstructure also has protons, electrons, etc., but before any magic experiments and theoretical proofs, only the atomic weight can be used to rank, otherwise it will exceed its own "Arcane level." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the beginning, it is the basis for the arrangement of Lucien, the physical and chemical surnames of the elements, the surnames of their compounds and alchemical products, and then Regularly draft a table containing sixty-five elements and summarize: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this periodic table of my test, you can clearly see each A vertical row of elements has a similar surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."And according to the similarity of surnames, I did not mechanically follow the atomic weight, and It is appropriate to leave vacancies and correct the atomic weight of some elements, because they cannot be arranged in the correct position according to their current atomic weight. Based on this, I boldly guess that the atomic weight data of these elements is wrong in itself, suggesting arcane The teachers re-measured and measured them in different ways, and the results should be similar to my corrections. This can also prove the correctness of my periodic table of elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......"Depending on the continuation of the similarity of the surname, I Boldly predict that in the vacant place will be new elements that have not yet been discovered, I call them aluminum-like, silicon-like, they should have the surname of ..., respectively, may be found in ore similar to ...."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..."This is my explanation and guess about the relationship between the surname and the atomic quantity of the element, I hope to get the verification of the Arcane Master."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stopped the quill, looked at the paper repeatedly, sighed softly on it, put it in the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of atoms that need to be corrected, in part because strange isotopes cannot be separated, this part of Lucien does not expect the magicians to find in a short time. Separation, while the rest is either early in the determination of atomic weight, many methods have not yet appeared, or there is a problem in purification, the result has a small error, but there is nothing wrong with the use, and the measure is high-order The surgeon, then he was ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Lucien has verified their correct atomic weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the lab, the winter night was dark, and Lucien put his hands in his double-breasted black long dress pocket and slowly returned to his garden villa. I was thinking about the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a laugh behind the scenes: "Mr. Evans, you are going to resume the course on Monday, don't you know that you are prepared for serious teaching?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is low but there is a mocking smile, it is Beyat, he just finished his own magic experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked back at him and smiled. "Sorry, Mr. Beyat, I have already taken a leave of absence from the principal, because I am going to Alin on Monday. The Magic Tower updates my Arcanist badge. You know, because in the previous issue of "Magic", my thesis was quoted by the Grand Arcian Master, the latest issue of "Sonic", "Electromagnetic", "Ordinary Olympics" There are a lot of researches in my journals and new magic in the journals such as the Instructor Monthly, about seven or eight. Oh, I forgot Mr. Beyat, you have never had such an experience, and brought up your sad things, I Sincerely apologize."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was angered by the ostentation and sarcasm of Lucien. After being punished, the guy who should have been low-key and stable is still so terrible. I really don’t know how to live! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Beyate stroked his black top hat and left the other ramp of the Magic Garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Bayat's figure and shook his head gently, such a guy who has been following his own terrible undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the garden villa, the inside is brightly lit, and six apprentices such as Annick, Lei Yiya, Sprint, who are coming to tutor on Saturday afternoon are still in the living room. Written in the book, the coffee table in front of them or the low table has one after another calculation paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, good evening." When they saw Lucien returning, they seemed to be awake from the illusion of isolation, and they nodded their eyes and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently squeezed his head and smiled: "How was the last volume done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's so hard! I think some can't understand the problem, they are too weird!" The most lively Heidi answered with anger and anger, and other apprentices included Wen Li's Cherie, Sly's Sprint, etc. Slightly nodded and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "This is an exercise to help you exercise your thinking skills. Don't do it with a reckless way. Ok, take it back, down. Give me one Saturday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this true? Olympiad! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing to leave, Heidi and Reyia couldn’t endure the cheers of excitement and liberation, then spit out their tongues and bowed their heads and dared not look at Lucien The rest of the apprentices are either signs of happiness or obvious or weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien pretended not to see, and told the maid to send these apprentices to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices walked out of the garden villa and looked back at the subconscious. This candlelit black villa is like a monster hidden in the darkness. People are consuming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently shuddered, Heidi looked at the test paper in his hand: "Lei Riya, Cherie, Annick, are we doing something wrong?" Don't look for Mr. Evans to tutor! Too tired and too painful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I think the progress is obvious." Plint, "We are not a formal magician. It hurts a little bit and has something to do with it. It is not easy for a good teacher like Mr. Evans to come across."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina and Annick agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi mourned: "I know, but it’s really a headache, I want to have a good weekend! Mr. Evans is really a demon, I am to him. Dear and hate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no objection to this sentence, even though Sprint has drummed his cheeks, obviously agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At 9 am on Monday, a carriage slowly stopped in front of the General Assembly of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, white shirt, brown vest, black double-breasted long dress, pays the car to the coachman, puts on a black top hat, calmly steps Go up the steps. When I got here, the undead disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gate, Prosper screamed in a weak voice: "Welcome to the Magic Council headquarters. As long as you refine a female surname, Taling, you I will be warmly welcomed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ignored Prosper, it said this to every magician who came here, directly Entered the fourth district "Magician Management Department". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy, who had just received a magician, was slightly surprised to see Lucien, and then licked the beautiful brown eyes: "Hey, who is this?" Mr. Evans, who hasn’t been out at Douglas Magic School for more than a month!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and complained slightly, how many months have been in Allinge for more than a month Friends who don’t meet each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, isn't this our big celebrity? The paper is Mr. Evans quoted by the Archaic Master! You haven't forgotten that we are so good." Na also expressed her welcome in an exaggerated tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s attitude is not cold. I didn’t alienate myself because of her fame. The two magic apprentices were happy and shared the interesting things of the Parliament’s headquarters with Lucien, such as Lazar’s “Elemental Will”. What kind of meeting will be held after the month, and was called to the Rantat preparation. For example, the Bruker Arcane Master who proved that "the light is the electromagnetic wave" got the "Silver" jointly established by the Burriana Magic Court and the Silver Moon Alliance and the High Tower. The monthly medal, this is the highest honor of the electromagnetic system, the star system, the light and dark system - this does not make any sense to the Archangel Master, this is his third. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status is similar to the elemental system, the alchemy "Holm Crown Award", in addition to the "immortal throne" of the Necromancer, the electromagnetic system, the star system, the light The dark "Silver Moon Medal", as well as the "Witches Laurel" jointly established by the Calais and the Wizards House, is mainly aimed at the magical factions that preserve the knowledge of the ancient magical empire, such as change, illusion and summoning, and the Northland. With the "The Ice and Snow Medal" set up by the Department of Thermal and Force Fields, the "Earthic Scepter" award for the force field, the star system and the purely mathematical knowledge set by the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all created after the appearance of the "Holm Crown Award". In order to maintain a fair image, the Magic Council did not intervene, but simply as a supervisor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After chatting with Cindy for a while and learning about the latest developments at the Magic Council headquarters, Lucien knocked on Eric’s office door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s stiff and serious face reveals a suspicious smile: “Evans, are you going to update the badge?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw that Lucien’s paper was quoted by the storm, and he expected that he would come back to update the Arcane and Magic badges after the release of this month’s issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and nodded: "Yes, trouble Mr. Eric, you. But before the update, I have two things to do, one I was inspired by this month's arcane and magical learning. I wrote a new arcane thesis and wanted to submit it to the audit committee. The other one is that I want to apply for the basics of the Arcane." Eric _ quietly listened, and it was not surprising that Lu Xien submitted another paper. After quoting with the Arcanist, Lucien did not have the confidence to try to write a thesis, which would not meet the characteristics of his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can hear the latter half of the sentence, Eric is blurted out: "Really? Are you sure? How long have you been learning arcane?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of three questions fully revealed his surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, although I have been studying for about three months, I feel that I have a good arcane talent and I have mastered the foundation. Mr. Eric, Isn't that strange? Lord Brooke passed the Arcane Foundation exam at the age of 11." Lucien boasted unhurriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric feels ridiculous: "But Lord Brooke has been studying for two years, not three months!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have a magical foundation, an adult's memory and thinking ability, a mature learning method, and it is clear whether it passes the assessment." Lucien answered with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric light gray eyes stared at Lucien’s eyes and saw that he did not waver, so he sighed: “Since you are evaluated as having The surgeon thinks, then I will test you to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going to the assessment room, Eric randomly wrote the Lucian arcane thesis " The word "element" was put into the iron cage and the bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The same wide house, the same bell ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death? Turn Mr. Pesor, Ms. Tina Dimos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... "Elements? Mr. Gaston, Mr. Avery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In a room filled with different bottles of different elements, one The brown earth element blinks red light, picking up the paper from the magic transmission array::<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the period surname between the elemental surname and atomic weight Relationships and predictions of some new elements, hey, a magician who has no official Arcane level, and a question about the elemental cycle name that has not progressed for a long time, will not bother Mr. Gaston, he is in Renta There is something special about it. The headquarters of the "Elements" journal is also in Rentat, and there is no need to overwork the letter of Matthew's flight. Just after Mr. Larry is there, he will be handed over to him for review."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
