			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---Forget it is Monday, sweat, click, recommend and Sanjiang ticket, you have to work hard to stay in the first ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;................................................................................................ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After accepting the advice of Lucien and Rhein, Victor came up with a very simple piece for Lucien to read the music, this is his music for himself. The piano entry song written by the students, because it needs to be simple, so there is not much gorgeous decorative sound, when it pops up on the original harpsichord, it is limited by its shortcomings, and can only be barely counted as listening, but in the current piano. Playing on, there is a melody like a song, a purely beautiful feeling, although it is not a famous song, but it is enough to spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the soul and spirit are tempered by the meditation, Lucien’s memory is getting better and better, even if only a few days of music foundation, In the past ten times, he completed the preliminary reading, which is similar to that of the aristocratic students who were influenced by music, such as Lott and Felice, and made Victor's face show a happy smile again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, Lucien, you try to play the string in the front part, don't worry, the first time what happens is normal, but I must remember to keep fingering. If you don’t panic, you can move your fingers. As long as you don’t make mistakes, you can master this song for a while.” Victor gave the basic fingering points to Lucien and then directly gave way to Lucy. En began to play, not like the introduction of the piano fingering tutorial in Lucien's mind, there is a process of familiarity with fingering and keys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this piece of music is very simple, such direct practice and the piano part of the introductory part of the previous part of the combination of learning, similar, thinking, logic, simple children learn It will be very difficult, but for adults like Lucien, they can adapt to it after a lot of practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s hands are like holding an egg on the keys, watching the scores in front of him, thinking back quickly, then press Come down and start playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are intermittent notes coming out, Lucian is playing very hard, and it feels very simple when I remember it, but when I actually play it, I find it very difficult. I clearly remember which note I played, but I didn’t correspond to the key. I had to match the key. I wanted to direct the finger to press the time. I also wanted to refer to the fingering. I couldn’t make mistakes. Which finger should be used accurately, and I can understand this. The extension of the fingers seems to be less coordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another sound in the front of Lucien before the sound was finished, and the piano sounded intermittently like the voice of the last words before death. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Lucien has been trained in spellcasting, and so many dangerous situations, the scenes of the dead, even if it is slower, there is no panic, no urgency I rushed to catch the notes so that they were wrong, mixed, and anxious. The whole string was also called a lot of noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Lott, Felice and Herodotus, listening with a deep smile, did not mean to laugh, because they were the first The same was true when playing the second time, even worse than Lucien, ridiculing Lucien is tantamount to laughing at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is not long, but the string of one minute or so has been popped up by Lucien for more than three minutes. After the bomb is finished, the road Sean discovered that there was a cold sweat behind his back, and his forehead was also a dense sweat, and there was a feeling of killing people in the sewer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, Victor took the lead to applaud and praise Lucian: "Although Lucien is playing very slowly, it is very poor, but Among the ordinary beginners I have ever seen, the only one that can play the first time is to keep the notes without errors. This calmness allows you to master the piano fingering more quickly, but sometimes you need to put in music when playing the music. Feelings, too calm and not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein, Lott, etc. followed the applause, they were the first performance of Lucien. It’s impossible to think of Lott, Felice and others in exporting Lu Xi’an. It’s impossible. The pride and pride of the nobility and the scholars made them feel that they didn’t think so. Especially Herodotus was very annoying. Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Victor said, as an excellent performer with harpsichord and harpsichord, Rhein commented on two sentences and pointed out the current problems of Lucien. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien Your memory is very good. After learning and playing a few times, you should be able to remember the position of the keys, even if you practice The extent to which you can see the score or the music immediately instinctively reacts, I believe it will take less than a month, but I noticed that the coordination name of your hands is relatively poor, that is, the notes you want can't react to the action of both hands. Go up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, this is a skilled problem. As long as you can practice hard, the fastest two or three years, the longest is no more than ten years, you can become a qualified musician. As for whether it is outstanding, it depends on whether you have music talent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows that even if a famous teacher points out, it takes a long time to practice a good instrument, but I want to earn my current life by becoming a musician. The cost, the cost of casting materials, and the cost of magical laboratory equipment, it is inevitable that there is a little disappointment: "Mr. Victor, Mr. Rhein, is there no way to become a qualified musician faster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless you are a true genius in music and have an unparalleled understanding of music, you may be able to master an instrument in a few months, but unfortunately, you are not. So a solid foundation, a long practice is you. The only way to become a qualified musician, I don't want to hear people say that Mr. Victor's music student is a fool who can't even play the piano." Felice, who is good at satirizing others, finally hears after she hears Lucian's delusions. Do not He rebuked his sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herodod smiled and listened to Felice, only pretending to be kindly: "Lu Xien, you must have a solid foot on your feet. The earth can go further and faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Lucien, you only begin to learn, don't underestimate the difficulty of learning instruments. "Loth is not as disgusted with Lucien as the other two, just follow the advice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein reveals a smile: "Young people have ideals, and it is good to have energy. But the practice of musical instruments needs countless times. Don't look at me playing the violin. Harpsichord, harpsichord and harp, but that is a long time piled up. Oh, there is actually a way to let you master a musical instrument in the shortest possible time, that is to inspire your blood and become a knight. The control of the body, the control of the hands and feet will become very strong, the coordination of the surname is natural, and with your good memory, you may become a qualified piano player in a week or two." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it doesn't matter how long it takes you to motivate the blood, whether it is longer than a few years or ten years. I don't know." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha." End of the rhythm of Rhein, so that Victor, Lott and others could not help but laugh, how hard it is to stimulate blood, look at the Principality The number of knights will be known, regardless of Lott, Felice, It is Herodotus, and it is the loser on the road of the Cavaliers. I feel that if I persist and do not hope to succeed, I will turn to the path of musicians. To Lu Xi’s age, I want to stimulate my blood. I might as well expect that I am Musical genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor puts a smile on his face: "If you just want to play a complicated piece of music, then you practice for four hours a day, three or four weeks without interruption, you should be able to reluctantly Qualified, but what's the use? Well, Lucien, study the piano in a down-to-earth manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien had nodded, silently After the income and expenses of his own, the salary of ten Yinnars per month, which must pay three Yinnar to the home of Eliza, as their own monthly meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I miss the delicious food including the Western food in the past, I want to try to do something delicious to comfort myself, but I am at the crucial moment of magic and music learning. I really don't want to give more thoughts to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are seven Yinnars left, waiting for the tension in the city of Aalto during this time, probably spending five to six Yinnar per month. Buying magic materials, as for rebuilding a secret magic laboratory, and purchasing glass bottles, glasses, stoves, special cans and other items inside, it is a big expense, it is likely to beat yourself from the gangsters, cultists All the silver coins that I got were thrown in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these magical experiments require utensils, especially glassware, that are very sensitive, in their own condition, once purchased, it is easy to be suspected and magical experiments Related, this makes Lucien a headache, I don't know how to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Lucien also intends to buy two black linen garments, as well as some worn fabrics and sewing needles, threads, etc. The robes with hooded hoods are convenient for concealing activities at the same time. At the same time, a row of small pockets are sewed in the belt lining to install different casting materials, so that it is difficult to distinguish after the post-casting materials are added. And carried it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this matter, Lucien can only use self-deprecating to ease depression: "The pressure of life, let me this magician begin to learn the needle thread, this What is the world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
