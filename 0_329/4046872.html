			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prairie scenery that is very different from the coastal corridors of the four countries of the Straits and the Northland, as if all kinds of grassland creatures have been produced, it is presented in the "audience". In the eyes, lead them to experience exotic flavors and enjoy the visual feast that was unimaginable in the past. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who might not have left their city or kingdom, such a novel shock makes them feel like they are crazy, as if the soul is really in the body In the prairie, it was fascinated by the vast and fresh scenery there, and was screamed and screamed by scenes of predation on the grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Mills Aristocratic School, the same "live screen" stands in the central square of the teaching area, and the aristocratic students who just finished the evening class are attracted in twos and threes. Then the feet were glued to the ground by the alchemy, and there was no way to move half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the prairie?" The quiet and simple eyes of Wen Jing have looked at the green on the screen, which is in line with the reading of the book on the prairie. All romantic fantasies, so it is difficult to restrain, whispering, but this time the impact is much smaller than the last time in the vast starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic friends with her also expressed their own shocks to varying degrees, even though they have villas, manors, trees, and hunting grounds in their homes. In the Kingdom of Holm, where to look for the seemingly endless prairie, it is only the moving landscape that is only opposite the Stormy Strait and the southern part of the Gusta Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, they are also considered to have a lot of beauty, they are much more tolerant than ordinary citizens, and they will not completely lose their voices and completely "lost" themselves. It is also possible to greet and whisper while subconsciously whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This live broadcast is so unexpected. I just thought that the program "Human and Nature" was very interesting. It was discovered today that it is so shocking. "The noble ladies are more or less interested in pursuing romance." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not called live broadcast, before Miss Nightingale said it was satellite TV, a good-looking novel:" Jane's friend corrected his companion's opinion. Then I put my hands on my face and I felt my cheeks were hot and excited. I used a dreamy tone. "I really want to go to the prairie, sit on the back of the wild horse, and watch the setting sun shine on the greenery of the sky." Jane, last time you went to the stars. Is the scenery more romantic than this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this topic has been repeated many times, the vast sky is always a Yearning for romance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the stars are much more beautiful than the ground, pure and pure, a few have beautiful halos..." Jane does not bother to describe again, that time What I saw and heard was deeply imprinted on her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, "human and nature" ends. Returning to the "live room" again, "Night" smiled: "Starting next Monday. 'The Voice of Mystery' will be stopped on the 'People and Nature' program, only on the 'Aringe' satellite TV's sky Channel 'play, correspondingly, we will also make major improvements and adjustments to other columns, so that broadcast and satellite live broadcast can play their respective advantages. Next, you will see a brand new program, exclusive to 'sky' The program on the channel, which is different from any of the past, will bring you a new and wonderful experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear friends, you are ready "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet voice of "Night" penetrates into the ears of every listener, giving them the shock from the previous "Prairie and Animal World" Zhongqing woke up - even those who have experienced rich adventures, no one has been to the southern desert of the Gusta Empire and the southern prairie, naturally attracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What brand new show?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than the previous 'Prairie' Exciting programs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "nightingale" makes the audiences in different places like Lang Man, Jane, Ali, etc. curious, full of expectations . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night" Louise continued: "If you are ready, let's have a 'exploration tour'!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft glow appears and slowly dissipates. There was a blue sea on the screen, the waves were undulating, and the seabirds were flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if the aristocratic sons of Jane did not have the experience of taking a boat trip to the sea, they basically went to the seaside cities such as Padre Harbour and enjoyed the coolness and the waves of the sea, so they were relatively calm and confusedly exchanged: "This is not the case." "Mr. Nightingale" is so good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't think it's a brand new experience."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane looked at the live screen, but the heart is rather calm, in the past many years, "Sound of Mystery" has never let himself wait for people to disappoint, I believe that "Sky TV" will certainly not! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "vision" is getting closer, a steam giant ship appears in the eyes of everyone, and the eight magical cannons with the effect of the Lutheran fireball are mighty. With the Quartet, the "line of sight" is drawn closer again, allowing the audience to see the two men and two women on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the waters off the island of Sinai. We accepted the commission of the islanders to investigate the recent large number of dead fish floating in the sea..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On Sinai, there has always been such a legend that many years ago, it used to be a magician’s territory, but one day later, he It never appeared again, and from that day on, the islanders often heard the crying of the miserable monks at night, and they will see the green flame floating in the sea, and occasionally lost a few days while driving out to sea and fishing. It is said that when the fishermen are lost, if they encounter lightning storms, they will see a 'lighthouse' they have never seen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magnetic sound 娓Hey, come, listen to Langman, this minor is standing up, is this program a show of horror stories? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 'Exploration Tour' will be led by two mid-level magicians and two great knights to uncover the reasons behind these mysterious events. Look for the treasures that may be left behind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the introduction of the commentary, the lean middle-aged man on the deck sorted out his classical magic robe "I am Griers, good at illusion, necromancer and elements. I am the captain of this 'Exploration Tour', we are about to arrive in Sinai, a good-looking novel:"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigate mysterious events, explore possible magic towers, and find hidden treasures. These terms are heard by Lang Man, Jane, Ali, and other ordinary people who have never had an adventure. Excited eyes, thoroughly invested in this "exploration tour" program, what is the cause? Can you investigate? Will you be in danger? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those adventurers, noble knights, magicians, etc., have had adventures, but never used this attitude to "experience" a game. Exploring, so equally stimulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam giant ship arrived in Sinai, where magicians, knights, apprentices, and attendants dispersed and asked the islanders to find clues. These scenes were methodically Presented in the eyes of the audience, let them more and more, even began a small analysis, "I" thinks that this may be the case, and later said that the testimony of several islanders is contradictory...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the survey, Griers and other magicians used their own skills to easily solve the problems that the audience thought, and they saw that they were dumbfounded and eagerly pursued the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half an hour of the show, after the "three days" of local time, the investigation has a preliminary conclusion, all the clues point to a certain sea area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we need to explore the seabed of this sea..." Griles speaks and performs auxiliary exercises such as "underwater breathing" and then leads The other three mid-level professionals drilled into the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True, really got into the water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to explore?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shocked voices sounded one after another, and I can’t believe that I would witness a real adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding water waves sway gently, and a fish that is only ordinary or odd-shaped swims briskly, watching the audience stunned, sometimes fierce sea monsters Come over, but it was solved by the knight and the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is such a quiet girl, she can’t help but pick up her heart. Although she lives a calm and peaceful life, she doesn’t like to change, but she always has a heart. There will be more or less adventure illusions, and when this fantasy can be experienced without having to complete it, she naturally devoted herself to marvel at the colorful magic and was scared by a sea monster that suddenly emerged. The fluctuations are more and more violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
