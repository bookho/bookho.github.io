			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien considers the language: "I don't understand the knowledge of astrology, I can only infer by comparing poetry and literature describing similar events. Of course, It may also be a prophetic poem. If so, every word is just an abstract reference and there is no guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien is currently best at It is the knowledge of astrology. The ecliptic position of the sun does have a constellation named after "Tanos", and it is to commemorate the "king of the sun." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is certainly not a prophetic poem, it is just a folk poem that is circulated around Aalto." Droni gave a positive answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly organized the language: "Because of the civil war and division of the magic empire itself, and the church leading the heroes westward, in the past few hundred years, Wars like the fall of meteorites, the shaking of the earth, the collapse of mountains, and the destruction of cities have occurred many times, from "The Collection of Folk Poetry in the Dark Ages", "The Ancient Wars of Syria", "The Holy City", "Confessions", "The Chronicle of the Sacred Mainland" You can find at least a few hundred similar descriptions on the books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strong confrontation between the two legendary fields can have a similar effect, although the last two Three hundred years are hard to see, but in the 'Twilight War', in the war against the heresy, this level of battle is not uncommon." Natasha nodded in favor of Lucian's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of this, I have always been very curious, it describes exactly which battle." Droni slightly reveals a disappointment on his gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed: "But the description similar to 'the red water is submerged in the lips' is rare, there is only one in the book of the Princess. The remote historical literature called "Marlou Manuscript" has a record of the changes in the terrain of the northwest of Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Prehistoric One Hundred and Fifteen Years, I don’t know whether it was man-made or natural disaster. The white scorpion near Aalto fell into the darkness. The huge meteorite fell from the sky, completely destroying the peaks of the northwest and the magic city 'Elsino'. After that, the earth cracked, red, not magma. The strange liquid rushed out of the ground and drowned nearby. Because the bloody liquid disappeared quickly, the literature and poetry to record this matter were very rare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Droni’s expression is a bit serious: “Luxion, what you mean is that this poem describes the birth of the 'Elsino' lake in the northwest of Aalto. How does the sun enter the palace of Thanos?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that too When the king's Tanos reached the peak of the legendary field, the magical imperial capital appeared for three days without the darkness of the sun, and used it to describe the darkness of the sky at that time." Natasha added reason to Lucien, "and The style of this poetry language is similar to that of that era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Droni nodded gently: "It seems that this poem should be then 'Elsino 'The survivors created, Princess Royal Highness, Lucien, can you see anything else from the poem?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha Shaking his head at the same time, the rest is a normal scene description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Droni looked disappointed, but he immediately smiled. "I can know the age and background of this poem, satisfying me all the time." Curious, I am very happy, thank you Princess Her Royal Highness, thank you Lu Xien. Hehe, you are a 'real' historian, I have consulted Mr. Baker before, but he does not know."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien replied modestly: "I just saw this manuscript and I am not completely sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sylvia's gentle smile stood up: "No matter what, thank you for satisfying my father's curiosity. Well, don't continue this topic, because dinner is ready, let us enjoy delicious food." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, taste it, a chef from Silvia is from Tria, and the Sula ancient dishes are very characteristic. It’s a rare taste. Aalto’s food is too monotonous compared to Tria’s food. Taste, always beef and beef stew, always fried steak, always sausage, fat goose and roast chicken..." Natasha expressed her strong dissatisfaction with Aalto food, it seems that she is also a favorite Gourmet guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was told by her: "Then I must taste it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even now, the chefs of the garden villas are just average, and the daily dishes are repeated to the extent that Lucien is numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha said that he was rising and complained more: "Actually, Aalto's food is not bad. If it is in Holm, it is in Rentat. The daily food is grilled fish, steak, chips and salad. It is the most unpalatable dish in the whole continent. I have never been to it once I was a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;holm? Rentait? Is it the country opposite the Stormwind Strait that is not recorded in the historical literature? Lucien thought silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia’s dinner is really good, the white napkins are placed with delicate porcelain tableware, and the three glass glasses are used to hold white water and red. Wine and Les wine, the first dish is fried foie gras, the second dish is Tria fish soup, the main dish is roast leg of lamb and white wine stewed tripe, followed by vegetable salad and Syracuse pudding cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gave Lucien an appetite, and after becoming a knight, the appetite also increased greatly, so the main dish was eaten three times. Fortunately, Silvia knows the condition of Lucien from the mouth of Natasha, and the food prepared for him is the same as Natasha and Camille. Normal people have a lot of weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter, Droni did not express any surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The cold wind of the "Ice Moon" whistling, Lucien, Natasha and Camille walked in the Jisu District on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvia was originally prepared to send them for a while, and Natasha persuaded him to go back. This kind of weather is really not suitable for her weak body to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is in the northern fortress, it should have been snowed." Natasha stretched out the white and slender hand, feeling the cold wind, the expression was slightly sentimental The land said to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked up at Silver Moon: "I haven't seen the snow, Arto rarely sees snowflakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a "historian" elaboration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha maintains that sentimental mood, and the voice appears soft: "Lu Xien, how was your sonata created? Can you? Completed by April 3rd? If you can, I plan to recommend you to have a concert at the Alto Music Festival at the Alto Music Festival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto The music festival is held every three years from April to May. Many musicians from all over the world come here, including the moon elves and gold dwarves who have converted to the god of truth. It is a festival of all continent music. There is a concert in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time period, you can hold a concert in the Hall of the Holy Grail, it can only be a very famous and very authoritative musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be able to finish." Lucien considered it and answered it earnestly. If a concert is successfully held at such a festival, it will surely satisfy the Rhine. Mr.'s request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and melted her sentimentality: "I believe you, I would recommend President Christopher. Oh, in order Let you create with peace of mind and ensure that the music is the first performance in the Hall of the Holy Ghost. When the New Year's dance is held, the serenade will not have to be played anymore. Freshness can always bring great shock to people."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, "Dedication to Silvia" is also played by me, keeping your piano performance to a certain degree of mystery." After all, in the past few months, Lucien was only Feili played once at the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not disappoint what your Royal Highness Princess wants." Lucien looked at the front with a slight confusion. After the festival, will he leave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining this, Natasha suddenly sighed: "I didn't think of romance after I played "Dedicated to Silvia" last night. The language just praises the beauty of Silvia. Lucien, you try to think about it, after a beautiful piano piece, in the beautiful melody that still wanders, the gentleman stands up from the piano and walks In the presence of a beautiful lady, slowly holding her right hand is a beautiful picture. If there are one or two deep and romantic words at this time, she will be able to impress her and let her remember forever."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
