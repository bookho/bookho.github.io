			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley was shocked first, almost didn’t scream, then she sneaked east and looked west, while walking fast and grabbing the dimension Center's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her anomalous reaction made Vicente feel overwhelmed and didn’t understand why she would be the reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley tried to suppress the voice and restrained her own fear and fear: "Vicente, flee, the night watcher found the body of your basement." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The loss hits Vicente like a meteor. The thing is so sudden that he can't believe it, even if the news is from his favorite. The most trusted Shirley spit out, "Impossible, this is impossible. How can the night watcher know that there is a dead body in the basement? How can I check me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vigil People's actions can be rigorous enough to investigate the situation of each household. There are no magicians in the world, and there are no night watchmen, because they are exhausted and exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley saw Vicente's emotional confusion, unable to take effective action, had to tell the story, but she concentrated as much as possible: "Andrew They felt that their dignity was humiliated, they found a night watchman to investigate you, and they intended to kill you in the interrogation room. My maid just heard their plot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's it, it turned out to be like this... I am not a magician, I don't want to be a magician... Why do they force me..." Vicente flustered and his emotions almost collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley is not willing to delay the time when Vicente hides, long story short: "Don't worry, I will let Dad come forward to guarantee you, then just check it. The Lord will understand that you are not a magician, but these days you go to the swamp to find hidden places to hide, so that Dad has time to communicate with other nobles and churches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Her well-organized words and not very flustered performance made Vicente's emotions gradually stable: "Well, I listen to you. Shirley."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, he can only pin his hopes on the Baron Brenzel, and it was not the case that there was no aristocratic sponsored magician suspect. Of course, I will be checked at the end. It is necessary to confirm if it is a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no time to prepare clothes and food for you. You should be careful in these days. If Dad’s actions are smooth, I will let the guards go to the edge of the swamp. Those who have imprinted the imprint are the ones we have agreed upon. "The relationship between the two of them has been strongly opposed by the Baronzel couples. For some time, even the letters could not be exchanged, so some simple imprints were gradually agreed. . Telling each other's own situation, and now, these marks can come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Vicente’s expression was a little nervous: “I seem to see a few black shadows shaking outside your manor?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a cat-like pupil. Vision is much stronger than ordinary people, and at this time they are hiding in the garden, surrounded by many plants, and it is difficult for people outside to find them directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The night watchman is coming..." Shirley whispered to herself as Vicente's fiancee. She had no doubt that the night watchman would come over to investigate, but she did not expect it to be so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente became very nervous, although the garden has many plants, but as long as you walk in, it is not difficult to easily see yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding in other houses in the manor? The night watcher will definitely search for one room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle. Quietly escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was in a panic, Shirley suddenly raised his head: "Vicente, you are hiding here first, I pretend to go to the west of the swamp to find you, lead The night watchman, five minutes later, you go to the east side of the swamp from the side door of the manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, yes, you will be very dangerous..." in the eyes of ordinary people In the middle, the image of the night watchman is as terrifying as the magician, the demon, and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley shook his head firmly: "Nothing, I am a nobleman, at most, I was asked to check a few words, Vicente, get rid of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the manor, the night watchman squad leader "mad dog" told his team members: "You spread out and hold the manor in different directions to prevent Vicente's evil magician from escaping. I and the "tamer" went in for a search and search. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the night watchman code-named "The Beastmaster" is much more useful than others, and the "magic creatures" he domesticated can come in handy. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, all the information points to the swamp. We are here only to investigate the swamp area where Vicente is constantly active. Don't you have to worry about it?" The team members felt that this was too late, the manor did not need to search and block for a while, and quickly interrogated, and then went to the swamp is the right way, lest anyone quietly ventilate the letter, let Vicente hide in the depths of the swamp, and in the environment there, This means that unless the squad of the Principality of the Principality is dispatched, the hope of catching it is extremely embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "mad dog" nickname is "mad", but at this time it is extremely serious and cautious: "No matter what time, you can't give up the night watchman round up The code must be blocked first, then enter the manor, can you be sure that only Vicente is a magician? Can you confirm that his fiancee has not been deceived? Can you believe that Baron Brunzer does not secretly support the magician?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions made the team shy and couldn’t lift their heads. They could only apologize constantly. If the captain was really crazy, he would have to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the pursuit of a young magician, the captain will also take the entire team out, he was worried that the nobles involved in this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to previous investigations, Miss Vicente and Miss Brunzer have a good relationship. Just stare at her, maybe we don't need to go deep into the swamp." The teacher added a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the "crazy dog" nose twitched, and suddenly issued the order: "each hidden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team members unconditionally obey his orders and scatter from the fields, woods and streams outside the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a minute, the figure at the gate of the manor came out quietly. She wore the maid’s clothes and wore a black cap on her head. The black gauze hangs down and covers the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked left and right, confirmed no one, and quickly and flusteredly headed for the swamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s Shirley, she can't beat my nose." "The mad dog" smirked and said to the "tamer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The animal trainer" smiled miserably: "She should be going to the swamp to inform Vicente, this kind of thing, she dare not deliver to the maid and Guard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary people who have no relationship will only choose to stand on the side of the truth church! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you are right, this task seems to be easy to complete." "Mad Dog" smile is extremely cruel, the referee's award, Andrew gave the reward. It’s a double harvest! If, if you can make things big, involve more people. That credit is even bigger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Shirley’s figure is about to disappear at the end of the road, he blew a strange bird-like whistle. Let the players regroup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We followed her, 'The Trainer' left to monitor the manor and prevent the Baron Brenzer from having a sudden situation." "The mad dog" commanded . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, captain." "The animal trainer" replied humbly, his "baby" is a lot, although it is impossible to monitor the entire manor, but focus on observation The gate and the Baron Brenzer are completely ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" in order to prevent Vicente and teachers like helpers. With the entire team outside the "tamer", he sneaked behind Shirley, followed her through the green fields, sparse woods, and gradually resisted the swamp filled with black fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly. The eyes of the "mad dog" were big, because he saw Shirley turning back and forth, even the edge of the swamp did not arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What secret did she use to contact Vicente?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "mad dog" burned in anger knows that it is too late to rush back. He directly jumped out of the secret place with the players and surrounded Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are you? What are you going to do?" Shirley shouted. Like a noble lady who met a civilian at a banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" gloomy face and touched his nose: "Miss Shirley, where is Vicente?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, how do I know? He disappeared after going to the swamp today." Shirley tried to calm herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" "Mad dogs" feel that they are increasingly unable to control their anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley said coldly: "Come to him, but after seeing the swamp. I understand that this is not the place where my noble lady can play, so I decided Going back, he died in it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you insist on this, I have to bring you back to the referee." "The mad dog" has a pair of eyes Blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare! I am a nobleman!" sherry shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mad dog" sneered: "What about the nobility? As long as it is related to the magician, the nobles will be tied to the firearm and tie her to me. I want her to know that the torture of the referee is not so good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mad, my father will protest to the church, you are waiting to accept the punishment. "Sheryl screamed a little unbelievably." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him protest!" "The mad dog" did not give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? The night watchman took Shirley to the referee?" Baron Brenzer asked in amazement and angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After confirming the information, he was furious: "This group of madmen will not put the nobility in the eye! Also obey the law of the Principality!" I am going to church, I am going to find the Viscount!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rushed out angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long day, he couldn’t believe the expression came back. In the face of his wife’s continuous questioning, he just said: “How can this be, the church will not The opinions of our nobles are in the eyes, even threatening me, saying that if I have problems, I will catch them together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church people Is it crazy? Are you afraid of the aristocrats of the Principality to resist?” Baroness Brunsell could not believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron Brunel shook his head and said: "Rebel? Is resistance useful? Can you beat the church?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interrogation room of the referee, the sharp voice of women has been echoing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't confessed to the whereabouts of Vicente?" "The mad dog" asked the interrogator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator looked gloomy and said: "No, everyone who I have met is tough, her body is completely paralyzed, or refused to confess." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That works directly with the magic." "The mad dog" swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator suddenly looked at him: "She will die, she is a noble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, a nobleman." The attitude of the church today made the "mad dogs" bolder and decided to make a great contribution. Anyway, their marriage with the magician is definitely not a good thing. The Lord will agree to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator stunned and said: "It’s time for the group of nobles to recognize their identity. They are just our dogs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strode into the interrogation room, and the scream slowly turned into a nightmare scream. At the end, even the screams disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
