			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe used his surname to insert it back into his black trench coat pocket, his expression was gloomy, but there were countless thoughts in the heart: "Either professor is real The madman, or he does have a certain grasp of the life material contained in the body or the non-life thing (cheng-ren)!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of guy who can purify the sequence is a madman who is completely ignorant. On the other hand, he believes that he has made a breakthrough in the field of elements and necromancers, which has both subversion and surname, and can be loaded into the history of magic. It will be the next one. The winner of the 'Holme Crown' award. Oh, no matter which side you choose to believe, it is difficult to convince yourself. It is no wonder that the professor's evaluation of the purification sequence is very embarrassing and extremely dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bet him, or go straight to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe hesitated, strong curiosity and confidence in his own necrotic magic Let him want to see if the professor can really refine it. The material of life, whether it is really subverted after the other basic theories of ancient magic, has finally reached the "human body mechanics theory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the attitude towards knowledge as a fourth-grade arcian in his early thirties! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to apologizing, there seems to be no loss to teach you?" Felipe slowly opened his mouth and let the wizards and apprentices who did not know where to go. More and more eyes widened, the powerful Necromancer Felipe was also infected by the absurdity and madness of the professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienqiang resisted the inner joy, and said calmly: "At least my mission failed." I gambled that the mainland magic parliament came out young and powerful. The magician must have made a good achievement in the arcane, and certainly can't resist to witness the experiment of subverting the basic theory of the dead spirit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe extended his left hand out of his pocket, four fingers bent in turn, clenched into fists, and his tone became firm: "Okay, Professor, let's make this bet." Let's make an appointment. We are now signing the devil's contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the contents of the book "Astrology and Elements", the magic contract is a document that seeks notarization for various powerful existences. Once the violation is violated, it will be punished by the notary. According to the strength of the notary, there is a contract of magic power directly embedded in the instrument, which is the common magic contract that binds the common mage; the devil's contract with the demon's notarization, according to the summoned devil level Different, it can be used to constrain middle-level magicians, high-level magicians and great mages; the contracts and vows of legends seem to be witnessed by the "original" of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that Mr. Felipe, you believe in yourself, so you don't have to sign a devil's contract." Lucien's tone replied with trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, his level has no way to summon the devil, even if it is summoned by Felipe, when the contract is signed, the devil will find the real level, even though The devil will not necessarily be exposed, but the feeling of falling into the hands of others is always very poor, so Lucien simply asks not to establish a contract, creating a mysterious image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe really stunned, if the professor wants to start, he can now shoot, there is no need to experiment and then repent, what is the professor thinking? ! Or does he not want the summoned devil to know his identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't follow the promise, I believe that Viscount Kareldia will not welcome such a guest." Lucien pointed to a look forward to experimentation. The viscount of Kareldia who began to look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia did not expect that he would be affected by standing. The self-proclaimed professor should not want to leave a real name on the devil's contract, so he laughed. "Two gentlemen, it’s better for me to testify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe nodded slightly: "Then it will be witnessed by the Viscount. Mr. Professor, you start Let's carry out the refining experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien puts his hand on the wave: "For the sake of fairness, let me explain how to do it, and Mr. Felipe will do it yourself, lest After you failed, you made an excuse to say that I was doing something when I was doing the experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very reasonable proposal." Felipe could not help but preach, on the one hand this To make the experiment more credible, on the other hand, you may also be exposed to the details of the arcane experiment with subversion and explosive power, and learn a lot from the knowledge. As for the things that made the experiment fail, Felipe never thought about it, because then it would not be possible to verify whether the experiment was effective. I believe that the professor thinks so, and then makes such reasonable and reasonable suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After telling Felipe about the high temperature and high pressure requirements of the experimental alchemy array, Lucien watched quietly as he took out a fist-sized dark gold house from his pocket and took out many small alchemy devices from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical thing is that as soon as these alchemy devices left the hut, they quickly became the original size under the embarrassment of Felipe, and soon the high platforms were arranged A nice little magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that Lucien is very envious, I don’t know how to get this kind of alchemy items that can be stored and carried around, it’s just a good home travel meditation experiment. helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Felipe placed the Magic Lab, the following wizards and apprentices began to whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said, can Mr. Professor really refine the material of life?" "Fatty" is half-resisting and hesitating to look forward to asking people around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall and thin "red wine" shook his head without hesitation: "How is it possible? Human life mechanics is one of the basic theories of Necromancer established by many ancient legendary magicians." "The truth is no doubt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is no doubt about the truth!" An official Necromancer in front of them turned back and solemnly nodded. "Our success in human refining is the best evidence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fatty" looked at them and whispered: "But Professor lost. If we want to join the pale hand, I really want to go directly to the church to become a night watchman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bread" lowers the sound, gnashing the teeth "Maybe Professor Mr. is trying to slap Felipe when he is doing the experiment, so Felipe will not react!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very very familiar with Felipe Hate, even "Mr." is not called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really mean..." Another apprentice, "The Spot", glanced at him. "But I like it!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former necromancer shook his head and sneered: "Do you think that Mr. Felipe will be unprepared, do you think that the Viscount of Karendia, who is notarized, looks like this?"<br />< Brd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidney on the high platform watched Felipe busy setting up the lab without any expression: "What exactly does Mr. Professor want to do?" He didn't think that the professor The experiment will be successful, perhaps with another purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, I have to seriously consider the things of the pale hand." Tess couldn't see the clues, and the professor also thought that there was no chance of success, so he began to think. How to seek greater benefits in the "Pale Hand". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cearsey saw Sidney’s eyes stunned and shook his head stiffly: “I have decided to go to the pale hand, can Mr. Professor succeed in my relationship with me? Of course, in my own opinion, human life mechanics is a well-deserved truth, not a professor can overthrow it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidney heard their answer, silence After a while, I nodded and nodded: "I should also consider the things of the pale hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mosquitoes flew like a comment, Felipe arranged Well, the magic lab, black with crazy eyes, looked at Lucien: "Mr. Professor, please start to explain how to experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recalls I took a look at the "Arcane" I saw, and confirmed that the meaning of the symbol table in the appendix was not mistaken, and then said: "Separate nitrogen and hydrogen, and store separately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien This is the preparation of urea by industrial process, which is the first artificial combination on earth. Out of the organic matter. The reason why it is not synthesized or used in laboratory methods is because the name of some substances in the reaction formula does not find the corresponding symbol and title of the world. If it is indicated by the description to Felipe, it is easy to reveal. After all, a strong person in the field of elemental magic cannot possibly know the name of a similar substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the industrial system is simple, several substances are very common, and I have seen it in the content and symbol table of the Arcane Journal. High temperature and high pressure conditions that are difficult to reach in Earth's 19th century laboratories are not difficult to achieve in this magical world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
