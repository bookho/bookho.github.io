			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the northern provinces near the ice sheet, the weather in the harvest month has turned cold, but today is a rare day. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哒哒哒, a team of cavalry galloped past the wilderness, the sun was shining on their black armor, and the sign of the Scarlet Bear was dyed. A layer of golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to be searching for something, but they turn a blind eye to the mercenary team not far away, just as they are transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember that group invisibility is a seven-ring spell?" There is a gentleman in this team who is the least like a mercenary. He wears a bright red dress. Lazily leaning against the horse, there is still a glass of red wine in his hand, for fear that others do not know that he is noble and elegant "noble". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the question of Viscount Kareldia, Katrina abruptly and proudly replied: "The study of light runs through the entire history of the parliament. Therefore, we have a very deep understanding of invisibility, and there is no significant difference between single invisibility and multi-person invisibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this is only invisible Part of the principle, but creating a five-ring magic with a partial group invisible effect is not a difficult thing. In fact, Mr. Viscount has never seen you just because this magic can only survive ordinary knights."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes, I admire the Arcanist. You always seem to have a strong desire to explore and maintain a strong driving force, so you don't feel bored, not like us. Some of the guys who are moldy in the old castles often feel that life is boring and they don’t feel anything. There is no difference between living and being dead.” Viscount Kareldia took a sip of wine and pretended a literary youth. Depressed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina grinned with a grin: "Mr. Viscount, isn’t the vampire a dead spirit? What did you think that you are still alive?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also..." Viscount Kareldia faced a woman who grew up under the influence of "The Voice of Mystery" and Lucien. The feeling of righteousness. Anna, next to Anna, looked at the two smilingly, and was delighted to discover the powerful mysterious magician Katrina and the handsome and powerful vampire Viscount Karen Diadia. Still have a normal person's side, not as arrogant and gloomy as he fears, looking down on all the weak creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cavalry went away, Katrina turned to look at Anna and Yakov and others: "Do you think about where to go?"<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> Also worried about being secretly retaliated—how can the church always protect their status? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after the event, they seized the time difference and found the family to pretend that they had died at the scene of the "killing feast", followed by Katrina and Viscount Kareldia left the city of Calcutt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Katrina, you left the sign of the magic parliamentary investigator in the manor, I believe that Count Cargat will not pay too much attention to our situation, as long as Staying in the northern provinces, going everywhere, so you will choose a relatively skilled place." After escaping the death crisis, Anna is no longer so worried about this level of danger, optimistic and open-minded, "you, you Is it going to return to the Magic Council?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They who grew up in the Shahran Empire are far from reaching the true state of the world, except for a brief collaboration with the official magician. After Yakov, the rest of the mercenaries had never heard of the Magic Council, Allinge and other terms before Katrina introduced himself. They only knew the Kingdom of Holm - it is famous for its specialties such as cloth, unique jewellery and ore. The mercenary team often needs to protect the merchants who smuggle these goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Katrina has become a high-ranking magician, but when he heard Anna’s question, Yakov and others couldn’t help but look at it. She is looking forward to being able to work together for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have other tasks in my body and I will not return to Allinge in a short time. In fact, you can go to the Kingdom of Holm, where you are relatively free. There is no shortage of opportunities for exercise. You go north to the ice field, and then go east. After crossing a few defensive fortresses, you can reach the east exile. When you get there, it is easier to go to the Holm kingdom. It's easy, especially Yakov, you are a knight." Katrina sincerely suggested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have similar thoughts with Anna. Rest assured, I am a knight. No nobleman will reject a knight's allegiance. This is not a country in the South that has not experienced war for two or three hundred years." Yakov was silent. After that, I replied firmly, maybe one day I will go to Allinge, but I hope that I have the strength of a five-level knight at that time and can look at Katrina equally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina didn’t say much, just reminded Anna and Yakov with a message: “It’s best to be separated from the mercenaries who have been betrayed, such as Huck. Let them know your true destinations, lest they betray you again in exchange for the property that Earl of Cartart rewards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has no murderous viciousness, But the arcane master should have some caution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good." Yakov and Anna were a little unacceptable for this proposal. After thinking about the encounter in the cell and the altar, they finally nodded. - For many years of mercenary life, they are also used to death and killing, not so simple emotional use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of magic, the team quickly reached the ice field in the north, and Anna reluctantly pulled Katrina’s hand, and her eyes showed a faint wave of light: "Sister Katrina, I will go to the Kingdom of Holm to see you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am always welcome, if possible, I may still Back to the empire, at the time, I will let you return home without worry.” Katrina’s voice has also become soft, in the absence of electromagnetic communication, telegraph, landline, postal service, messenger of the Shahran Empire, in Jacob If husband and Anna have not found a suitable city, this is a farewell, perhaps a farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Katrina has a deeper recognition of the teacher's significance in popularizing alchemy items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the farewell, Anna suddenly remembered something and whispered: "Sister Katrina, is the starry sky you summoned is not the power of legend? Your teacher ? Father? Or..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s my teacher’s atomic control of the lord’s half-plane 'atomic universe’, he is a great arcian, legendary magician Katrina acknowledged broadly that the teacher was not able to show up. On the contrary, she was very proud and proud of the students who could become teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary magician! Sure enough, has it reached the level of a blazing angel?" Anna was shocked and curious, what the Arcanist was, she did not I know, she doesn't know who the "atomic control" is, but no one dares to despise the legendary magician. The ruler of the northern province is a female legendary magician "Ice Snow Queen" Fatia, so there is everywhere here. Her magical stories are left behind, and exaggeration will make people think that the legendary magician is only a little worse than the true god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina is good at the magic of ice and snow, in addition to the influence of the teacher, but also grew up listening to the horror story of the magician, and this " The Queen of Ice and Snow disappeared from the northern province shortly after the fall of the magical empire. No one knows that she is still alive, whether she is hiding in the depths of the dark mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Angel..." Katrina smiled, no positive answer, but in her heart, the strength of the teacher must be stronger than the ordinary blazing angel, only A little worse than the "King of Angels". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After meeting the curiosity of Anna and Yakov, they set foot on the ice sheet, and the Viscount Kareldia laughed and said: "Evans is in the Shahran Empire. It is not famous enough. If you quote the 'Observer', 'The Ear of Silver Eyes', and the Viscount of Rhein Karendia, I believe they will be even more shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is because Rhein is also on the execution list of the Northern Church, and Lucien, who has grown rapidly and has not dealt with the Northern Church, has not been “wanted”—the Northern Church knows its own strength, unlike the South. The church has included all the high-level forces of hostile forces in the purification sequence, and only selected those who have “sinned” in their own jurisdiction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Northern Church's execution list is not authoritative, or it is more recognized by the purification sequence..." Katrina an arcane study tone, against magic For the teacher, the purification sequence is a glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the couple talked a few words, the Viscount Kareldia said that the smile converges and is authentic: "I always feel that there is no demon worship event." Little mystery, the truth may not be what we guessed, maybe Viscount Andre is also a pawn..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
