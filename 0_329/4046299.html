			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When musicians face this different symphony, it is inevitable to subconsciously reject and find its rebellious rough side, but the author of this piece is Lucien? Evans, one of the most famous top musicians, is a genius known for his transformation and creation, so they all have deep respect, even if there is a sense of resentment and discomfort in their hearts, they are serious and focused. Listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, most of the non-Aalto native musicians were infected by the passionate wave, the intense melody, as if returning to the first Aalto Time to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a busy, fast-paced life, going around every day, doing heavy and unstoppable things in order to be hired by a orchestra or hold a small concert. . In his spare time, he is desperate to put in music, or he has to think about the melody like a hair, or to practice repeatedly with his hands and pain. The heavy weight of reality has already made them breathless, and only in the atmosphere of music can you get a peace of mind! Then, they heard a new melody that is different from the familiar music styles. . This shows a brand new "music world", which gives them an indescribable shock, just like when they came to Aalto from their hometown, in the heavy and busy life, they suddenly came into contact with Aalto's music, which was with the hometown music. Different styles allowed them to broaden their horizons and re-recognize music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher’s brow slowly flattens and recalls a lot of past events. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my dream of music, I left my home town, half-traveled and half-played to Arto, but Aalto is so prosperous, musicians, musicians are So many, no extraordinary talents and superb performance skills, it is difficult to live and live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in order to maintain his life, he had to act as a street performer, relying on the little gifts of passers-by after playing the music to fill his stomach, and at night, he went crazy The same is true of Aalto's music creation concept, which is completely different from the hometown town. The money used for saving and eating is also invested in the bottomless pit of learning texts and borrowing books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this busy, fast-paced life, chances, I met Mr. Lessing, who opened a new door to himself. , leading to the rigorous structure of the symphony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I was extremely shocked, just like when I came to a new country, I saw all kinds of different travelers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The music of Lucien shows his experience perfectly - after overcoming many hardships, he traveled to a new country and heard new music. And thus become enthusiastic." Christopher abandoned the stubbornness and prejudice that had arisen before, and gave a pertinent evaluation in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow-up, the whole band played a passionate, turbulent melody like the wave, and then the two sub-themes were presented in turn. They were played by flute, oboe and flute, and they brought a touch of melancholy and sentimentality, which showed the embarrassment of Christopher and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the structural innovations made the musicians feel different, until the end of the first movement, they found that the arrangement of the reproduction department was unique. After several twists and delays in the drama family name, it really started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the nobility in the Hall of the Holy Land and the ordinary citizens on the Plaza Mayor do not have the high demands of the musicians for structural rigor. Although they also think that this symphony is different from what they have heard in the past, even as a music capital, there are many senior fans who can tell where the irregularities are, but they all agree that this is a good one. Works of the above standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They simply listen with their ears and listen with their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short interval, Lucien lifted the baton again, while his eyes closed slightly, as if he was intoxicated with music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody is far away, the color is bleak, and the band plays a few mysterious chords in the bass area, rendering a mysterious and gloomy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an environment, Lucien’s inner feelings of brewing for a long time become a picture into the heart. They are the homesickness of the heart, and they are the thoughts of the scene:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These deep and intense emotions became invisible notes, and as Lucian’s baton slowly flowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mid-range oboe blew a melodious and wide melody, with a deep melancholy sorrow and a sweet, lightning-like sigh In the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher is a bit embarrassed and seems to have returned to his hometown. Is the dark two-story building of the ancient magical empire style still intact, is there any haunted legend? Is the river that has been halfway around the wall still so clear, so sweet? Is the apple tree at the door of the old house still sampling, is it sour as a memory more than fifty years ago? Is the girl who secretly admired herself like her own hair and teeth loose, is she still smiling like she used to? Whether the tombs of the ancestors in the cemetery grew up in the grass, and there are no family children to go to clean... This desolate and melodious melody seems to have smoothed out the long time of more than 50 years, so that Christopher missed his hometown as never before, and missed it very much. I miss my heart and I am full of hearts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty, Joanna, and Simon are also lost in the music they mourn, remembering the ubiquitous mountains of the Djibouti Principality, the rugged roads, scaring people The legend of the Necromancer and the vampire reminds me of my childhood playmates, the taste of my hometown, the warmth and sweetness of my parents, and the old house that symbolizes these riddled holes... Thinking about it, Betty and Joanna's eyes were red, and she left the crystal tears unconsciously, and suddenly she had a strong desire to go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the rich feeling that you can feel from your home! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel and Eliza remembered the southern town, remembered the balcony that carried their love story, and remembered a stone and a tree that they were familiar with and did not know how to cherish. . The blue moss on the corner seems to be vivid, and the delicious hometown specialty seems to be reminiscent of the dream last night... Grace is "seeing" to Stourke, seeing different styles of stone arches and seeing it. A glimpse of the boat, I saw a wax figure that looks like a human figure, and I saw the gradually growing parents and the tired brother.........The melody is melodious, like a cry, whether it is a nobleman, a musician, or Merchants, ordinary people, as long as they have had similar experiences, they can't get into the atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people shed tears silently, I don’t know how many people have a strong homesickness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful atmosphere is gradually interrupted by the idyllic scenery, and then the eager and eager first theme pulls everyone back from the memories - midnight dreams Still alone, no family, no real life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspeakable desolation and sorrow accompanied by the return of the melancholy melody, ended in the violin's affectionate humming and the very light and faint chords that followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without applause, there is only a crowd of quiet, lonely, silent tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next third movement suddenly burst into a vigorous energy, showing the dance genre, the melody and the bright sunshine, let everyone feel the new again The scenery and beauty of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth movement is huge and magnificent, and the excitement of the singer is to reproduce all the themes presented in the previous ones, with ample power and a strong desire to go home. And the imaginary joy scene, like a rushing forward, steadily rushed to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new kingdom is getting farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strong emotional torrent resonates with countless listeners, allowing them to cry from silence to eruption, from quiet listening to tsunami-like applause. Make a huge cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of applause that seemed unwilling to stop in the Plaza Mayor, ringing in the Hall of the Holy Ghost, made Lucien pay tribute over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many nobles, citizens, and most of the businessmen’s expressions are distorted, tears are everywhere, and their hands are applauded without pain. It seems that they have placed their hometown on Lucien. The desire to miss and return! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher’s expression is quiet, full of nostalgia, and softly to Othello, Victor and Natasha: “Tomorrow, I am going to go home and see.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, he added: "This is the most moving slow-motion movement in all the symphonies I have heard, and I have forgotten to pay attention to the whole The structure of the symphony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
