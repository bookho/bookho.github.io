			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The road to 'not dead' is presented to us. If the 'experiment' goes well, we will break through the limits of human life..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the experiment, I stumbled upon a strange and interesting world, full of undead creatures everywhere, chaotically reflecting everything in the main material world, except life ...... After several explorations, I found a group of palaces in the depths of the dead spirits. It was guarded by more than three legendary legends of the magical empire. Fortunately, most of them have no intelligence, so I can sneak into it. I saw the 'curtain' that reveals the most essential mystery of the soul, or it can also be called 'the fireplace'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...When studying the soul curtain An ancient mummies wearing a golden crown found me. Its defense is extremely **. I couldn’t get out of it for a while. I could only hide into the gray ramp after the soul curtain. On the other side of the entrance, I dare not approach. Because it gives me extreme danger Feeling, and believing in one's hunch is the fundamental that a prophet can survive..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is simply a 'door world', gray The halls and black gates seem to be endless. Fortunately, behind some of the gates are all kinds of wonderful worlds. There are strange monsters and precious materials..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "...I found some familiar and unfamiliar magic patterns, and a world that I can't believe. How can it exist here, I can't dream of dreaming... My research and experiments have made progress in breaking through the surname. But here more and more give me a dangerous hunch, maybe I should find a few old friends to explore together, the ancient mummies outside should also be relaxed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "... After a long period of communication, eight old friends, such as Viken, MacLeod, Solins, Albert, Elois, and Eugenia, understood the preciousness of the dead world and joined me. Organized adventure team, Wilfrid has something to do, can't go, can only wait Waiting for the next time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The nine of us are from different empires, and the strength gathered together is equivalent to one-third of the entire magic society. But before I left, I had a strong uneasiness, so I used the mirror of fate to divination once and saw my possible destiny and 'unbelievers between light and darkness'..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous content is similar to the notes that Lucien saw in the big cross star lock, but more detailed, making up for many of the details, and let Lucien understand that it was dead at the time. There are nine legendary magicians in the spiritual world, five of which are legendary third-order, and four of them are legendary second-order. The number may not reach one-third of the total number of legendary magicians at that time. It is more than enough to use the strength to count. It is no wonder that their disappearance has caused the three magic empire to fall into disintegration. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nine legendary magicians are missing here, the 'world of the door' is a terrible place." Rhein and Lucien are close together, one side Watching the door and watching the notes, "But the overall strength is not as good as your adventure team, the existence of the legendary peak, even if calculated by the entire history of magic, no more than ten."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly, did not speak, continued to look at the magic notes, while grasping the time to crack the crown of the ancient mummies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third in the world of the door, we found some strange ghost creatures, which are very similar to our experimental results. If not, we are almost impossible. Discover them, I believe that their research will help us to make further breakthroughs in our experiments..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth in the world of the door, Wicken found Some remnants, some people have come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the 'immortal chamber' mentioned in the legacy items is determined to be at the entrance of the Unreal Corrugated Package, because Only there is the characteristics of the description, the secret of immortality, I don’t think we will be exposed to the secret of immortality! Before I just wanted to break through the limitations of life, in some sense, not dead! Viken, MacLeod, Eugenia The three less-smiling guys are also excited and incoherent, not to mention other people! And the owner of the legacy has gone to the immortal chamber, really achieved immortality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This discovery makes us feel at ease It is difficult to calm down and experiment, and decided to try to explore the immortal chamber first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ninth in the world of the door, the martyr to the immortal chamber is our imagination Beyond the force, we watched as Solins and Eugenia broke down and disappeared. They had gone through many dangers, but they died so badly... No! We are not willing! They are dead. It must also be full of annoyed and unwilling emotions, and may require special measures to pass the martyrdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tenth in the world of the door, we calm down to study the legacy, and once again consumed a 'mirror of fate', finally found the hidden huge laboratory..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before we are advanced, we first study strange ghost creatures. The first thing to look for into the 'immortal chamber' is the Lord Tanos!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xi'an fingers couldn't help but beat. "Sun King" Tanos was the most prominent figure in the late period of the ancient magical empire. Even the 'dead world' and 'immortal chamber' were the first to be discovered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the title of the most powerful magician in the history of the stars, with the closest appreciative of the gods, but at the peak of his life, he has fallen, let the readers Every time I sigh, I sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history books, the fall of the "Sun King" is called the symbol of the magic society from prosperity to decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original Sun King is not a fallen, but it is also missing here. The ancient Hillanas magical empire should be to stabilize the people and declare it to be experimental. Fallen." Lucian has a strange satisfaction that has broken the historical mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sun King Tanos is missing here... Suddenly, this sentence crossed the road of Lucien like lightning, before the familiarity It became a crazy tide that washed the gates of memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Sun's 'Devil' experiment!" The person who is projected by the devil in his heart will gain more than his own strength! In this case, the improvement brought by this kind of projection may exceed several orders. In high-order, there are often only two levels, one level, or even half level improvement. The legendary field should be similar! No wonder I think 'monster' It’s so familiar to the situation that the target character is exactly one order higher!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s just that the 'Devil’ projection is in your heart, and the growth is your own strength,’ There is an external real monster in the world, so I didn’t associate it for a while!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein noticed the vibration of Lucien, asked : "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the soul connection, Lucien tells his own guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein converges with a smile and a leisurely expression, thinking: "The seven ancient devils, I have explored the ancient ruins of the deepest part of hell, in retrospect, it is This monster is quite similar, and it can't reach the level of the gods. It is hard to be destroyed. It also has the ability to spy on the soul and memory. However, this monster does not affect our mind and surname, nor does it 'enhance' our strength. , but strangely stripped the two, with the difference between the essential names."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it can't be projected into the hearts of the legendary powerhouse, only outside From this point of view, I can understand why the scraps of the legendary magician will be so desperate and so mad, so hysterical, because they are gradually affected by monsters in the case of poor strength, invaded The soul, the family name has been distorted." Lucian continued to speculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland nodded: "It makes sense, but why doesn't it destroy the notes and the fragments, why are we so easy to find the legacy?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the question before Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Making a sense of panic?" Lucien frowned. "Continue to take notes and perhaps completely solve this mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eleventh in the world of the door, according to Viken's proposal, everyone deletes all the records in this magical notebook about this laboratory, leaving no negligence. Maybe, I can only access the materials when I go to the lab. I agree with it. I deleted some of the things I recorded before. I can only skip some things in the future. Finally, allow me to pay tribute to Lord Tanos. Although he failed, he illumined the way we marched. He was worthy of the name of the greatest magician. His fall was the biggest loss in the history of magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" The fifteenth in the world of the door, we collected strange ghosts, began to create media according to the method of Lord Tanos, explore the way of acting on itself, and thus convert the 'state' into the 'immortal chamber'... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the twenty-sixth hexagram in the world of the door, the experiment seems to have gone wrong. The 'media' created has become a horrible devil! The ghost in the world of the door! We teamed up to fight it back..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
