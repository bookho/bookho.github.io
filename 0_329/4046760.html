			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Harold’s report, the great elder Augustus continued his prayers. If it was not particularly important, he would never play halfway. Defend the tribute to "the god of steam", "the master of life and death", and "the dazzling morning star". .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Augustus stood up agilely, rubbing his eyes with his right hand: "Steam is supreme!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scene of the "Atlantis" of the Kingdom of God, which he saw after he witnessed the "Eternal Blazing Sun" explosion in Rentt City. The logo of the design is called the prayer movement, just like the "up and down cross" of the truth god! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dwarf Kingdom?" Augustus completely ended his prayer and asked with a little doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is ruddy, healthy, wearing special-made silver armor, and the various components are connected by complex mechanical techniques, full of sophisticated and mechanically cool. Aesthetics - this is also his "Voice of the Gods" archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of the dwarf family, Augustus is the honorary director of many alchemy workshops, there is no hard work to do, and the misery of the night plateau In sharp contrast, it made him very grateful, and spent most of his time on the god of propaganda and praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because life in Rentart City is not closed, Augustus also knows about the situation on the entire continent, knowing that the dwarves who survived are currently gathering in the dark In the northwestern part of the mountain, a kingdom called "Dumte" was re-established. In the language of the dwarfs, "Dumte" means "glory", but they believe in "the god of heroism" Okun And "the god of craftsmen" Hite, not "the god of steam", "the master of life and death", "can not directly call the name of the great existence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after hearing the dwarf kingdom came to the messenger of the "Steam of the Sun", Augustus would inevitably emerge doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold scratched his head: "I also feel very weird, the Lord has never lowered the gods, let us go to the Kingdom of Dum, they are not The great Lord..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, but it’s about the Lord. He has to be careful and he doesn’t dare to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus has sorted out the armor and picked up the steam giant hammer: "Take him to see me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold turned and went out, not long after he came in with a dwarf wearing a leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf’s face has a golden beard that marks the surname, making it impossible to judge his age from his appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His manners and words are quite polite: "Respected tribe elders, I am Ham of the Kingdom of Dum, a great service The Temple Warrior of the God of Steam, who got the god of the Lord some time ago, came to the city of Rentat to connect with you and let you truly enter the embrace of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The God of Steam?" Augustus expressed his doubts in a half-truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamzhuang solemnly nodded: "Yes, just a while ago, the great Lord Hite announced his true identity. It turned out that He is not just a craftsman. The god, and the god of steam that cares about our dwarves for generations, only because of the purpose of sleeping and testing, let the avatar walk on the earth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked and talked about what happened in the dwarf kingdom: "...the twilight of God is coming, so the Lord wakes up from sleep and returns, and you are freed from the night plateau..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of craftsman..." Augustus meditated on the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he and Harold have no obvious resistance to look, Hamm solemnly said: "The Lord wants you to spread His glory in the Kingdom of Holm, let Everyone in the world praises his name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said as he took out a dwarf statue from the storage bag - it had a hammer and had to send it. All are Zhang, and there is a faint glimmer of fire around the body, giving a feeling of sacredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a "saint warrior" and is biased towards the "pseudo-president" of the melee fighting, so he can cast the "God of grace" spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God..." Harold and Augustus all have inexplicable brilliance in their eyes, and the god of steam has never given them magic. The biggest troubles and worries in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing their appearance, Hamm laughed and gave the statue and the ceremony book to Augustus: "We will not divide it in the future." The prayers of each other!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Ham, Harold went back again and looked at the dazed Augustus: "The Great Elder "Do you believe what he said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe." Augustus looked slightly gloomy. "We were taken care of by the great god of steam from the night. The dwarf who left the plateau is his Dai. Even if there is a god, it is impossible for the foreign dwarf to tell us. The Lord will definitely give us orders directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This thing made him feel that his position of the elders was threatened. He was never the image of the spokesperson of the god of steam. He did not receive the gods, but he had to wait for an ordinary samurai dwarf to inform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after a brief thought, he firmly rejected the possibility that the god of craftsmen is the embodiment of the god of steam, unless the Lord directly said to himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you do this, you will not have any vacillation and fully express your piety - if you rely on words and magic to give you a great steam God, all the false gods are dazzling morning stars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold also had a similar idea, but not so determined: "that magic..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If the god of steam does not always give himself the dwarf magic, the rest of the tribe will certainly be drawn a part, and he himself is full of yearning for the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Secretary? Ordinary magic can compare with Atlantis compared to eternal blaze? Can be compared with our usual bursting guns Compared with?? Augustus is also very excited about the magic, but it does not reveal a little bit of comfort. "The god before the Lord is to let us build Atlantis on the ground, and the development of Rentat is just right for us to see. The kind of scene that I came to was moving in that direction. As for Dumt, I believe that you also know through the information that everything there is very backward and contrary to Atlantis!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When we can make eternal blazing weapons, what is the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold focused on nod: " Life in Rentat is the life I have always dreamed of, and I feel that every effort makes me closer to Atlantis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to have magic It's even better! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder, then we?" His gaze looked at where Hamm left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus shook his head: "We wait for the gods and don't recognize Hamm, but we can't rush to deal with him. If this is the test of the Lord." We think of ways to keep him from touching other dwarves..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can be done..." Harold said with distress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pushing the secret door to the core of the Sky City, Lucien walked inside with the teacher Fernando, ready to observe the operation of the fission reactor and found Possible hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It is unreasonable to introduce consciousness into the micro-domain. The observer effect is more likely to be the response of the measurement action, and not as subjective as you describe it." In a quiet passage, Fernando once again mentioned Lucien's interpretation of microscopic particles. "The assumptions that are not based on mathematics are empty talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Convinced of this view, but because of the current limitations of mathematical foundation, he can not find a good interpretation for the time to refute Lucien, otherwise he has long roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "But no matter what interpretation, you have to reserve a position for magic. I think the mystery of magic must exist in the microscopic field." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
