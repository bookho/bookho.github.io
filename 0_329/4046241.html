			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several channels of turnaround and the psychological preparations of the past two experiments, the members of the Cardinal Mission are not too surprised by the overthrow of human life mechanics, angry It was the sign that the Magic Council did not stop, and did not hesitate to continue to move toward the restricted area of ​​the "God of Life". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural formation of the source of life makes these powerful priests and epic knights in their hearts doubt the true name given by the god of life. The Magic Council used experiments to indisputably confirm the possibility of life in the natural environment, which is no longer just a restricted area of ​​the gods! The swaying feedback of faith to the surface is endless anger, because only anger and purification can wash away the guilty conscience of the sacred "Holy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past few hundred years of the Pope’s constant introduction of the Arcane Principles to transform the magic, and to be a member of the Cardinal Mission, have a profound knowledge and good in this regard. Insights, even if you go to the Magic Council, you can have a level of middle-level arcane masters in a year or two, so when they are angry, countless ideas come to mind and use all wisdom to think about the loopholes in the experiment of the Magic Council. As long as you can find one, you can think of it as an error, and let the crumbling God of Life give it a stern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before the Pope’s speech, the Daguangming Hall is like the market area of ​​the holy city of Reims, which is noisy and noisy:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This experiment is only a simulation of the legendary natural environment, and cannot be equated with the environment in which the God of Truth created the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the Holy Scriptures It is also described as lightning thunder, flooding, volcanic eruption...""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Scriptures describe only the environment, the gas composition at that time is likely to experiment with The difference in design, have you not noticed? There is no oxygen that the Magic Council claims to be the most effective for the human body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it does not prove the gas composition at the time The experimental design is different........."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should we prove that we only need to emphasize their mistakes if they can't get another experiment to prove the same, pastor The beliefs that the bishops are shaking can be stabilized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These discussions With the Pope directly but make a point of a new full compliance "canon" and common sense and knowledge of the members of the College of Cardinals to quell the anger convergence quietly listening to the Pope's sermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope’s voice is getting more and more harsh:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether the natural environment and gas composition of this experiment is The true original state, it undoubtedly confirms that the source of life can be found in nature in accordance with certain laws, because this is the environment that can actually appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But are you shaken? Do you think that life is not the Lord's gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The body without the soul is the body, the soul without the body can be the Holy Spirit, It is a prayer, a life that exists in other forms. Where is the mystery and essence of life, is it still unclear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is the soul, it is never the flesh. I think that the first pope who wrote The Holy Scriptures failed to clearly express the will of the Lord, which made you doubt the power of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does nature not be the main creation? Is the law in nature not specified by the Lord? Doesn't the source of quality belong to the glory of the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions and explanations clearly established a new "God of Life," to the Cardinal The members calmed down the impetuous and restless inner feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this big event was sent directly from the city of the Holy Grail, Cardinal Sald painted the cross on the chest, the original turbid and dim eyes were exceptionally clear: "All glory Return to the Lord. Your Majesty the Pope asks you to order the true will of the Lord to be passed to the pastor and the bishops, to let them feel the greatness of the Lord and to understand the glory of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When compared to Lucien in the Hall of the Holy Grail, the whole person of Sard became more ordinary and aging, but it seems to be more profound, as if it can absorb the surrounding light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the most important thing for us at present. Cardinals or cardinals in various parishes quickly arrange pastors and bishops to feel the will of the Lord." The Pope does not panic. Not busy, he said, "At the same time, people are transferred to Holm, Colette and other four parishes to help Feili Bell and Baha'u'llah to stabilize their hearts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"The Magic Council just wants us to fight with them in full without being prepared. The northern heresy, the evil gods in the dark mountains, the dark creatures, etc. can cause us serious losses. In this way, although they themselves will pay the most The big price, but without our suppression, the subsequent strength will grow very fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope said calmly, "With the expansion of the strength of the Magic Council, They understand that sooner or later we will have a full-scale war that determines our destiny, so they want us to start at an inappropriate place at an inappropriate time, and defense is far easier than offensive. We serve the Lord, and we must take the Lord’s glory as the direction of action. Instead of personal glory. We have a lot of arrangements inside the Magic Council, which will play a huge role in the near future, so we don't have to be anxious. Of course, we must start preparing now and transfer the attention to the object.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shi Dong, you led your Knights of the Holy Grail to leave the Holy City to the Holm parish, with Feile Bell and their control Augusta, you secretly went to the north to discuss with the northern heresy with the reading of the magical parliament, so that they also demonstrated their determination to defend the glory of the Lord. This task is very difficult and difficult, I hope you can live up to it. The gift of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A command was issued, a member of the Cardinal Mission left, and after the cardinal stationed in the major parishes returned, the entire Guangming There is only one pope left in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down his scepter, the majesty disappeared, and it became like a lonely old man, and he felt the feeling of the next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the research project, then just wait four or five months after the maturity of food crops such as oats, so the Druids who have nothing to do sit on the magic The steam train is ready to return to Stroop Forest. In this trip, their greatest achievement is not to see all kinds of strange but convenient tools in human society, nor to basically achieve the purpose of increasing grain production with alchemicals, but to affirm the greatness of nature and the greatness of life miracles. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, see you in five months, hope that the alchemy materials can be popularized so that farmers will not die because of hunger." Ellerstin Smiled and stretched out from the window and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that the psychology of elves and humans are very strange. When you hate a person, no matter what he does, he feels awkward, but because of some accidents. I feel that this person is good, as long as he does not make too much things, he will feel that his every move is in line with his own intentions. "In fact, from these two days of communication, I found that Mr. Evans is protecting your nature. Still very thoughtful, but like to look at the problem from a human perspective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exsilion next to her turned her head and smiled at the head: "Evans Sir, if you have the chance, you are welcome to visit Stroop Forest. When you experience the perfect integration with nature, you will be more close to nature and more willing to protect it. Of course, there is also the Elf music you like very much." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was inserted in a black double-breasted long dress pocket, one hand gently waved: "His Royal Highness, Princess Royal Highness, five months later See, actually, the book I have accumulated for the eternal tens of thousands of years. . And more interested in knowledge "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" deformation robe "has been repaired, pale hands bear the full cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜,呜,呜, continuous whistle sounds, the magic steam train starts slowly, and when the locals go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other hand was also inserted into the pocket, and Lucien walked to the other side of the platform to meet with the high-level will of Kasdong, and then accidentally discovered a acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"K, are you coming back?" Lucien greeted with a slight surprise. Without K, his own periodic table paper could not be published in the element. "Journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K is not much different from a month ago, still so burly and robust, still wearing a long black dress, still so thick, he scratched his head Road: "I just met Mr. Larry when I came back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the matter in my hometown?" Lucien asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K said gently and frankly: "It has been successfully solved. Actually, it is not difficult. Just take out that I am a magician, my hometown city council. The identity of the parliamentarians can be solved, but my parents encountered the martyrdom of senior officials of the city hall for the first time, and some feared that they would send me a letter through the magic steam train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
