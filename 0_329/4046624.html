			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning two days later, Lucien, who concentrated on the strength in the "Babel Tower", came to the 35th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower early. , opened the door to the meeting room of the highest jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting room is not much different from the other meeting rooms that Lucien has seen. It is also not spacious, with regular cherry wood in the middle. The only special thing about the table is that the surrounding twenty-four chairs are extremely precious. The velvet veneer reveals a luxurious but restrained dark red, and the back is engraved with different patterns to show the identity of each member. There are storms of lightning and dancing, and there are arcs of arcane and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, here." The face always has a ridiculous alchemy master, Claus, pointing to the chair opposite him, he is the earliest The legendary magician, standing behind a blond little girl looks like an alchemist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the past and found that behind the chair was an atomic structure model of electrons surrounding protons and neutrons, just like the infinite reduction of the celestial operating system. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This classic is destined to be a short-lived model..." The heart sighed, Lucien smiled at Klaus and went to his own position. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Claus, you seem to have been here for a long time?" Lucien saw that there were only two of them in the conference room, so he snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus smiled leisurely: "Evans, you are already a great arcian, you don't have to be so polite, call me Claus, I am A person who likes to arrive early, every time I wait for someone else, I feel like I have extra time, I can think about it, I can be quiet and dazed, enjoying this sudden extravagant time, this is a wonderful time. Feeling, don't you think? You came very early?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, thinking of others waiting for me, I will be very anxious, it is difficult to calm down, While I am waiting for someone else, as long as the other party is not late, during the time after arriving in advance, my mood is peaceful, not impatient, my thoughts are infinitely divergent, full of inspiration." Lu Xien also laughs Answering, I can't think of myself and Klaus have a common feeling in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus spread his hand: "So we know life better than them, and we know how to enjoy it. However, for me, the extravagant time is over because As soon as I saw you, I had a lot of questions to discuss with you. The new alchemy exudes the charm that makes me addicted. I am more addicted than all my dolls, golems, and alchemy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's a new alchemy problem, I'm happy to discuss it." Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus knocked on the table, suddenly dropped a metal arm on the ceiling, holding a cup of steaming black tea, respecting the authenticity: "Lord Kraus, you I like the 'earl black tea.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, what do you like to drink, you can tell yourself." Klaus licked the lipstick tea and took care of himself. Said: "At this time, I saw your strict reasoning based on protons, periodic table of elements, relative atomic weight, and equivalent elements. I have no doubt about the existence of neutrons. Its discovery is only a matter of time, but my track and transition to electronics. The process of radiating electromagnetic waves has too many doubts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, Lucien did not have an unexpected Klaus doubt, and asked for a "sky blue": "There are still a lot of problems in this area, we can discuss the research together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smirk that Claus has always had with his face gradually converges:" First, the electronic transition you describe is a quantum process, that is, it When the orbital transitions to another orbit, it does not go through the middle of the road. It flashes directly there. This seems to be a process of space jumping or transmission. Is it the basic theory of our current space magic?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there has been no way to explain the problems of space transfer, jumps, and barriers, space-like spells have evolved very slowly, demandingly high, and inaccessible, even the Southern Church and magical rituals. Organizations, there is no spare capacity to arrange more constant transmission arrays, can only barely establish channels to connect headquarters and capitals. As for all provinces, counties, major cities, they have to rely on the original way, in electromagnetic communication After the initial development of cable telephones and telegraphs, they were improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, it may or may not matter. I have not studied this issue in depth. The transition of energy level is only a preliminary explanation. There may be more in the future. A good theory to describe this problem, we can only step by step to the real, but can not preach that they have been real." Lucian did not expect that Claus is such a high-end problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The question is, why do electrons have orbits, and why there is a 'jump'? Gravity causes the artificial planet to orbit around the world, and the orbit appears. The electromagnetic force will only cause the electrons to eventually crash into the nucleus." The crisp but indifferent sound is at the door. Heather Wei, who is ringing and beautiful, does not know when it will arrive in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former New Alchemy Research Office is constantly bombarding the neutrons or other anomalies. Similar problems, though not, are not mainstream, but The discovery of the neutron, the interpretation of the electronic orbit and the transition, occupied the first place in the minds of the sharp arcane masters and legendary magicians such as Hathaway, and it can be seen that Hathaway has considered this problem for a long time, and the language is smooth. natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien yelled at the brow and replied: "In the microscopic field, perhaps the electromagnetic force is not applicable, and other forces are playing an important role in the orbit. And the transition is a hypothesis for the time being, confirming the truth through the experimental results and the feedback of the observed phenomena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These great arcans, legendary magicians are really enough, one by one The problem is in the middle of the current "new alchemy" atomic internal result model vulnerability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be an electronic or proton, neutron has a guilty surname, this surname caused the emergence of the orbit, rather than impose an orbit on the electron, It is stipulated that it must be so sporty." Hathaway is still not satisfied with Lucine's explanation, and the language is a bit clumsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the model of the new alchemy electronic orbit can only describe a simple structure of electrons, more complex structures of electrons can not be explained, you use the outer layer The theory of exchange to explain the original alchemy reaction is very realistic, but it can't be included in your model." The loud voice came from the door, and the always impetuous storm dominated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien got up and said hello to the teacher, then shook his head and said: "Sorry, this model is still in its infancy and needs more arcanes to perfect. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently daggers and sat down and said: "I always feel that this problem hides deeper mysteries."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four elements and leaders in the field of alchemy have conducted extensive and in-depth discussions on the new alchemy. In this process, "absolute defense" Atumman, "curse of the eye" Atlante, etc. The legendary magicians also arrived one by one, listening to their communication intently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Speaker Douglas entered with a cane, it marked the beginning of the meeting and the discussion of the new alchemy gradually subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the time to ask Hesswei: "Where is the mother-in-law, when can Mr. Ravendi pass the advanced legend?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Lucien tried to contact Ravendi, but none of them succeeded, and Natasha was busy dealing with the House, Cabinet and his own relationship, not knowing the specific situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that Lucien also followed Natasha to call her mother-in-law, Hathaway’s right index finger flicked a little, and the voice became indifferent: “Laven’s I returned to my magic tower, broke all connections with the outside world, concentrated on my knowledge and accumulation, and wanted to thoroughly understand the 'element decomposition' that was resolved before in the shortest time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elemental Decomposition" is the unique magic of Hathaway, not handed over to the parliament, but members of the elemental will can learn by contribution, Lucian also intends to become himself a great arcian and After the legendary magician, the reward of the elemental will is replaced by this magic, and it is used to improve his "order of elements" and turn it into a legendary spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Atom Control" legendary magical career, Lucien is also ready to submit to the parliament and elemental will in exchange for more legendary magic - become a big arcane The teacher has a legendary item reward, and the legendary magician can pick a legendary magic in parliament for free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that Mr. Ravendi can be promoted successfully." Lucien sincerely wished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is "element dominator" or "atomic control", the match with Laven's cognitive world should be high, and the cognitive world For semi-cured, the higher the legendary career match, the greater the hope of promotion. As long as you master the "elemental decomposition", you can try to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaus smiled across the street: "In the future, the highest parliamentary meeting of the parliament will have a scene of the end of the world..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
