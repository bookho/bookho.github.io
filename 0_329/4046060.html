			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Based on feedback, reinstated the activity into double quotes. In addition, thank you, yesterday, I have been to the top ten recommended list in the week, it is really a surprise location, continue to seek referrals, and strive to update a little more tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this shadow is far more than the Baron Laurent, even surpassing the visual limits of ordinary humans, if those who participate in (lead) * flurry The men and women of the meeting calm down and look in this direction, and they will only see a long, blurred black light, which is the afterimage of the extremely fast speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speed is not something that normal people can achieve, only the strong ones who have stimulated the blood power can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This violent attack on Lucien is actually a real knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the black shadow, until he flies to the back of Lucien, the dark dagger will stab the road to Sean, only less than two seconds have passed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected sages, white honey, Smyr, and even have not discovered that there are powerful enemies behind and attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Lucien, when the blackhead with a haze is close to his vest, he suddenly feels a heartfelt shudder And fear, the subconscious rushed out in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the speed of Lucien’s rushing out is not comparable to the speed of the black shadow. This is a huge gap in strength, like the abyss and “paradise”. "the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Lucien can use his knowledge to create new magic that can shock knights, magicians, and magic apprentices, it can’t be transformed when it’s really fighting. The knowledge of strength can't help Lucien's instant magic to block the attack of the dagger. Only become a magician, constructing a spell model with spiritual power in the soul, in this critical moment, after the sudden detection, instant magic withstand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only hope for Lucien is that the power that he throws forward will weaken the attack of the dagger. As long as you don't kill it directly, you can still fight back with the snow and avengers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows are coldly watching the dagger in his hand coming into contact with Lucien’s vest. Suddenly, a screaming sound rang, and Lucien’s body slammed A transparent, chain-like reticle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic, Master Armor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Sage and others did not respond, when the black shadow came out, the black crow "Ashley" on the tree top of the villa was noticed. It is the magical darling of the official magician, not only has his own dark vision, but also borrows the master's magical power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger with black light spurs the transparent Master's armor, a little radiance, and the armor is quickly broken into pieces. , shining in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow did not expect the sudden appearance of the Master's armor, although with the strength of its own and the special dagger, successfully pierced the Master's armor, but slowed down A slow, eye-catching Lu Xien half turned, left hand to himself, is the three crystal clear flashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parmela's Ice Blade", the second ring magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not faint at the crucial moment, no fear, and very calmly inspired the "Avenue of the Snow", knowing that only attack at this time Is the best defense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, under the blessing of the "Avenger of the Snow and the Snow", just like the official knight, it is not crushed by the dark horror of the shadows and the infiltration of the soul. Normally The magic apprentice should have been in the endless shadow of the shadow knight's momentum, staying in place, let him attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cold-blooded, like the ice of a thin ice knife, just appeared, crossed the distance between the two men, and flew The shadow knight's throat, chest, and lower body are three places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He daggers up and picks up his arm, and the two shadows of the ice that are shot at his chest and throat are crushed and turned into countless tiny ice flakes, like fireflies in the night, and right foot kicks. Out, the flame that beats with a shadow, accurately kicked the last ice blade, kicked it and dissolved it in the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blocking the three ice blades, the Shadow Knight’s dagger will continue to pursue Lucien, who has already reached the ground, while his left hand is extended. The black shadow of the layer illuminates, preparing to block the two silver-black missiles ejected from the mouth of the black crow "Ashley". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic, "magic missile"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, it seems that the snow and ice of a small star has turned into a cold fog, and it has shrunk sharply, freezing it into ice. Including the shadow flame on the Shadow Knight, it is covered by crystal ice and quietly burns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Palmera's Ice Blade" can not only make people feel the pain of blood flowing, but also enjoy the "cold embrace of ice and snow"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Knight was briefly frozen in place, hit by two magic missiles directly, breaking the ice and kicking him up. The shadow of the body is constantly shaking, but it is not extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Crow Ashley snorted: "It’s a second-level knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, the sage, white honey and Smyr reacted and saw the dark shadow of the flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know each other’s strength, but just watching Mr. Professor tumbling on the ground, and the other side’s shadow-like flame is burning, knowing that he is definitely The strong who inspired the blood, so the sage and white honey did not think much, directly inspired the magic items on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invisible light of the chest of the sage is like a wave of water spreading toward the front, with a width of ten meters. In this range, all men and women suddenly yawned. The eyelids couldn't stop hanging down, softly fell on the lawn or flowers, and quietly sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic, "sleeping." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow knight who was struggling to control the body to maintain balance, was affected by the light of sleep, and the brain was confused, feeling that the surrounding was a warm and soft bed. Summoning himself to fall asleep, but he is strong, he resists drowsiness, shakes his head, and wakes up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what followed was a majestic wave of waves like a hammer, which hit the Shadow Knight and smashed him. I slammed into the window of the villa and flew directly into the window and flew in. I made a jingle sound and let the villa shake again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ring of magic, "force field wave", the magic of the white honey robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is a second-level knight, not so easy to die, Professor Mr. continues to attack." Black Raven Ashley has already flown to the vicinity, to the mind At least the "Professor" of the Second Ring Magician said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is ready to throw out the blazing rubber and attack with the black crow Ashley, but before the action, the shaking of the whole villa suddenly becomes fierce. The ceiling began to collapse, and the wall began to collapse. In just a few seconds, it collapsed completely and buried the shadow knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, as the sage said, the old house of Baron Laurent was in disrepair..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien knows that the energy of his "resonance hand" cannot shake a normal house, but it has not been repaired for a long time. The shaking just now should have shaken its structure and stability. It was hit by the Shadow Knight again, and it collapsed directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, the sound of the villa is very large, the sage can't have time to apply the silencer barrier to offset, let it spread far and far, clearly visible in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops, the night watchman!" This is the first thought of the black crow Ashley, the Sage, and others. At this time, go look for it again. The collapsed villa, killing the shadow knight, will only wait for the night watchman of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly measured the danger, the black crow Ashley turned into a black shadow, wrapped in white honey, while on the road to the road: "Mr. Professor, See you next time." Flying toward the black night sky, quickly moving away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
