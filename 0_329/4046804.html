			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets of Tate are crowded and lively. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, what is that?" Suddenly, a scream broke out in the crowd, causing the surrounding citizens to look down his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alchemy cars will fly?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also blurted out of the way, only about three-story height, flying a silver-grey thing, like the alchemy car driving on the road, like the same The front, the car, and the door also have wheels and lights. It just looks a lot thinner. It is suspected that it is not a normal metal. Of course, the biggest difference is that this strange "alchemy car" can fly! Isn't this the ability of the magicians and Knights of the Third Ring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud exclamation, more and more citizens are looking in the air. For a while, Rentat has more than a thousand looking up at his head. "statue". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also in Renttat, where other people have been screaming at the monster while fleeing, maybe it will cause Step on the accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ribello Viscount on the "Flying Car" sipped a cigar and looked at the scene below with satisfaction, only to feel that the exclamation of the voice was the most Good praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it worth to be surprised? A group of countrymen." Count Ribeiro smirked softly. "Not constant floating and the power plant of an alchemy car." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the son of a count, who is motivated by the potion, hopeless to fly by himself, and he feels that the flight state of relying on ordinary alchemy items is too ugly. Just like naked to show to others, the nobility should have the auspicious flight "ceremonies", must be calm, must be elegant and noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea has been buried in his heart, but can not be achieved in a proper way until the "Alchemy Car" was invented, he realized that he really wants What, the real aristocrats should drive the "car" of such a appearance. Flying in the air, let the inferior citizens look up but can't see the appearance of the nobles inside. Of course, if it is not the first time, he must have a " The coachman, how can the nobles drive themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he found several magicians who have a strong interest in money and materials, based on the "Alchemy Car", re-selected the metal material to make the weight Reduced, the same · safety crashworthiness is also greatly reduced, and then, based on this, constant floating, so that "alchemy car" can float according to manipulation - constant "flight" is a high-order thing to do At the very least, the mid-level magician can make alchemy items fire several times a day, which is difficult to meet the needs of the Viscount Ribeiro. Finally, they modified the power unit of the Alchemy Car itself so that it can inject gas, allowing the operator to freely change direction, thus They did not use "flight" to make the alchemy car "fly" and can also travel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this kind of "flying car" also has its own flaws. First, floating is not a real flight. It is very slow when going up and down. Second, it consumes energy. Very exaggerated, such as "floating" is said to be constant, but also requires energy supplements such as magical gems, ordinary people can not afford. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, the Viscount Ribeiro is quite satisfied, that is, to make the mud legs, the towns and villages can not afford to "flight cars", in order to highlight the elegance of the nobility And noble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "slow driving" under the fear of colliding with the alchemy car, looking at the faces with horror, the Viscount Ribeiro explored the left hand Played a cigar ash, then spit a cigarette ring, arrogant and satisfied with the authenticity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of countrymen.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; While showing "noble", he stepped on the "energy gate" with excitement, trying to smash through the air passages that were clipped from several tall buildings, so that the group of townships could only look at themselves and flying cars. The back of the cool back!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just passed through the "channel", his eyes suddenly solidified, because the opposite side also flew a car exactly the same as his "baby" There is also a stunned man who is shocked by the expression, the same speed, the same flying height!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the first thing that came to mind in his mind was this idea. Then he "proficiently" pulled up the joystick and tried to continue climbing to avoid possible collisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the biggest problem with "floating" is that the takeoff and landing climbs slowly. It is not the magician who ignored the problem for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two faces of the same horrified face were stunned, and then the two flying cars slammed into each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...··· Should not fly so low for others to see...·····” Ribeiro’s pupil’s pupil contracted sharply, not normal He did not have a strong will to motivate his blood, nor did he remember his "Knightdom strength" at a critical juncture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge fireball broke out in the air, and the wreckage of the alchemy car landed like a raindrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all the people who look up and are completely stunned this time. What is the situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, a group of fiercely burning things fell in front of the black suitcase, scared him to take a few steps, almost stepped on the road Sewer entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A terrible explosion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost in the middle! I..." !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lentage is really dangerous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thought spreads in Ali’s mind He caught up with his dreams and realized the "danger" of Rentatt. At this moment, he suddenly realized that he wanted to achieve something. He would never have no setbacks. It would be smooth sailing. If you are not careful, you may not be surprised. Just let yourself lose your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impetuous emotions in his heart were quickly curbed by this strange encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quick, fast alarm!" The citizens woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are used to the existence of the Holm Police Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atomic universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you laughing at?" Natasha flew back from the outside with a long sword. She just finished the afternoon sword exercise and she witnessed Lucien's strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer directly, but gently sighed: "Someone is staring at me every move.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to the Yuri statue? Natasha was keenly responsive and instantly reminded of this. Lucien letting Katrina put the statue in the Kingdom of Dumte itself has a dual purpose, one of which is temptation!<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien snorted: "If 'he, don't do it, I have to find a way to let Hite discover, now, he jumped out." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you determine who it is? Natasha asked solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "I predicted according to the direction of the incident, so I can't confirm who it is." Knowing that there is such a guy, after all, any means of adding unnecessary magical arrays to the statue is easy to see, which will put Katrina in danger. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has not let the students who have not reached the high level involved in this dangerous idea.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seem to worry too much. Natasha saw Lucien's expression relaxed, and relaxed, slowly put away the sword of truth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alert me, worry about unnecessary Anyone who needs to stare at me and pay attention to my every move to attack the level of the gods has something to worry about? "The two husbands get along, Lu Xien said and started to make a joke. "You see me, they all research on their own and never stare at others. This is the style of the strong." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the strong is the epic knight and I practice swordsmanship! Natasha picked the left eyebrow.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
