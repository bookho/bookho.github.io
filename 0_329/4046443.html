			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucien’s words, Nesika and other gentlemen could forcibly hold back, and Ms. Milina and Marpel smiled. Come out, let you growl and let you growl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky's thesis is a new geometric system that contains a large number of inference propositions that are much longer than ordinary papers and are almost equivalent to a book. Although Lucien explained a lot of places, but roared from start to finish, there was no objection to an arduous battle. Even with the knight's body, the scorpion is difficult to be intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a reasonable inference, but because of the imposing manner of Lucien, the stormy roar shook, Mirina and others completely I didn't think about it in this respect. I subconsciously think that he is a "strong man" like the storm master, and will never worry about being too much. But now, Lucien's bitter smile answers them to make them feel that their "spiritual trauma" has been compensated, and they also begin to think that Lucien is still close to the easy, at least privately, not a strong arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to take care of your medicine?" Milina grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head, his voice was still very light, and he could hear the hidden hoarse: "Nothing, I am a second-level knight, after an hour or two. You can recover on your own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, Nesika sighed: "Evans, you saw Levs for the first time in a few days. Basic papers? I found two ways to prove, especially the second is simple and beautiful, fully demonstrating the compatibility of Levski geometry and tower geometry, so that we can no longer ignore the reasons, no longer There is no way to continue to let arrogance and prejudice blind our eyes. You have an incredible talent in the field of mathematics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is these years The research on differential geometry, surface problems, etc. gives me a solid foundation and inspiration, or even if I can look at Mr. Levski's paper without any prejudice, focus on the paper from pure axiom hypothesis and deductive reasoning. Content, it is impossible to complete the argument so quickly, just like without the help of foundation and magic We can not since the construction of the tower. "Lucien modest one, can not be said to be due to the great mathematicians of you on Earth now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said that according to the previous research progress, there is no way to promote the middle-level Levsky after about four or five years of death, it should be possible to start Facing his essay and proposing the process of proof, what he did was to "return" him to the glory and status at the most appropriate time, rather than waiting for him to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of Lucien, let Minina and others faintly uncomfortable and angry and disappeared, and sincerely apologize again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nesica looked at Levsky, whose mood was gradually stabilizing, while sighing and depressed: "Unfortunately, Levsky’s new geometry, Evans committee member your new geometry, there is no real arcane meaning, there is no way to board the "Arcane" journal. This is a common shortcoming of the arcane division in our mathematical field, hey, only in the tower of the high tower "The journal is published."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a world in which theory must be integrated with reality. The reason why calculus is called the result of changing the era is because It can accurately calculate the complex structure in the spell model, greatly simplifying the construction process of the magicians, and greatly reducing the spiritual requirements, so that the magician who had to be promoted to the middle level in just a few decades or two can be shortened. In five or six years, you can advance, and even some geniuses have created a horror record that took only one year from the official magician to the middle magician. Of course, in the process of exploring the mysteries of the world, calculus is also extremely important. Supporting role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the complex function is the core of the mathematical research in recent decades of parliament because it can describe and calculate the mental field. Every one of it has Value papers have the hope of boarding the "Arcane" and "Magic" journals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the new geometry of Levski and Lucien, although there is already a mathematical model, it seems to have nothing to do with arcane exploration and magic research. It is more like self-entertainment in the field of mathematics. There is no hope of boarding the "Arcane" journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is half jokingly: "Perhaps some aspect of the world presents a new geometric description, rather than an intuitive understanding of the tower geometry. The journal may give us a special supplement to recognize the important role that new geometry plays in the real world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope so." Milina, Marper, Salgueiro and others did not believe in Lucien's jokes, only expressed sincere wishes. Even according to Douglas's theory, the world is a sphere, and Evans geometry has a good effect in spherical research. It has no hope of boarding "Arcane". After all, most magical spheres are effective and can be nearly equivalent. The use of high tower geometry and the surname of the curve is not so complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of mathematics committee members, in addition to the firm parliamentary Rose, are the top of the tower, they can decide the release of the "Star" journal, so slightly After discussing a few words, Milina said to Levski and Lucien: "It is now at the beginning of the month, the "Star" journal has just been released, but in recognition of Levski and Evans, you are in the field of geometry. Outstanding contributions, we hope that your papers will be seen by most arcane masters as soon as possible, so I plan to make a supplement, do you have any opinions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the minds of many arcans, the supplement is not very formal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky has no opinion on this, can pass the review, get such a high evaluation, get so many arcane points, and become a fourth-level Austrian The surgeon, and hopefully won the Arcane Scepter Award, he is quite satisfied, and does not mind the form of the supplement. As far as he is concerned, the paper is faster seen by other arcans, and his new geometry is faster. Being accepted by them is more important. This is one of his ideals: to give real, wide-ranging recognition to the new geometry of "children". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not answer directly, but instead turned to Lucian, what the Evans committee said, what to do. Years of grievances and pains can be rewarded, relying on his help and help in all senses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the word supplement, Lucien suddenly had some thoughts, so she was silent for a short time, and Milina thought he was not willing, and added it quickly. One sentence: "The two papers of both of you are very long. Together, they are equivalent to a thick book. If you release it next month, there will be no space for other papers to be published, so it will still be a supplement, and one will On the "Star", there are only two of your papers. This is the first time after the calculus era. It is a kind of glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smile pendulum I waved my hand: "I don't dislike this glory, but I think of another way. Since there is a supplement, why not add a subsidiary publication of "Star", and put research papers in the field of mathematical science on this? "Astrology" can focus on the papers in the field of astrology, so as to avoid the position of the magical papers such as blessings, prophecies, curses, etc., which are often criticized by the number of theories, and the affiliated publications can also include more papers in the field of mathematical science. drum Arcanists study mathematical knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a complicated process for adding a journal, and it may not be able to include so many papers in the simple mathematical field, initially as a subsidiary publication. , you can bypass a lot of processes, when the paper is not enough, you can also be very thin, do not have to worry about being laughed at, anyway, it is only a subsidiary publication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subsidiary publications, there was no such form in the past, how is its impact factor determined?" Nesika asked somewhat and seriously. He is an authority in the field of mathematics and naturally hopes to have a journal of true mathematics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien explained the form and benefits of the subsidiary publications. Finally, "As a subsidiary publication, the impact factor is of course followed by the main publication and lowered accordingly. Level, "Astrology" is 2.5, this is 2.0."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are very interested in this and will apply to the committee tomorrow. Committee of Evans, column Mr. Fusky, are you willing to put the paper on the subsidiary publication instead of "Astrology"? The influence factor will be less than 0.5, and the quoted Arcane points will be less." After a brief discussion, Milina smiled and agreed. Two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xiping and laughed: "I have no problem, and one of the few papers in the inaugural issue is also a kind of glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky also nodded: "I have no opinion, my new geometry has no specific arcane and magical meaning, and the chances of being cited by research are certainly few. Arcane points can't be lost a few times, it's better to exchange for the inaugural issue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you very much, the first issue of the new issue is these papers, just "Mirina smiled. "Right, Mr. Levsky, I wonder if you can be the editor of this new publication? You are an excellent arcian in the field of mathematics, a brilliant genius."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky has considered it. Compared with other work, the editor-in-chief of a purely mathematical journal is more suitable for himself and has more time to study mathematical knowledge and arcane world. And to enhance the magic power, so he gently beheaded: "Thank you for your invitation, I hope that I can do a new journal. . As "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
