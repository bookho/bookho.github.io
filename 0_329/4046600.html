			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the city of Rentatt, the heat of July does not detract from the beauty of the scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space above the "land of thousands of lakes" suddenly twisted into a door, inside the door is a kingdom of strong magnetic and current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook with a white hair band and "Silver Moon Scholar" Chelsea? Holt walked out of the door and saw the ocean of light that enveloped the whole city. He saw that the legendary battle inside had not subsided, and his heart suddenly relieved and finally caught up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Brooke felt a little, looked up at the sky, and saw a figure in the ocean that blocked the light of the sun slowly emerged, wearing a sacred crown. , holding a platinum scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benedict II! God descends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s pupil slams, Finally, I quickly flew up and greeted the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should have no way to use God's Fall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy light clusters are getting faster and faster under the suction of strong magnetic fields At this time, it is necessary to enter the storm enchantment. At this time, not only Melmos, but also the saints such as Anasta and Mary have an extremely dangerous premonition, as if a heavy stone is in the heart. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t communicate, but they rushed to Fernando at the same time, and must kill him before the horror magic worked, lifting the storm and enchanting, away from the core. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any reservations, the three saints used the "light of judgment", and the heart was extremely angry, that is, death, and also to pull you together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majesty, vastness, order, and light, the three "lights of judgment" with the ruling of all the tempering of the sky, the mighty battle to Fernando, It has become a surging ocean of the Holy Light Ocean in the "land of heaven". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, they are not distracted, only relying on the residual magical effect on the body to withstand the attack of the storm enchantment, can not kill Fernando, other ideas are It is superfluous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Melmos, Anthony blends the power of his "Dawn" and "Brightness" with Jianguang, and displays the "legendary" that the Holy Knight has. Broken!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Fernando did not retreat, ignored the attack of two epic knights, and slammed into three "lights of judgment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror that outlined the complex pattern appeared again, like the door connecting the two worlds, when Dangdang, three crisp sounds, "Judgement The Light" bounced back following the light's reflection theorem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of "steep rotation" has not been lifted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Fernando took the initiative to greet the "light of judgment", the two "smashed the shackles" came to him a little later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jianguang entered the body, flesh and blood, the storm master was divided into three pieces, the body of the magic robe did not play the slightest role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't even wear the robe of the ruler?" Melmos only realized at this time why the storm dominated and did not use it when he was suppressed by himself. Eye of the Storm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he understood it too late! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three corpses shine with small electric light, squirming, and turned into three Fernando! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos, Anthony have no hope that in just a few seconds, the storm can be completely degraded by the light of judgment, they have only one idea, First solve Fernando and break the storm enchantment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of Angels" in the distance, Mekan Tron, sees his face, his face becomes dignified, his hands are crisscrossed in his chest, and he will use his face to display "God's Guardian, so that although I can't beat the legendary magician, but the horrible magic is hard to hurt myself and others, because it is already in a different world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not your Lord, don't yell at me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s voice is heard, and it’s a rare humor. The original goal of his drag is Benedict II, the strongman of the class of gods, has now changed to the "king of angels", not in the mountains of heaven, and naturally relaxed a lot. According to the initial plan four, if the pope is met, it will immediately create the current situation. Even if the Pope can still perform God's Fall, the object must be the material of the group, otherwise it will destroy the five saints together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Douglas didn’t know how long he could drag the Pope, who was desperately rescued, ten seconds, twenty seconds, or one minute? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns, with the smooth progress of the third case, disappeared with Sarder’s unexpectedly “God Drop”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallen Hill’s body light bursts, freezing his own cold and dark blue, but he wisely did not go to the storm to enchant, but toward “Elemental Dominator” Hathaway played “Light of Judgment” and tried to interrupt her spellcasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wall of Aurora!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cold female voice, the crystal clear ice layer appears beside Hathaway, flowing with colorful and beautiful, like the aurora of the North . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light of Judgment is on the top and both are annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter Ice Witches, while maintaining the space shackles outside the "storm enchantment", there is still room to block Warren Hill, this is the Arcanist "Distance" with the general Holy Spirit priest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five saints are already fighting for their strength, and their strength has fully gained the upper hand. In just a few seconds, there has been a "judgment light." "The legendary smashed the shackles" hit the three Fernando, even if he continued to display "magic sorcerer armor", "electromagnetic storm" and other magic, but also failed to completely block, and finally the remaining body is a fair order The cold, ruthless light engulfed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! The five saints had just raised their joy and found that there was no sign of a lifting of the storm enchantment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A puppet with many strange symbols flashed behind them with inexplicable smiles and quickly became Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the "casting material" passed through the storm enchantment, and the ruin of the inside was unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando blasted and merged with the storm enchantment. The black magnetic field compressed and twisted the space, firmly binding the five saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos made an accurate judgment, opened the "Aegis" and waved the "Holy Avenger", as long as it is not a god drop, even if it is A hit at the level of the gods, you may not die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, the four saints also understood their situation, and they were slightly confused in their expressions, "Aegis" and "Sacred House" Wait for the defense to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri finally finished the long mantra, sighing the authenticity:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Eternal blazing yang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, Fernando saw the faces of the five saints being "white" by the brightness of the energy group, and suddenly remembered the way One of the words that Sean said when he joked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cry, call, then die!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bright and dazzling to the extreme light broke out from the energy group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexel Palace, in the House of Nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open-minded and conservative aristocrats who quarreled quietly, not knowing what Her Majesty had to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear to the Lord of Hell with my own soul and destiny:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return the rights to the nobles who follow me, leaving only the royal family’s territory. Financial rights and staffing arrangements!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this? The nobles were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will hand over the judicial and legislative powers to the House of Lords, leaving only the veto, and my future generations will not take back!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will hand over administrative power to the nobility, which will be handled by the Prime Minister’s selection of ministers in the Electoral House’s ten-year election, and will only be reserved for the Prime Minister’s candidates!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will hand over the command of the Knights of the Judgment and the Order of the Knights of the Holy Cross to the Cabinet, retaining only the control of the Knights of the Sword of Truth and the two great knights. The title of the lord of the regiment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The taxation and administrative agencies of the various nobility will not cancel, but you have the right to decide the usefulness of the tax!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aristocrats who lead the kingdom to open up the territory will directly receive one third of the territory as a fief, and the other third will be divided by the Knights, the last three points One belongs to the kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Promises will be included in the Code, and it is clearly stated that I and the future kings and queens will abide by it, no different from the general aristocracy! It is supervised by the Magic Council!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Rumble, as if there is lightning and thunder in the minds of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, due to the external suppression of the powers such as the Church and the Magic Council, they and others must be closely united around the kingship in order to achieve a better living space. However, sometimes, Wang Quan is too overbearing and has reduced the rights of his aristocrats to a minimum. In the face of this situation, I have never expressed objection to the stability, the balance, and the future for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But today, Her Majesty has made concessions herself, greatly weakening the kingship, better than the best situation that the nobles imagined themselves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Duke of James and the Duke of Sorenfen are bright and bright, the muscles on his face are slightly twitching, the emotions in his heart are very excited, and the interests are already large enough to cause Greed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current sound, Natasha’s eloquent speech was in the aristocrats of the Kingdom of Colette, the Kingdom of Burrian, the Principality of Calais, and the coastal corridor of the North. Resound in the House:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I swear to the Lord of Hell with my own soul and destiny:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will return the rights to the nobles who follow me, and only retain the financial and staffing rights of the royal family directly under the territory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Song of Dusk" Youssner stood up from the seat, and the aristocrats around him were equally excited, which outlined a beautiful future scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Calais listened to Natasha’s speech and looked at the reaction of the nobles, with a bitter smile on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Hammer of the Void", "The Knight of the Disaster", "The Reaper of Life", and "The Lady of Burning" also have almost the same reaction as Youssner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Natasha’s speech, Duke of Sorenfen, James The duke and others rose together, but a few extremely conservative aristocrats hesitated under the influence of the Duke of Rex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope's Majesty?" Rex suddenly saw the silhouette of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just wanted to talk, and a loud bang broke out, just like there were countless thunders slamming directly into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sun rising outside, it was so blazing, such horror, dispelling the light, indicating the new life! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
