			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked for success, and he smiled in the bottom of his heart: "The east exile can be called the big man, thirty or forty, want to guess It's not difficult. You can't be the men of the nine city owners. If it's their men, how can they be used to cover up, even the name is not willing to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang, the rapid metal collision sound came from behind the pub, and the secret room seemed to be underground, and several quasi-knights struggled to make the pub floor slightly tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the guests, the guests dispersed outside. They are not afraid of bloody, afraid of killing, afraid to see battles, long-term life and travel to and from the East. They have long been numb and indifferent to this kind of thing. They are worried that the battle of the quasi-chiefs in the secret room will destroy the foundation and let The pub collapsed to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put his hands in his long dress pocket and slowly walked to the pub door. There were many people in the Shahran Empire who were exiled here, and There is no shortage of guides. She and Leo are neither relatives nor friends. I don’t know whether he is offending a lord in the East, because he is doing good or bad things, so there is no need to stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien leaving without hesitation, the leader of a blindfolded man raised his hands with a giant sword, looked at him with a puzzled look, then no mouth He continued to provoke Lu Xien, but turned to cooperate with another swordsman to block the bartender from the bartender and the news. After all, from the previous shot, he can clearly judge that Lucien has the strength of a formal knight, and he may not dare to offend the person behind him, but if he taunts him arrogantly, he will be secretly killed and thrown into the forest. The best end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you live in the East, you don’t have an absolutely tough background, even if you are poisonous, arrogant, and arrogant, in the face of people who are stronger than yourself. I know how to be patient and wait, because those who don’t know how to do this have all become the food of the beasts in the forest and become the material of the Necromancer... This is the rule of naked swords and magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien walked without hesitation, leisurely watching the white-haired tavern owner use the sword shield to deal with the leader’s hands, the giant sword, their The swordsmanship skills are simple and rough, with a distinct Shahran Empire style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You dare to start at the Taran Pub! Don't you be afraid of facing the anger of several city owners?!" The original strength of the tavern owner should be inspired by the potion. The bloody quasi-knight, but he is old and debilitated, his blood abilities seem to increase strength, agility rather than supernatural power, so he is fiercely fighting with the leader of the prime minister, and wins and loses at one time. However, it is possible to open a pub in the east of the exile, and there must be support from big people behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the man’s hands with a giant sword, blocked by the shield, quickly hit the hilt, stopped the tavern’s sword, and sneered twice: “If not found Leo, of course we dare not do it in the Taran pub, but now Leo is hiding in your secret room! He just sinned the bastards of our young masters, even if they are in the meeting of the lords, several city owners will not say anything. At the very least, we will compensate you for the loss of your pub!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the customers in the pub have already ran out of the majority, and the crowded halls have become sparse. Lu Xien went halfway and suddenly heard a loud noise. The entire door suddenly fell back and forth, and several alcoholic heads broke their blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head just right, avoiding the debris of the gate, Lucien saw a large number of people coming in at the door. Most of them wore black scales similar to those of a one-eyed man. The lead was a young man with a gray-white cigar. He didn't wear the leather armor, scales, and half-length armor that the adventurers common, but with Lucien. The same, very "Holm taste" wearing a white shirt, brown vest, black double-breasted long dress, wearing a high-colored hat, face thin, nose high, looks pretty good, but black eyebrows mess The face is cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on both sides of an imposing man, the same Holm style on the left, short stature, shiny shoes, pale gray eyes cold and ruthless The right side is tall and strong, casually covered with a brown leather armor, muscle knots, every step of the step on the floor squeaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man looked around at the pub hall and found a chair at the door to sit down, his right hand stretched out, and a beautiful blonde woman behind him squatted in front of him. Next, help him untie the cufflinks. His expression was dull, wearing a light blue dress in the court of Tria, with a white flower on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Arorim, trouble you to help catch Leo." The young man smiled and told him that after a few days of hunting, he finally caught this. The guy who broke his good deeds, and the anger that he had not been able to vent completely completely burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His black shiny shoes were lightly glimpsed, and the whole person turned into a residual image and rushed to the back of the pub. At the same time, the knight's momentum was released without reservation, so that many guests who had no time to leave the pub were suppressed and their hands and feet were soft. OK, blocking the road of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien squeezed out of the crowd and leaned closer to the gate, Arolim had already returned with Leo, which is not the strength of the quasi-knight. It is far lower than the official knight. For example, Lucien can use the agile to fight with the general knight before taking the "blood venom", but Leo is surrounded by several quasi-knights. Ability to withstand a formal knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Leo was arrested, the tavern owner and the bartender gave up fighting with swordsmen such as one-eyed men, standing with shields and swords not far away. Thinking about how to ask for love, how much it costs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Leo with a little curiosity. He was struggling in the hands of Arollim. He was a middle-aged man with white hair. Bitter, eyes closed, wrinkles around the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚, Yarolim lost Leo to the young man Warren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo has a layer of black flame burning, as if swallowing all his strength, so that he can not even climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren leaned forward, smiled and extended his right hand, slamming Leo’s face: "Mr. Leo, I am very happy to see you again." I don't know what you want to say to me?" His light blue eyes are full of tyrannical flavors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo opened his eyes with difficulty, the muddy green pupil had pain and despair, but there was no regret: "Master Warren, I just reminded the person. Miss aristocratic sentence, let her not be deceived by you, but you are a famous trafficker in the exile of the East, through your training, the humans, elves, dwarves, orcs sent to the Shahran Empire are still less? If you have the power to destroy Caravan, I naturally have no choice but to watch as you ruin the noble lady, but you don’t have..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren is dangerous and restrained, right hand retracted And 蔼 laughed and said: "Mr. Leo, you are really a good person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, his right leg kicked out and kicked in thunder The abdomen of Europe made the Leo shrimp curl up and screamed in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put your right foot in front of the blonde and let her carefully rub the upper. Warren touched his chin: "In fact, I am confused. Leo, why are you destroying my business? You didn’t know the lady before, why didn’t you remind me of such a big danger? Did your old guy look at her? Hey, although she did Very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo violently coughed, and finally squeezed out a sentence: "This is my principle, since it has encountered, and has the ability to stop, You can't watch a curious girl breaking into the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mr. Leo, you are a man with a knight spirit, but unfortunately you Not a real knight, but the principle of being empty can only be stepped on by my vicious bad guy." Warren took his right foot from the blond girl's arms and stepped on Leo's head, crushing him, adding a sentence. "You can only be killed by the whole family and flee here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leo was Since sad memories, throat rattle He He, like dying beast, so around who have a sense of adventure and their own sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren turned to the tavern owner: "You don't need to talk, because the guy who dares to destroy me must have a miserable end to maintain my majesty. Shocking other bastards. I am not a person who can easily make an idea with a kitten or a puppy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in danger, and the pub owner is stagnation, saying no When I spoke, I turned to the head and said: "Stop him first. After the smashing, cut off the limbs and hang it on the wooden frame outside the city gate. When the wild dog arrives at night, eat him bit by bit." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warren said, while he released the foot on Leo’s head and kicked him to the one-eyed man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed man waited to hold Leo, and the big fist slammed on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of a knock on the door came, and they subconsciously stopped moving, and looked back, only to see the short black hair. A brown pupil, wearing a monocle, wearing a young man similar to Warren walked out of the crowd, stepping on the floor with a pair of shoes and simulating the sound of knocking on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
