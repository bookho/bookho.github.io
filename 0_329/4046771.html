			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot hurricane blew through, as if it could ignite everything that happened on the road, but there were flames and melts everywhere, and there was no normal thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the different air changes in different locations, I don’t know where the sun is shining from different places, causing a half-empty illusion. hazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Lord of Fire" ancient inflammation is at the heart of the "Boiled Ocean", and the anxious violently moves back and forth, and the heart is filled with destruction, killing and burning all the time. Desire, I desperately want an enemy to appear in front of myself and let myself vent this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special demon of the flame lord, the fire element elder, the giant fire element, etc., has long since left it, fearing that it will be killed by accident. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to the usual time, the "Ancient Fire Demon" with a flame-like character must have gathered its own demon army, toward his own enemy "Millet Snow" A new round of offensive was launched to ease their anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Ice and Snow" is the lord of the "Aurora Plain" on the 318th floor of the abyss. It is also the third-order "Devil King", because they are good at each other. The conflict, with the "Ancient Fire Devil" is a pair of deadly enemies, often launching wars, trying to destroy each other - in the endless abyss, in addition to the hidden "chaotic starry sky" and several special planes, the remaining layers can be Uninterruptedly connected to each other without passing through the intermediate planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it wasn't for Gonheim to let me stay here to stop the damn magician, I must have wiped out the cold, cold, and temperatureless monster!" "The ancient sorcerer's hand carries a long sword with a flame condensed. With each wave of it, it can pick up the horrible melt waves and flame storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels that its patience has reached its limit - although it has never had the patience of this kind of thing, so the two small sun-like eyes look far away The flame lords at the office: "Why don't you dare to approach me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because we fear you, respect you!" The thirteen flame lords around felt suddenly Bad, answer very consistently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of answer made the "Ancient Fire Devil" quite satisfied, but it immediately became angry and angry: "I am afraid of me, I hate me, so far from answering me." I want to betray me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame lords are scared to tremble with the flames of the body. It is a tragedy to encounter this unreasonable and erratic king. - Of course, in the endless abyss, such kings are common, and the "dark Lord" and "death monarch" (the undead master) are the devil kings who do not arbitrarily destroy their subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cold wind blew through, and the fire elements in midair freeze into red ice and fall into the melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling boiling ocean surface seems to be solidified in time, like the same vivid picture, even a half-breaking bubble is like that Crystal clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to this abyss is filled with horrific blizzards, icy winds and hurricanes, large singular snowflakes mixed with ice crystals constantly drifting. The blizzard reveals a female face, deep facial features, exquisite appearance, but no vivid atmosphere, like a statue completed by a human artist, beautiful but dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! You actually sent yourself to death!" When the "Lord of Fire" saw this situation, it was angry and excited, and he couldn’t easily press the impulse. Without attacking her, she dared to come and attack "Boil the Sea"! However, in this way, his anger will have a venting object! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the strongest of the blizzards, the owner of the "Aurora Plains", the demon king "Mrs. Ice"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sorcerer raised the huge flame sword. The nose spewed two green smoke, and the wings woven by the flames flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole pulverized ocean is completely boiling, just like the volcanic eruption at the bottom of the dying, the sea is shaking, the fire column is sprayed, the temperature is rising rapidly, and the snow and ice are melting. The blizzard was stained with a layer of flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "welcome" of this fire column, "Ancient Fire Demon" flew around "Ms. Snow" and slammed it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This huge flame sword with a high temperature and unimaginable power that can burn everything breaks the white fog caused by the surrounding low temperature, breaking through the diffuse snow And ice crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the face opened open and sent out a chaotic demon language, a blue ray hitting and hitting the flame sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning flame on the sword grew cold and then went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blizzard is once again filled with, the ice lord, the frost giant, the ice and snow elf (non-elf family) and other "Aurora Plains" demon and flame lord, fire element elders, etc." Boiling the ocean, the devil is struggling together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "frozen fortress", the "dark Lord" who is concerned about "boiling the ocean" Gonheim’s right index finger gently taps the handrail: "I thought it was restrained." The demon, you can avoid their re-engagement, let him safely drag Lu Xien = Evans, I can not think that Ms. Ice will take the initiative to attack ... who is making her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the past many years, the battle between ice and snow is basically provoked by the "Ancient Fire Devil". Because of the influence of its own power on personality, Ms. Bing has only a few dozen active attacks, so " The Dark Lord did not anticipate this at first - even if it was expected, it would have no way, because "Ms. Snow" and the "Frozen Fortress" are also enemies, and it is impossible to listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Gonheim has been promoted to the legendary peak and become the demon prince, but the legendary third-order "demon king" does not have an overwhelming advantage, willing to listen to it Less than half of the orders, and at any time betrayed - at the home of these "demon kings", they have the strength of close to the legendary peak, enough to protect themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it Lucien=Evans? He has been postponed for a while, is he making these preparations?" Gonheim smelled the conspiracy, while Make up your mind, you must complete the rule of all demon kings with wisdom and strength as soon as possible, so that you have enough foundation to spy on the level of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boiling ocean sometimes freezes, sometimes burns, and is in a fierce battle. Gradually, "Mrs. Ice" is crushed by the "Lord of Fire". After all, this is the abyss plane that belongs to it, and it is the home of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the blizzard spread out and became a cold wind with a quiet, cold taste, constantly blowing toward the ancient sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the cold wind in the cold is unimaginable death, the flame that it blows through is exhausted, even if it is " The ancient flame elf, the natural flame elf, couldn’t help but shudder. It seems that this is a calm breath from the depths of the soul! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, its movements have become slower, and the boiling ocean seems to be in a eternal silence! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not Lucien=Evans! It’s the Duke of Frost, this is the power of Silent Hell!” The Dark Lord Gonheim slams The index finger is solidified in the same place, and the eyes are slightly picked up. "What can it gain when it blends in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eternal silence and icy let it Doubt, it did not expect the "Frost Duke" to intervene in this matter, although its big demon is only the legendary second-order, but the "Millet and Snow Lady" that combines the power of "silent hell" has improved the essence of its power. A little, it became very scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient sorcerer screamed, the blue and white flames around it turned orange, like a light in a human city, warm but not blazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warm flame quickly dispels the silence of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, in the snowstorm that Ms. Snow and Snow has made, countless snow and ice elves sing and sing, all the silence is broken, and a low voice is concealed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good! Not the Duke of Frost, or Lucien = Evans!" "The Dark Lord" stood up, and if it was not doubtful, it certainly could not Notice that this is not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low voice is obviously issued by Lucien = Evans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
