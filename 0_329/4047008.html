			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the holy city of Lance, the highest elevation is the Great Light Hall, followed by the Economics Hall of the St. Bissau Theological Seminary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building is similar to the Colosseum in the Kingdom of Shaq. The center is flat and has a sloping platform. There is no top, and the surrounding seats are circled. The type goes up to the height of tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you stand in the center, you can see at a glance, the people above the seat are densely packed, and the eyes are all countless on all sides, and the pressure cannot be said. The sun at high altitude passes through the top, sprinkling golden radiance, as if the true god is watching here, the sense of sacredness rises sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sun sets, the afterglow of the setting sun shines into the hall, dyeing everything into a brilliant golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the light of this golden light, the entire hall has maintained a strange silence, it seems that something horrible is brewing, waiting for the explosion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the embodiment of the Lord of Hell, the greatest demon, and the Lord is slumbering and stealing His authority in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to reverberate in the hall, echoing in the hearts of everyone, vibrating and worrying, making people doubt in their dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the church, has anyone ever questioned the pope in person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the church, who dares to disrespect the Pope? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the church, who dares to accuse the pope of being the embodiment of the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil can perform "God Drop", can the devil bring us to defeat the magician, the dark creatures and the different gods church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ridiculously funny, the clergymen fell into a state of inability to speak, stunned at the high-pitched pope on the high platform, stunned and looked down It seems that Saint Ivan is wearing a golden blouse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is going on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the strongest and most devout saint against the pope? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of "exceptional punishment"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s at this time. Someone said in a loud voice: "In the Holy Scriptures, the bishops are jealous of us, we must not worship idols, and we must not worship statues. Therefore, we only establish a cross, but you openly declare that you are the embodiment of the Lord and the spokesperson of His land. Let us worship, let us obey. This is contrary to the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. Only the devil can do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, others stood up and blamed His Majesty the Pope is the embodiment of "Lord of Hell"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerics throughout the hall looked at it and saw another Saint Felix walked behind St. Ivan, followed. They saw that the two saints Alexei and Uliel also came out. Seven priests of the Holy Spirit, such as Souter, Allers, and Sirius, followed closely! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many saints. So many of you support St Ivan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it true that Pope is the biggest devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The absurd, the Pope has just used 'God Drop' to reinvent the 'Lord of the Lord'. He drove him back to hell." Saint Quent Angrily accused the group of traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you trust everyone!" Ivan said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Gregory left his hand to prevent other saints and priests from arguing with Ivan. He raised the Platinum Scepter and solemnly said:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All who turn away from the Lord will deprive the glory and fall to hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wordless useless, Lord's Grace will naturally prove everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light became milky, solemn and holy, and Ivan, Felix and others flew out of the light and dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extreme punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All clergy can't help but tremble, this is the ironclad proof of the status of the pope, if the pope is not the Lord's "land agent" "What can he do to deprive other clerics of the "gift of the Lord" so that they can no longer supplement the magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the adults of St. Ivan must have been blinded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they all expect from the heart that the Pope can forgive the ignorance of Saint Ivan, or just punish the leader, after all, so many saints and the Holy Spirit If the priest loses all, even if the church of truth is big, it will be badly hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Ivan opened his arms as if embracing the world and embracing the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless tiny angels around him, surrounded by him, and the singer is watching him, praising him and merging into the ethereal and solemn voice of the Holy Spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The void above the sky slammed open a big hole, the projection of the paradise mountain appeared, a little bit of light flew out, gathered behind Ivan into a pair of transcendental objects, sacred and inviolable Wings, shining wings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and space turbulence, the breath of "outstanding punishment" was expelled, and Ivan's breath rose, giving the clergy a similar feeling to the pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil! Look at your eyes and see, this is the gift of the Lord!" Ivan said, "Our gods come from the Lord." Gifts, only the Lord can be deprived, others will never do, and only the devil will find ways to disguise the ability to deprive us of glory. This is a testimony of his stealing of sovereignty!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although logically very problematic, but at this time the clergy can distinguish so much, even if the support of the Pope's saints and the Holy Spirit pastor, all stunned, "out of penalty" actually failed. ! Ivan is close to the level of the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t dare to think or want to think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your strength comes from the devil, only the power of the devil is not affected by the 'exceptional penalty'!" Pope Gregory said calmly and majesticly, then he Raised his right hand and raised the Platinum Scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimpse of the crowd, "God Drop"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sunset is gradually falling, and there seems to be a silver moon rising in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory hesitated a moment and cast a "light of judgment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan has no idea of ​​fighting the Pope in the encirclement of so many saints and Holy Spirit priests, and the wings behind the radiance of divine power suddenly sway and shine. Time and space turbulence, offsetting the "light of judgment", while the other saints and priests of the Holy Spirit inspired a one-off legendary item that had been prepared for a while and disappeared into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the face of reprimanding can we break the majesty that the Pope has formed over the years and lay a good foundation for future development. This danger cannot be avoided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregory didn’t expect them to run away, a little late. The face was a bit ugly and plain: "Ivan, Felix... was tempted by the devil, betrayed the Lord, and the members of the remaining Cardinal Missions, except for those who guarded the locals, the rest went with me to purify them in the north!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cathedral of St. Andrew, the capital of the Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of expressionless knights rushed into the church, under the leadership of some clergy, arrested the so-called "heresy" according to the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan, Felix and others immediately changed the structure of the transmission array after the transmission array appeared in the cathedral, preventing the pope from coming directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is things going well?" inside the cathedral. A man wearing a crown asked dignifiedly. He is as strong as a bear and has a funny rosacea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, everything goes well." Felix replaced Ivan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile on his face. Respectfully respecting the Ivan Knights: "Please ask the Holy Ivan to crown the Pope!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please ask the Holy Ivan to strengthen the Pope!" Felix And others have also been saluting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan’s face is unchanged. Raise your right hand. Serious and solemn: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will lead the devotees, eliminate heresy, and restore the glory of the Lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Holy calendar year 425 years. Above the highest religious meeting, Ivan and other cardinals rebelled and the church split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark mountains, a night watchman with a cloak looked Look at the time, wait until the "supreme religious meeting" is almost over, and walk to the initial establishment of the "Dark Council" headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the messenger of the New Truth, seeking to see Danishos and Dracula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Supreme Council of Religions was held, Douglas had a premonition to invite the "House of the Wizards", "The Soul is High", " The gatherings of Palmeira's Cabin, Elemental Will, and Shadow Singer are gathering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the magic tower, the magicians below the ** division exchange knowledge, exchange items, magic tower, Douglas, Atlante, deep cold The legendary magicians such as Lord, Congos, and Amanta, together with Fernando, Hathaway, and Vicente, discussed the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Douglas’s face changed slightly, and a half-plane behind the real world stood out and swayed gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Information from Hell, above the highest religious meeting, Saint Ivan stood up and accused the Pope of being the devil's incarnation, using this as an excuse to split the church, in the sand The Helan Empire established a new church of truth. He was supported by seven priests such as Felix, Alexei, Ullile, and Souter, and was given the cardinal of the northern parishes. Support, with the support of all epic knights in the northern countries." Douglas quickly stabilized his emotions and solemnly told everyone about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The news is too amazing. Many magicians have taken out the crystal ball and applied "Astrology" to determine the true and false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no one concealed and covered up, they got the results smoothly, and they looked at Douglas with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas stood up directly: "Hethersea contacted Hoffenberg to let them fulfill their promises, and we will stand up in accordance with the agreement. Let them understand that they are definitely not the ones who dare to lurk in the darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carola, you are responsible for the North Coastal Corridor, do not seek to destroy this The cathedral of the parish is only to stand firm. We are not strong enough, and the nobles will not watch us completely expel the church." Douglas looked at the "Lord of the Cold." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The Lord of the Deep Cold has no dissatisfaction with Douglas's command, his strength, his talent, his achievements in the arcane, let himself Deeply impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are in charge of the Kingdom of Colette." Congus took the initiative to ask for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of the Curse is not to be left behind: "I and Elika are going to the Principality of Calais."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to Cox." Vicente spoke indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas heard his story and nodded: "Then you and Erica will change positions."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looks at the "Lord of Shadows" Amanatha: "Trouble you to the Kingdom of Buriana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanata Point Nod, it is promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The matter of the Holm kingdom is handed over to our parliament." Douglas tightened his neckline. "Now, we have to mobilize everyone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
