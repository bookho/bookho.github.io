			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 33rd floor of the Magic Council Headquarters, a room that is not too big, the sun shines through the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the tables and chairs that are neatly placed The bookshelf is dyed with a hint of golden luster, which is more and more clean and tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to Lucien and the soup, Fernando received a letter from an old friend, so they waited for other students to arrive. Qi, he entered the cubicle and read the letter quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Tang, thank you for letting me enter the Douglas Magic School, otherwise the initial study and research will be trapped in materials and laboratories." No one, in order to avoid the boring ambiguity of the atmosphere, Lucien provoked the topic by the head of gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged gentleman-like soup spectrum pushed the gold-rimmed glasses and smiled slightly: "Don’t thank you very much, any member saw the application. You will be curious to adjust your paper to see that this is the instinct of the Arcanist, and the paper can get such an evaluation in the absence of contact with Arcane. As long as the Commissioner and you have no hatred in the past, you will agree with you. Apply and ask the school to pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Mr. Tang Li also recommended my paper to the teacher." Lu Xi'an looks like this looks like It is a study room, and it is like a small conference room. It is a bit puzzled: "I thought the teacher would take us to his half-face magic tower to discuss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The soup kept a smile: "According to the rules of the highest review team, the seven Arcanists must keep one in Allinge, so they are rotated every five years after consultation. Yes, we are all teachers. Don't be so polite, just call me the soup spectrum. In fact, your Austrian The level should have reached level 5, which is not much different from my level 6."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes swept the arcane and magical badges of the left chest. They haven't had time to update yet, they are still four and three rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The arcane level will take about three or four months." Lucien thought that when he left, the arcane score was more than 850. Because it saves time when you come back, the whole task is just one year and one month, according to the monthly feedback from the paper and the new magic quoted at about ten speeds, now it should not be a five-level arcian . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum shook his head and randomly found a chair to sit down: "The role and status of the periodic table in the field of elements believe that Lucien you know better than me, This year coincides with the atomic valence of elements, that is, the vigorous development of the reaction valence of different elements. It has matured from the emerging era, and the number of published papers is very large. It is one of the manifestations of the periodicity of the elements, and it is necessary to talk about the atomic valence state. I am sure that I can't get around the periodic table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the memory of my paper, judging from your paper, your arcane score should exceed one thousand a few months ago. This has made many Arcans masters quite embarrassed, and proposed to the Arcane Review Committee the results of the basic period of the Periodic Table of Elements, which should be used at any time, such as atomic weight data, formula constants, calculation formulas, and primary alchemy reactions. There is a limit on the length of time, otherwise the growth of Arcane points is unreasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half, the soup deliberately stopped, seems to be intended to cause Lucy Graceful curiosity. He is good at explosions, flames, and high-temperature magic. He is a high-ranking magician in the field of heat and elements, but he has not joined any organization. He is a pure parliamentary school like the storm master. He is a genius in the magical field of Lucien. Very optimistic, but also willing to make friends - in another faction "Star System" that he is good at, Lucien has not published any outstanding papers, and is widely considered to be only a genius in the field of elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the audit committee agreeing?" Lucien asked along the dictionary and was happy with K. His current research direction is to follow Larry went deep into the field of atomic valence, and his flourishing development in this area shows that his gains are not too shallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum laughs and laughs: "How can the audit committee agree that as the elemental magic researches on each direction of the reference period, the latecomer only needs to quote Their papers will do, unless they are intended to systematically elaborate. After two years, Lucien's feedback on the Arcane points that you harvested from the Periodic Table of the Elements will drop rapidly and tend to be slow and stable."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very good." Lucian made up his mind to "revise" the periodic table of elements once in a while, so that the direct reference obtained will increase again, anyway. The previous periodic table of elements, due to the limitations of current research results, deliberately left or had to leave many problems, such as rare gases, because of their own magic level and laboratory conditions, it is difficult to separate, and now everything is different. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for the exchange to sound. As the knocking sounded, a young, medium-sized man came in. His face was so thin that his cheekbones were protruding, and the light blue eyes were like the summer sky, clean and transparent. A faint sorrow, the whole poet is more than a magician, but the badge of his gray suit chest can not be underestimated, a seven silver star black base arcade badge, a seven black ring silver magic badge, one The single is holding a quill pen pattern of the Arcane Review Board badge, and a medal with numerous ice crystal patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this is another teacher of the teacher Chloe, a member of the Arcane Review Committee, the authority of the thermodynamics molecular movement, is currently trying From a deeper level, use the knowledge of probability and statistics to study the second law.” Tang Ji introduced to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second law of thermodynamics was summed up by Fernando and others in order to refute an idea in the development of the Magic Council, with the "thermal theory" being discarded, heat and The energy is closely related, and the magicians realize that when the temperature of the object is lowered, it will release heat, because many people think that the magical array can be maintained by extracting heat from the endless seawater, but their imagination has failed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he said to Chloe: "Chloe, this is Lucy Evans who just studied with the teacher, the Holm Crown Award ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe has no fleshy cheeks with a faint smile: "Hello, Evans."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't talk much, and after sitting, he sat quietly aside, as if he had fallen into his own world, completely forgetting that there were other people in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, two high-level magicians from the seven rings arrived. According to the introduction of the soup, the woman is Asikana and the man is Leah. ? Carter, they all maintain the look of youth and maturity, but their achievements in arcaneism are much smaller than Chloe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just summoned them with them, but they didn’t have time to talk, and there was a rush of knocking on the door, which seemed a bit rude. Tang Pei and others all smiled and shook their heads, and got up and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dragon with a transparent and beautiful scales appeared in front of Lucien, this is the first time Lucien saw a station face to face The dragon on the upper layer of the magical creature chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon also curiously glanced at Lucien, and then said with a child, "I know you, you are the one with a nice ring." The magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stared at the "element" of the Holm crown ring on the right index finger of Lucien, unable to open his eyes for a long time. : "Can you give it to me? I can sign a contract for a hundred years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aphras, don't mess around." Soup spectrum reluctantly swears With one sentence, he turned to Lucien: "It has sold itself once and sold it again and it has no effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Was shocked by Aphrodite's direct, and then quietly sighed when he heard the soup, where did the dragon come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris reluctantly regained his gaze, flashing a shimmer on his body, quickly getting smaller, and then stepping like a giant wolf dog . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, it is a crystal dragon, hatched by a dragon egg that the teacher picked up more than 50 years ago, has been following the teacher and We learn magic, and we have a great talent in arcaneism. It is much better than the compatriots who need to grow up to enter the higher ranks. However, due to the failure of previous magic experiments, Aphrodite suffered a serious curse and could not Growing up, can not be transformed into other appearances, it takes about a hundred years to eliminate." Tang Ji introduced this Fernando pet, which is also the dragon of his students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold short hair, green eyes, Leah, see Affris, walking around Lucien, looking away from the beautiful Holm crown ring, Then he smiled and shifted his attention: "Aphras, what research are you doing recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, recently?" Affris Inadvertently "Authentic: "I have been sleeping late and have not done anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup directly reveals its bottom: "Hey, it sells itself because of greed It has been researched recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
