			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron adults, the shadows do not leave traces of their leaving." Long Sang? Aaron solemnly but respectfully reported to Todd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd grips the sword and looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dark and dark, full of earthy smell and rotten smell, full of tall black firs and strange bush plants, deep in the Black Forest of Melze There is not much difference in other places. The only conspicuous trait is a boulder with a slightly special shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no river here, what do they rely on to avoid the shadows? Unless, not good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thoughts in my heart just rose, Todd slammed into Aaron, the sword slashed upward with a touch of blood, while the left hand of the iron glove shattered the metallic light, and after a rapid stretch, it became a square shield. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Aaron was hit by Todd, he flung down from a tall black fir tree in a white knight’s costume. She held a long sword around the silver-white snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp and loud metal crash sounded far away in the quiet forest, and Todd’s bloody long sword was directly opened by Natasha with the power of the jump. A crack in the void appeared on the steel shield that his body had made, and almost cut it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Todd finally blocked Natasha’s raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as early as he was prepared, the shield turned into a silvery white liquid and then re-aggregated, but the steeled body smashed and flashed countless electric lights. Let him be slightly paralyzed, and there is no instant counterattack that can make Natasha fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he failed to raid Aaron, Natasha was not greedy, turned and fled to the other side of the Black Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Todd got rid of paralysis, he decisively followed Natasha’s back, although he was surprised that Natasha suddenly broke out of the five-level strength. But from the previous fight, I can feel that she has not fully recovered, and she can defend her critical blows when she is attacked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her escape immediately after the raid also indicates that she inferred correctly, even she may just rely on a certain agent to recover briefly, so to raid to kill the tracking expertise Longsang? Aaron is completely free from tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel's Gothic Todd strode, pulling closer to Natasha, as long as he can kill Natasha, stay here Whether Aaron will be killed by another knight, he does not care at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two chased one and quickly disappeared into the thick forest. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron was hit by Todd and flew in the air, and it fell to the ground, but another tall black fir tree crown had a black The figure slammed down with a long sword shining in the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Todd chased Natasha after running for ten seconds, the distance between the two is getting closer and closer, which makes him even more Rest assured, her strength has been restored to the ordinary five levels. The reason why I can open my own sword just now, in addition to the help of the falling power, is because Lei Mingjian can raise her strength to the same extent as herself. Now, she is more coordinated and faster than her own, but she can't run herself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that he was going to catch Natasha, Natasha suddenly turned around and held the hilt of the thunder sword with both hands, slashing it as a two-handed sword. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd’s left-hand shield is a block, the right-handed sword is a grid, and the loud metal collision sounds successfully blocked the thunder sword, which comes from the “Sword of Truth” The emptiness of blood power did not penetrate his shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this fight, Todd was more confident, holding a "steel" shield and welcoming with a bloody sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also did not retreat, once again turned into a silver-gray eyes focused on Todd, slashing, slashing, hilt attack, As if forgot to open the purpose of Todd and then go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fiercely battle into a ball, the sound of the long sword screaming like a thunder, the waves of the wind will rust around the shrubs, small stones and parts. The black firs flew backwards, and the tall trees in their fighting range were either blocked by the waist or blackened by the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't hurt, the heavier the strength, the stronger?" Todd sneered coldly. "It seems that your princess is relying on re-invigorating blood and medicine to restore some strength! How long can this recovery last? You feel yourself Can you beat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his strength is the strongman in the same rank, his blood determines that he is a great knight who is good at defending against attack. Therefore, there is a good ability to observe and provoke opponents' emotions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Todd does indeed hate the bloodliness of Natasha's variability. If it is not the more powerful the explosive force, the best is the defense. Shield", how could the Earl of Verdi be able to break through her face in less than ten seconds. Of course, the most important reason is that the Holy Light strike at the crucial moment shakes the will of the Earl of Verdi, otherwise Natasha The strength will become stronger and will still be blocked for at least one minute! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s sword squats, but Todd’s barely block, she sneered: “Hey, I will be able to defeat you in the face. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd’s sword slashed and cut to Natasha’s left shoulder, which could be recovered by her hilt recovery: “If it’s not annoying thunder The damage and paralysis effect, I have killed you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His steelmaking is very restrained by the effect of the "Thunder Sword", even just triggered A real lightning bolt almost hit him, and the result was that a bad cedar tree was completely burnt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not bicker with him, but focused on attack and defense. Since the beginning of the Cavaliers training, she has experienced forest training, hunting training, fighting with monsters. Training, combat training, belief training and other formal church knight training process, but also really went to the battlefield, killing heresy, but never had such a dangerous situation and a downwind battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it was before the rifle assaulted Verdi or the current fight with Todd, which brought her great danger, she also gave her precious The battle "wealth" not only sharpens and strengthens its own will, but also has the opportunity to thoroughly understand and master its own blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the top blood and his own fighting talent, Natasha, who grew up close to the Knights of the Sky, feels that he has never really controlled himself like this. The body, along with the slashing and slashing of every long sword in the danger, with every step of retreat and dodge, the blood and the flesh are more and more synchronized, and it seems to be "never give up, always move forward." The will gradually has signs of blending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the slamming of the long sword, Todd gradually found that it was wrong. Natasha in front of him did not become as weak as he expected, although Strength, speed, etc. have not improved, but both the momentum and the spirit have signs of cohesion, giving people a strange sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not forget the time limit, but he was not afraid, not afraid, and devoted himself to the battle, the sword of the sword slashed Straighten out the messy blood in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lu Xien holds the "vigilance", descending from the sky to Aaron, the long sword metal ray sharp and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron had no time to escape, the black dagger held in his right hand was accurately placed on the edge of the sword, while the left hand with a black shadow flame hit the road to the road. The abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, the black dagger is made of special material, the two weapons are only squeaking, and the moonlighted Lutheran leaps and walks in the air. Opened Aaron’s fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? The Cavaliers dare to raid me?" Aaron recognized Lucien, laughing and waving his dagger, even though Lucien was good at it. The speed and agility, I have to beat him, not to mention the power, physique and shadow flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien holds the vigilant sword and seals Aaron’s dagger by its length and its own speed, but the shadow of the shadow on his dagger is actually There are signs of corrosion of long swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aaron did not attack, turned into a shadow, and wandered around Lucien. But even relying on the full strength of the help of Sean's strength and rich combat experience, created a lot of opportunities to directly attack Lucien's body, he is also a touch, just cut the clothes to leave a wound and then return to return, and There is no victory to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the Earl of Verdi is because this kid's magical object attack will be defeated by Natasha, almost died under her sword, Aaron became very taboo, afraid that Lucien can still use Magic or magical items, so he has been fighting, there is no pause, so as to avoid being locked by extraordinary items, when the magic is issued, there is a certain amount of dodge, and the small wounds are still weakening Lu Xien. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small wounds are quickly restored under the good self-healing ability of the moonlight, and the shadow flame that can be stained is like a black locust struggling toward Lucy. En, he was bored in the body, and he used the strength, strength, and spirit of Lucien before he disappeared, and made Lucien weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Aaron’s choice of hands is very special, all the places where extraordinary items are worn, so Lucien’s chest clothes are broken, revealing a very holy emblem. The appearance of the "曰 冕 ,", the belt was also cut, directly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glanced at the cross emblem of the cross surrounded by the sun, and the metal ring of Lucien’s left hand wearing a sparkling sapphire, Aaron thought a little bit "This kid actually has a magic item, a magical item, an extraordinary sword, it is too wasteful! I have worked so hard for so many years, only a debilitating dagger given by the Earl of Verdi, is he Natasha's little lover?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嫉妒Emotions did not affect Aaron’s judgment, the light of two items was not normal, or they had consumed supernatural Power has not recovered, or there is only one or two attacks or defenses left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Aaron’s attack began to become fierce, and he wanted to guide Lucien to inspire extraordinary things, under his tidal attack, Lucien Although crumbling, there are no signs of using magic or magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the power of extraordinary items really used up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With time, road Sean became weaker and weaker, his footsteps were chaotic, his ankles twisted, and he fell directly in front of the strange boulder. His right hand was in the mud and the long sword fell out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t let go of this opportunity, Aaron circumvents the left hand and chest position of Wayne, fluttering from his right body, holding a dagger and stabbing him The head, whether it is a holy emblem or a ring, can only hit yourself first in this angle of attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien showed a thin round shield on his body, blocking Aaron’s black dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the burning of the dagger and the piercing of the shield, Aaron was amazed, because the two magical items did not flash, the fluctuation of the magic shield It seems to originate from Lucien's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will have a ring of magic?! He is a magician?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless past events Flashing between the flints, Aaron looked at the handsome face of Lucien with a stunned look:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor?!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took it out in the right hand of the soil, holding a dark red bracelet, it suddenly burst into a strong flame, and Aaron, who tried to shadow, swallowed and flew out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Goodbye, Mr. Aaron." Lucien smiled at the jaw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third-level high-level magic item "Woist's Bracelet", which comes from the magic apprentice fire wolf, has been buried here by Lucien, I can't think of today It came in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bracelet woven with "Edelweiss" adds two spells: "Two Rings Magic, Yangyan Bodyguard (twice a day); Three Rings Magic, Fireball (twice a day)."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skull-sized fireball wraps Aaron’s upper body, explodes and burns, until Aaron’s landing, only the rest Half a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood up with the "Woist's Bracelet", when Natasha's familiar voice suddenly sounded amazed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violently turning his head, not far from the edge of the Black Forest, Nata Saty stood there with a thunderous sword shining in the electric light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
