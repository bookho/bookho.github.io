			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal wall suspended in the air has disappeared, but the people in the Plaza Mayor and the surrounding people have been reluctant to disperse for a long time. They are still reminiscing about the name just now. The symphony of the Twilight War, this is another great work after the symphony of destiny brings the theme music trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in comparison, I think the symphony of fate is better." Sarah can't use professional and accurate vocabulary to evaluate, only his own Feeling to describe, "This symphony is grand and powerful, but the 'destiny' is more determined and powerful, and it is more touching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith chicks eat frequently Nod: "Well, I also like fate more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she quickly became frowning: "But Mr. Christopher’s concert is too Success, the new work is definitely a great piece of music. What should I do to Mr. Evans’s concert tomorrow? One final, one start, if you can’t have the level of this concert, it will definitely make everyone disappointing.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointment is hard to eliminate as long as you are impressed in the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a fate?" Sarah smiled and comforted her sister, and he himself was equally worried and nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lilith looked up and looked at Sarah, who wanted to say something, but in the end she just sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all understand that the works of today’s concerts are classic, and the Symphony of Destiny is no way to hold a complete concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a dark corner, McCannz, who had an excuse to return to the territory, appeared in Aalto, his expression twisted and exhilaratingly waving his arm: "Chris President Doff is awesome, that is to use such a perfect performance to make Lucien the bastard poor without any possibility of success. Hey, such an important concert has prepared several piano pieces of solo name. It’s too arrogant. Since you are too big! After you can't satisfy everyone's expectations and can no longer be the music consultant of His Royal Highness, I will let you know what aristocrats are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to five Minutes later, the crowd at the Plaza Mayor left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friris standing on the top floor of the city hall looked down at the black tide-like crowd slowly flowing, long time no speech, melancholy and calm, and finally she was heavily I vomited and seemed to want to alleviate the tensions and worries in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the Hall of the Holy Grail, the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, Cardinal Sald, Princess Natasha and Prince Michelle are the most noble The people still stayed because they invited Christopher to the box, expressed his respect to him and regretted that a master would no longer hold a concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These big names have not left yet, and the rest of the nobles and musicians naturally continue to sit on the seats and exchange the concerts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Lucien is using his own accurate definition from the soul library and Victor and Marcus discuss the development and development of the theme of the first movement. Reproduction and end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are really talented with the theme music, music that has your own thoughts and emotions, and almost form a perfect and own style. The idea is. This is what every authoritative musician must have.” Victor is pleased to see his disciples become more mature and more like a real musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head: "In fact, many concepts and definitions are proposed by other musicians in the booming theme music trend in recent months. I just saw and learned the fusion from newspapers such as Music Review and Symphony Orchestra."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true, I have seen similar in the newspaper. Discussion.” Marcus certainly won’t admit Victor’s evaluation, and then he stared at Lucien meaningfully. “The concert of President Christopher today can definitely be called perfect, Lucien, you tomorrow. "What about the concert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor noticed that Marcus’s mood and attitude were a bit wrong. He quickly took Marcus’s arm and told him not to say it. I said to Lucien: "Lu Xien, you are still young, don't put too much pressure on it, I believe that you will eventually stand in the ranks of music masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I try to be the best, I am worthy of myself, and I am worthy of the teacher of Victor." Lucien is not as nervous and depressed as other people think, although his arrangement is indeed a little ahead. Even on Earth, the word "solo" is due to Liszt, not the masters of classical music and transitional periods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor didn’t say much, just nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly ten minutes, Dagong and others left, nobles and musicians also began to leave, and all those who met Lucian were just using the same The eyes and the expression of hard work greeted him, and no one mentioned the next day's concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Othello is very worried about Lucine’s problems, the old aristocrats and musicians who failed the concert understand that it’s time for this, and then give Lucy It’s the most stupid way to add pressure, so he also stopped those who had gloating in love and wanted to see Lucien’s jokes to stimulate Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............7:30 pm on April 5th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the last day of the festival, it is the official final concert, the streets of the Municipal Plaza and the surrounding administrative districts are crowded with noisy crowds, while others in the city The neighborhood became empty and very deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Alto side is like a flame, and it is like ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola, Sharon and others learned the lessons of the previous two. Today, they did not perform in the afternoon and went directly to the Municipal Square to wait. At this point, they gathered around the central location and gathered more and more people, and heard more and more heated discussions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I will never forget such a scene." Cellist Leslie felt with his eyes closed. "This is probably the largest continent, The concert with the most audience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola seems to be in the breeze and open his arms, his face is intoxicated: "If I can also be on such occasions There is no regret when it is a concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, this is probably a dream that cannot be realized." The honest violinist Green Shaking his head and sighing, but how could he not have a similar dream in his heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all only about twenty years old, and they are still very young. As long as they are 70 years old like Master Christopher, they still create music. Why can't they? Going to the Alto Music Festival's Shenglu Hall concert?” Sharon expressed his belief and persistence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace pointed to the half-empty sky that the crystal wall has not yet appeared: "I mentioned young, Mr. Evans, but there are still months to hold a rite of honor." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, there was a talented musician who had a concert at the Shengli Hall at the age of fifteen, but that was not his first game, nor the Aalto Music Festival. At the closing time, I don't mention Mr. Evans's music. Just because of this, he will be remembered by history." Sharon is a family of musicians and knows more about music than other companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the youngest person in the concert at the Alto Music Festival was Christopher, who boarded this at the age of twenty-six On the stage, the oldest is a part-time musician who is a big knight. The record of 112 years old is hard to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Lucien, Piola is curious but a little worried and hesitant: "The concerts and new works of Master Christopher last night were So perfect, what about Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearts of unnamed musicians such as Piola, the poor are born, experienced but frustrated The famous and talented Lu Xien is an example of himself and others, symbolizing the realization of his dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that it’s unfair to him to compare Lucien with Master Christopher, and Piola can’t help but compare After all, the two concerts, regardless of time or meaning, can be involuntarily compared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In less than a year, Mr. Evans has already had the great work of "Fate" and other excellent serenade and piano. The essay, even if the concert is unsuccessful today, can't hide his light." Silence for a while, Grace first answered, "As long as his concert can have half the height of Master Christopher, I think even Success!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were worried to hear that everyone around us was comparing yesterday's concerts. If you can't get close to yesterday's level, I am afraid most people will not think that Lucien is a success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Outside the St. John's Hall, wearing a black tuxedo, the increasingly handsome Lucien and Rhein and other band members greeted the distinguished guests in the small hall. advent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeous carriage came, a nobleman and musician walked into the hall, where there was the Earl of Hain, Rafa, who was known by Lucien. Count Earl, Earl Hill, Othello, and others, there are also foreign aristocrats and musicians who are unfamiliar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher is coming, he and He smiled and nodded to Lucien, let him relax, don’t have any pressure, follow his Sylvie Ya also expressed the same meaning with a quiet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor came, and he used simple gestures to show that he had confidence in Lucien, but the tension on his face could not be concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis, John, Joel, Alisa, Avon, and Elena are also coming, they try to make themselves look calm, However, the fears and uncomfortable movements in the eyes revealed their true feelings, and they did not change until they entered the western small stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark purple carriage came, a simple ordinary carriage, the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, Princess Natasha, Prince Michel and Cardinal Sald At the same time, under the aristocracy, they did not forget to turn their heads and say hello to Lucien on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Natasha is smiling, purple eyebrows pick and pick, and use the mouth to say: "I believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 7:50, all the audience arrived, and Lucien returned to the background for final preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the box, Waorit’s grandfather frowned slightly and criticized Natasha’s sentence: “You have arranged Lucien on such an occasion. Do you not worry about destroying a musical genius when you hold a concert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very impressed with the symphony of destiny, but prefers to give to Sylvie Ya, the piano piece, because it reminds him of his beautiful love when he was young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, dear cousin, you are so reckless, even if Lucien is your music consultant, he is not qualified to hold a concert on this occasion. Verdi smiled and looked at Natasha. "He only has one and a half outstanding works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young people just don't be beaten by pressure, more It has been a few occasions for them to grow up. I agree with this, and the Princess of the Princess is only proposing." Natasha has not answered, and Christopher took responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde also nodded: "From the previous symphony, we can see that this young man has a tough, not compromised darkness. In the heart, the Lord will care for him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the approval of two masters in the field of magic and music, Natasha is proud, like a smile: "Dear Cousin, I think Lu Xien’s concert will definitely be a great success. What do you think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am waiting to appreciate.” Will The first face was a face that was completely unbelievable, but he did not bicker with Natasha, and seemed to have something to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the concert is about to begin." Grandma Waorit watched Lucian walk to the stage and walked to the front of the band. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the Municipal Square, the faint glow lights up and the crystal wall appears like the previous two nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the band on the stage can be clearly seen through the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope Mr. Evans can succeed." Lilith looked at the crystal wall very nervously, her hands clenched into fists, and her brother Sarah was full. Concerned about the face, Piola and others also looked at the crystal wall in front of them with a touch of worry and tension, waiting for the talented musician Lucien? Evans' appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wearing a black tuxedo set foot on the stage, the hair was carefully combed, and the whole person looked calm and handsome, very temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
