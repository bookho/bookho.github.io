			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast expanse of the seventh layer of Heaven Mountain erupted, and the purest and most innocent light swept out, turning the sky into a splendid ocean, The sound, color and feeling are all stripped off,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bright and illuminating sea of ​​light is rushing toward the "ball-shaped magic array" below, this moment, There seems to be no time and space. Only the "God of the Gods" shines inexorably, and the spherical magic circle and the roadside inside are solidified in the yellow pages of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the range of Shennong, Fernando can only sense the range of less than one meter around, in addition to the eyes, mental strength The field is full of sacred light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in the vastness of the vastness of the world, the silver moon rises, the cold dreams, the coldness shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the appearance of "Silver Moon", the hooligans of "God Drop" seem to be slow, the spherical magic circle and the inside of the road are fresh Lived up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "Silver Moon" Aitna's block, "Pope" Wicken is not surprised, his "God Drop" is not based on Him As the goal, the scope of power is centered on the "ball-shaped magic array", which only affects him. Therefore, he who has spare power will definitely "block" from the side to give Lucien? Evans is fighting for the opportunity to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, He is a little late, Lucien? Evans has now carried out the most critical moment of the impact class, and it is difficult to separate from the "ball-shaped magic array", which is destined to be destroyed under the "God Drop". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact, the "Pope" Wicken also regrets, he did not think about killing Lucien in this regard? Evans, the road ahead is extremely dangerous, such an excellent pathfinder is really difficult to estimate the wealth, but who told him to be full of ambition, plan to force, step by step to the point where must kill the killer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silver Moon" quickly dimmed, and the "God Drop" light even slowed down, and it quickly rushed into the "ball-shaped magic array" over the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien looked up again in the "ball-shaped magic array" and looked up, his eyes deep, and the pupils were all reflected in the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mouth twitched slightly, bringing out a gentle smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This..."The Pope" Wicken seems to be able to sense the situation within the spherical magical array through "God Drop", not to be depressed and not desperate for Lucien However, it feels a little stunned like a farewell to myself. There is a certain hunch in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s entire body in a white shirt and yellow vest exploded, like a watermelon being thrown from the height of 10,000 meters to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flesh flies, the light of "God Drop" is completely overwhelmed here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atomic universe, Babel, a secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A singular look, like a silver talisman bent around the intestines, shining bright but not glaring in the long enamel-filled scorpion The feeling of life is filled with the whole room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, who holds the long sword and guards this, sees it, and his expression becomes dignified. His hands clasp the "sword of truth", and it seems to be able to swing out at any time. Break the attack that follows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of various magical gems poured into the silver talisman, and other materials in the long scorpion also decomposed and merged into it. This "silver talisman" faded beautifully. The appearance, reduced to a group of blood-stained objects, and then continue to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal organs have grown, the bones have grown, the muscles have grown, and the skin and hair have grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha’s dignified expression disappeared, and she looked at the scene with a smile, not only was not disgusted by the heavy taste, but instead eagerly rubbed her chin: The unformed body is so ugly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, his eyes slowly opened, and the dark and deep eyes seemed to have traces of dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God Fall?" Natasha looked like a bad "gentleman" and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residual image in Lucien’s eyes disappeared and nodded lightly: “Thanks to me, I still have a tail at home, otherwise there will be a 'silver moon’ block. Don't even think about avoiding 'God Fall'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, Lucien planned to use self-destruction to avoid the "pope" Viken's critical strike. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a tail I am proud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the feeling of "face to face" Gods? How terrible is it?" Natasha asked in a row, she was very involved in this battle. Interested, very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s mouth twitched: “Do you let me talk to you naked?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You didn't tell me anything without a naked body." Natasha was not afraid of the eyes falling off, of course, she also threw the prepared clothes to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she deliberately asked: "What about your equipment? Don't be damaged in 'self-explosive' and 'God'."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clearly knows that her husband is essentially a financial fan. If he loses a few legendary items, he will be saddened to death, so he will ridicule him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien dressed as he smirked: "Of course, at the teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ocean of the Holy Light, the "ball-shaped magic array" quickly disintegrated and melted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando, who has been deliberately outside the scope of "God's Fall", sees the spell directly, opens the "gate of time and space", and goes to his own half plane. "Thunder hell" "jumps" away, but in the "spherical" magic array next to the "abyss will" can not escape, but also by the "God drop" spread, one eye burst, one arm fell, miserable The cries let the earth rush out of the dark and chaotic water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is not fused with the genus of the gods?" "Pope" Wicken is not surprised that Lucien will blew himself as a former legendary magician He knows the magician's means of escape and resurrection, but what he did not expect is that at the last moment, Lucien? Evans is so easy to blew himself, not affected by the "spherical magic array". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he was at the critical moment before, he had already avoided the impact and replaced his body with alchemy items? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case, it means that he never thought about attacking the gods. What is he doing for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the "Pope" Wicken eyes set off, no matter the "Abyss Will" and "Lord of Hell" below, straightforwardly tearing the space, Returns the position corresponding to the main material world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Hell" also discovered the strangeness, the full strength of the outbreak, and the "Abyss will" that will be once again affected by the "God Drop" Deported back to the "Endless Abyss" and then returned to the same space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bleak silver moon has long since disappeared, and the sky of the dead spirits has returned to gray and gray. Only one silver hair wearing a red jacket and a black turtleneck coat The man slowly walked out of the woods and chuckled: "I didn't even have the chance to play. It was really sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Aringe, the pale fog is gradually thicker, and it will be hidden from the "natural beauty" and the "cognitive world" like the vast sky. Only the starlight that fell in the dark sky is still very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Avenger" Melmos took more than 20 minutes to get to the vicinity of "Allinge", just to see this scene, he took a deep breath Tone, the sword rises up and launches an attack directly toward the "City of the Sky". It must stop Douglas from attacking the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
