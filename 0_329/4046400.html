			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Sophia’s smile, the flowing lace swayed, and the other “ambitious” aristocratic children’s eyes became poor, with a little bit of hatred. Looking at Lu Xien with deep doubts, what secret did he say, can the Princess of the Princess smile so happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that Princess Sophia’s surname is lively, but it is a formal royalty member who has been promoted by good court etiquette. It is a model of true lady, Jocelyn Such an elegant symbol that aristocratic girls try to imitate, and such eccentric laughter rarely occurs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing that he was a little rude, Sophia raised her right hand and covered her mouth. After a few seconds of calming, she smiled and licked the green eyes. "Bolak, well, you are a funny person, more interesting than I thought before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia, who is not too old, is active in social situations. The time is exactly the scorpion of Borak's frustration. Facing the elegant and powerful princess, he only has deep inferiority and never dares to step closer. Even if he wants to strengthen his position by marriage, he can be noble. The princess is the unsuccessful thing that he is not qualified to fight for even his successor position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Sophia’s impression of Borak is only gloom, dumb, and hopeless to become the Duke of the Gorse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien pondered that Borak’s confidence in the “just becoming a formal knight” was provoked by Alten and would definitely counterattack. This is normal, so I stood up and teased Sophia with a small flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your princess's compliment." Lucien exaggeratedly performed a gentleman's ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the old man’s lips in the back of Sophia, who seemed to be in their 60s, suddenly moved slightly, if not the soul of Lucien I can't detect it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s already converging smile once again faded, holding the skirt with both hands, the white and slender neck stretched out, in the eyes of the public, to get to Lucien In the ear, the warm and sweet atmosphere: "You know more than these, only know the luxury, only know the battle, the aristocrats who do not understand humor are much more interesting, I hope not to be assimilated by them."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was praised in the normal range, but the current state is a sudden embarrassment, and Lucien was originally a suspicious person, with Natasha, John, etc. After a long period of contact, I experienced a lot of things together, and gradually let go of my heart defense. Therefore, I was not stunned by the favor of Princess Sophia. The heart is quite weird. Why is it so enthusiastic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first sight, it’s not like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it’s just "small and humorous", there is no Cavalier strength, and it’s not a good art of Borak. At present, it is not qualified to be loved at first sight. A variety of good feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a reason behind the abnormality of things, what will it be? The old man told Sophia that he had the strength of the Cavaliers, so she wanted to intervene in the big change of the heirs of the Gorse family, so that the royal family had more control over the gorse family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless doubts in the heart of Lucian, but the face is slightly red, the emotions are quite excited, while focusing on the head, while turning around in Sophia Whispered in the ear: "His Royal Highness, I will keep my own characteristics, will not let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s attitude is so standard and sincere I was flattered, but when I spoke, the breath was deliberately heavy, so that the hot breath was sprayed on the small earlobe of Sophia's white, and then she saw her tremble slightly, her neck and ears quickly stained with a layer of blush, and her brows wrinkled. Stretch out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, no matter what the reason, it will not be a sight on Borak." Lucien said coldly in his heart, but with countless " "The Emperor" and "Shadow" level "strong" are the characters who have been acting, the little girl is still too tender, you need to "professor" and then coach for a few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not look at this thing in the way of Xien, there are already a few fierce eyes in the surrounding aristocratic children, and more eyes are also going The development of the unfriendly direction, the two performed too embarrassing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, she looked at De Nie at the speed that "Bolaq" couldn't answer: "I have something to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we go to the make-up room Deni squeezed the orchid finger and walked to the other side of the hall. He also wanted to know what secrets Borak had said. He could make Sophia look like a lively, actually proud and conservative girl. So happy and enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes twitched slightly, "chasing" Sophia's swaying figure, and Lucine suddenly felt a real glow on his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight shifted, Lucien saw the old lady in the black dress staring at herself indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile, Lucien nodded and greeted him with a colder look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the temporary departure of Princess Sophia, the aristocratic children spread out in circles, and Lu Xien suddenly became cold and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if someone talks to him a few words, it is meaningless and perfunctory, comparing the bustling crowds around Alten, comparing their eager laughter, full Explain what is arrogant and what is frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting a cup of gold rum that Borak likes, Lucien tries to make himself look disdainful and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bolaq, you have changed a lot during this time." Just a sip of wine, the soft female voice came from the side, it was tall and plump, facial features Exquisite Jocelyn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked back at Alten and saw that he was being surrounded by a group of noble children in the middle of the hall, and smiled and said: "When things are already facing the desperate situation In time, we must know how to change. Only change can bring new hope. I have nothing to lose, and I will not be able to change myself if I change myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; ambiguous and with a bit of resentment, Lucien is quite satisfied with his play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If, I mean, if you were like this last year, then I won’t..." Jocellin sighed and said nothing. With two glasses of red wine left, the back is a bit stunned and lovable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien swayed the cup with the gold rum and watched the golden liquid inside reflect the fine mans, and sighed inside: "Unfortunately, I am not a blog." Lark. If you change to be him, after hearing this, you will go to the underground palace. Even if you have the strength, you may not be willing to hurt you." He didn't care whether Jocelyn really had a fake or not, but went to the underground palace anyway. How to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the glass and wandered in the banquet hall. Suddenly he saw a blonde wearing a black gauze evening gown, her eyes were blue and deep. It is similar to the profile of Borak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear cousin, I am very pleased to see you cheering up again." This beautiful woman toasted and touched Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled flatly: "Clair, I thought you would be grateful to have one opponent."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another heir to the contender, Claire? Fan? Anjou, the cousin of Borak, the official knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Cavaliers rank has nothing to do with men and women, in most human countries, women, especially female knights, have formal inheritance rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if you don't have a Borak, I will be stared at Alten, I am not his opponent." Claire smiled Lucien, tall and slender, very wonderful, "and he is too arrogant. If he wins, it is not good for us all. Although the empire does not have the winners of Shahran, I am worried that he will do little tricks. In comparison, I would rather be the title of the Earl of Goldeneye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?" Lucien laughed "all in control" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clair’s smile became flattering: “We unite each other’s forces and give Alten a lesson in the underground palace to get rid of this greatest danger. And then, depending on the strength, how about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lucien seems to care less about the subsequent competition, Claire’s heart sinks, does he really have an adventure? Have enough confidence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, she is also completely unspoken. When she lifts her body and leaves, her left hand extends, holding Lucien’s left hand, her fingers gently scratching her head. In the palm of my hand, the voice suddenly became hoarse: "No matter who wins in the end, we will not hinder us from having a good night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clair... "Lu Sien is a bit stunned." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clair smiled very much: "Don't be serious, Borak, you don't even let your father's mistress, what is the cousin? And we can't be married, as long as you can stimulate the blood of the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is the special blood that requires purer and better, so the birth of a close relative is common. This is the case, such as the Lafayette family in the Principality of Vaolirit, and there is a similar situation in the gorse family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Lucien, the smile on Claire’s face faded away, and a sneer appeared in the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at her back and smiled and shook her head. Although she didn’t know what she thought, she was totally different from the one they wanted. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another half lap and turned to the balcony, a blond man slammed over and signaled Lucien to go to the balcony to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ralph? What's the matter?" Lucien asked helplessly. This is another successor candidate, Ralph of the Gorse family, a handsome man, has not yet stimulated blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blowing the cold wind of the night, Ralph’s face was filled with exuberance: “Bolaq, I want to work with you to deal with Alten. He is too Strong, we don't unite, we can't see the hope of defeating him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's good. "Lu Sien is still an "unpredictable" attitude.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that your father is the youngest brother of the Duke, and I will definitely leave you with many extraordinary items. Or pharmacy, is it not my cooperation? "Feeling the attitude of Lucien, Ralph is somewhat sensitive and excited. "I have already inspired the 'Sun' blood! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You inspired the sun? Lucien was slightly surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relph looked back at the hall and turned to solemnly: "This is my biggest card, telling you to show me." Sincerity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, a ray of light appeared on his finger, confirming that he was able to perform magic.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's great to work with you. Our biggest rival is Alten, and then we can talk about each other's competition. "Lusien answered Relf with Claire's words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sober. I went advanced and could not be discovered by Alten. "Relph took a few steps and suddenly turned back and whispered. "Be careful, Claire, she seems to be involved with the royal family. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand. Lu Xien solemnly replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rerph just left, Lucien’s expression eased, he did not seem to rely on the blood when he applied magic Power!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great knight or the mid-level magician may not be able to distinguish, but as a high-ranking arcian, magician, member of the Arcane Review Committee, Lucien There is no way to distinguish between mental and blood spells in such a close distance, and the ones waiting for themselves will be the horror roar that the storm dominates.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You There are also secret people, Ralph. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head with a smile, but he didn't care too much about it, no matter what means, plans, conspiracy, etc. they entered the underground palace, themselves It is the rhythm of beating the children.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study of the gorse family, The old duke with a slightly gray hair is looking at the report in his hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
