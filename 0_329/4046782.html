			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your descendants have also died in the admiration of the demon incident? Why is the church not notified?" Katrina asked in a slightly surprised way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire is as "evil" as the magician, and the church can completely use him as the culprit of the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia swayed the red wine in his hand: "He was the descendant of the time I traveled to the Shahran Empire. It was a An excellent aristocrat, so when the church confirmed the identity of the vampire from the body, the nobles put pressure on the church to conceal the matter, so as not to destroy the image of the nobility. Anyway, the "evil" magician bears everything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case, did you find any clues to Mr. Viscount?" Katrina nodded lightly, eliminating the inner doubts. Asked in anticipation, I hope that the vampire viscount who also finds the cemetery can have more clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia is lazily leaning against the trunk, and there is no vampire to look at the image: "Although I can sense the death of my descendants from a distance, But I can't confirm which descendant, so when I collect good information, most of the valuable clues are long gone, maybe there is not much information you have investigated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you checked the knight's body? What sealed blood is he?" Katrina asked, opening the grave with magic, but did not give up the most The basic alert, "acquaintance" to "acquaintance" does not mean that the danger is ruled out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am really good at identifying the traces on the body." Katrina, a Viscount of Karendia, asked the right person, then slightly Shake his head. "You can also have a body to let me check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina snorted: "Do you mean there are no bodies in the grave?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave was opened, the coffin slowly floated out under the power of magic, and then the black cover turned to one side. It reveals the interior of the coffin with only a few aristocratic clothing and an ashes jar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can think of this corpse with problems. How can people who admire the demon gatherings think about it? According to the information I have heard, although the nobility will press this matter Down, but the vampire and the demon admirer dual status makes them dare not care, so first 'flame purification', then buried." The prince Karenardia bathed under the silver moon, his face slightly dark and uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a dual identity as a vampire and a demon admirer? The knight seems to be a descendant of the Viscount of Karen Erdia... Katrina thought secretly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I checked his family and found no suspicious places. He is also a close-knit person in the aristocratic circle, in the days of knights and cardinals. Under the protection of the . We want to check one by one is not realistic. It is better to sneak into the referee to find the investigation record of the church." Viscount Kareldia said a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very similar to my "intention". Katrina whispered: "I can apply to the parliament for assistance from a high-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can ask your father what to help, they should It is a powerful vampire of the Earl and Duke level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my descendant, before there is no real danger. My "parent" must personally investigate the murderer." Karendia The Viscount is rare and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents...Looking at the young and handsome face of Viscount Kareldia and the dazzling blond hair, Katrina suddenly has a sense of ridiculousness, these long lives The race is really amazing, like a high-ranking magician who has prolonged his life and kept his youth. If nothing unexpected, they can see the grandson of the grandson of his grandson’s grandson... This is for her in her twenties. unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" During this time, I started by investigating the magician who died here, looking for someone he had contacted, but someone saw him except for some transactions. When I am taking risks and doing things. No one has ever seen him, and I don’t know who he is acting with. He must have hidden his appearance. Do you know what clues you have?” The Viscount Kareldia asked himself. The purpose of the appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina thought about it, he was alone in this place, although Heidi’s latest research results, but the city of Calcutt as the northern province The third largest city, with its own strength or victory, there are many, the Knights of the day and the cardinal also have a few, more than a helper is more sure, so she took the intelligence she got from Yakov The focus is on the Viscount Kareldia, and other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, the Duda is often mysterious and belongs to the suspicion of the Viscount Kareldia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So far, most of the clues have been broken, and only two or three of them are pointing to Sir Duda. Maybe we should find a chance to visit." 'Look at him, Katrina, do you want to be together?” Viscount Kareldia had a familiar look, affectionately calling the name of Katrina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina smiled shallowly: "I originally wanted to invite Mr. Viscounts, but Sir Duda lived in the villas of the noble area. In the same place, the villa of the Count of Calcutt and the villa of the Knights of the Knights are very close, we are afraid to wait for another opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will always go out of town. The Viscount Kareldia had a little drink of red wine, a wave of his right hand, and a black cloak behind him, like a pair of bat wings. "When I come, I invite you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have integrated into the darkness, constantly climbing, and finally left a slight laughter and humorous words: "There are big people behind him, we don't have it, maybe bigger and more abnormal, huh..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More perverted..." Katrina subconsciously repeated a sentence, then looked around and patted her chest, "almost followed him with metamorphosis Describe the teacher, but the teacher is not here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed Soon, in Yakov worried and looking forward to the mood, he received the Knight's Chi Feng, has become a jazz Yakov, get a piece of territory on an estate outside the city and wilderness, so. He packed up and led Anna and other subordinates to the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister Katrina, you really don't follow us in the past?" Anna looked like a tearful eye, and she couldn't bear the friend of her sister. When her mother died, she was very lacking in the care of older women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov screamed and stuttered: "Actually, you have to find a place to live in Katrina, and you have to pay for living in a hotel." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina shook her head with a smile: "In the past few days, I have found several partners who have ventured together to the bottom of the wilderness, so I will act with them." I am very interested in your kindness. When the adventure is over, I will visit you at the manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, it should be an official farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister Katrina, have you found a new companion? Why don't I know?" Anna asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you been busy in the past few days, how can you know?" Katrina and Reyia are both patient and thoughtful. Therefore, it will shine on the study of the nature of materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, you are in the condition of Katrina's sister. There is absolutely no need to venture to get wealth. Many people want to give it to you." Anna half jokingly Said help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina smiled and licked her long blond hair: "It’s very easy, but it’s not what I want, only what I really master. It’s its own. It’s going to be more practical, and it’s going to go further.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s shunning the attitude of the Arcane research to disappoint Anna’s words. Suggestions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister Katrina, you are so esoteric..." Anna licked her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really esoteric things you haven't seen yet... Katrina remembers the Evans field equation, the Lucien equation, and remembers the wonders of microscopic particles. Characteristics, a moment of emotion, this is the most advanced field of arcane, but to really understand their arcane masters, it is estimated that there is none, even the teacher said that he often struggles, said if not for micro The field and quantum mechanics are confused and confused. Then no one has studied them with care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she suddenly felt that she had a deep gap with friends like Anna, and she could not integrate into their lives, and they could not understand their own research. Everything else, other book friends are watching: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending away Yakov and Anna, Katrina picked up things, retired the hotel room and blended into the crowds on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
