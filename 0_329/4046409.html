			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and delicate, like a toy, the balance swayed up and down, and the white tray was on it for a while, and then it was changed to black, and after two or three times, it was balanced. Ten meters around Bayer exudes an inexplicable feeling of strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope of a blue-colored wind that was entangled in his body collapsed without any warning, and the large spider web that stepped on his feet disappeared without a trace. The twisted magnetic field around is as calm as never appearing, and Denny shines the electric light and thunder snake. It seems that the long sword that Raytheon punishes has faded all kinds of glitz, revealing the original metallic luster, and the star of Alten’s body is silently broken. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia six standing in the middle of the hall with the white wings moving with the fan, a cloud containing the power of death is just floating around Bayer and disappears instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni's delicate face, his teeth clenched his lips, and the power of lightning that he is proud of seems to be no longer inductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scope of the order balance, all extraordinary powers return to order! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity to get rid of the bounds of Bayer, never had the ease, raised the green "Devil's Horn" sword, said: "Come on Let me see what you guys killed me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On a big knight who piled up on items?" Bayer flashed Alten's side like a space shuttle, and the long sword slammed from the top right to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the power of the order balance is consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten Shield moves forward, trying to block Bayer’s slashing, but just in contact with the green long sword, Bayer in front of him flaps with the wings Left a shadow, leaving the shield's interception empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good! Alten starred long sword back, blocked behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, Juli came, Alten stumbled and stumbled, and could no longer maintain the balance, and he would be blinded by Bayer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dazzling silver electric awning, Deni gang Alten with both hands holding a sword blocked a fatal blow, and I took a few steps back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the basis of a big knight who has not touched the knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ber The war is full, the speed is extremely fast, and after a few squats, it will be entangled with Deni. The light flashing green between the swords will always make Deni have the feeling of weakening and slowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of ghosts left in the small area, so that Sophia is completely unable to lock Bayer, fearing that he will accidentally injure Denny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has flashed a few suitable magics in her mind, she can’t do it because it belongs to the force field, the change system, etc., not her blood power. The scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sorrow of the warlock. What kind of magic can be used depends only on the blood of the birth, and has nothing to do with his own efforts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangdang’s long swords are almost in a series. Suddenly, Bayer got out of the fight with a flash, letting Denney rush, and he quickly flashed to the top of Sophia, and his sword volleyed in both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the basis of a newly promoted five-level warlock?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer is warlike The drink asked, and Sophia was shocked and could not jump with the wind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green long sword smashed the shield of the blue wind surrounded by Sophia, and instantly made it appear a crevice, and the inch collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short-term obstacle allowed Arten to come over and waved his sword to block Bayer’s follow-up attack. Sophia also took the opportunity to step back and reinvigorate the flag. drum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lifting the bond, Bayer is awe-inspiring, and with only one person, Sofia, Denis, Alten can’t breathe and even take time. Killing a nobleman who besieged Claire, let her pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next to the Ralph looked thrilling, hands clasped unconsciously, did not notice the calm of Lucian, let Lucien quietly groan, this goods are not forgotten to learn to cast spells? In comparison, Sophia in the battle is very calm, without any fluctuations and panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fought in battle, Lucien didn’t even think about joining the fight between the children, while watching, they continued to crack the secret room and planned to sneak into this opportunity. Inside the underground palace, open the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the place that passed before, and the layout of this hall, Lucien has already figured out that the secret room is nearby! However, the specific location has yet to be further cracked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you dare to kill me with a few of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bail's battle Like a thunder, a series of attacks made Dennie and Alten retreat, occupying a clear upper hand, and between the long swords, Sophia tried to restrain his "wind rope" again into a breeze. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophia saw such a scene and quietly stepped back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the approximate scope of the Chamber of Secrets, Lucien’s calculations were more and more accurate and he quickly got the specific location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's there!" Lucien looked at a light gray stone brick in the center of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a foot wearing a beautiful riding boots stepped on the stone bricks, slamming and pressing hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sophia?" Lucien saw her master along the foot, and Sophia stepped back a few steps just to the entrance to the secret room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull sound came from the bottom of the hall, and the stone wall next to it was distorted and transformed into a quaint gate, which slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the sudden appearance of the secret room, Ralf is not surprised, but quite surprised, it is not clear why the Royal Highness Princess will choose this time to open the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bail, Deni, Alten and others who are in war are not distracted and continue to concentrate on fighting, but Bayer is more and more brave and seems to want to change. Before, the two big knight enemies will be shackled under the sword to avoid worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among the ancient villas of the gorse family, Ulrich The Duke and others have noticed the strange changes in the underground palace, but the dark door in front of them refuses anyone's entry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forcibly breaking! If the prince and the princess are dying inside, the wrathful emperor will do anything that no one can guess, maybe it is us. The end of the gorse family!” The back of the Count of Nuremberg slammed into the dark and deep scenes, and countless faint stars were running in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his wave, the countless stars lie on the dark door, making a violent explosion of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palace of a legendary magician is so good to break! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another count is also cooperating with him, and angry at the same time: "If I find out which bastard is doing it, I will definitely peel off him." Skin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an exaggeration and scolding, he will really peel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the "blood scorpion" Count Wolfgang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does 'Glory Crown' not sway the core of the control of the underground palace, open the magical array?" The Duke of the gorse, Ulrich, gloomy face, look The dark door was not rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nurenbeck and others suddenly stagnate and look at Ulrich: "You mean, Lord Midalun is involved in this matter? Many aristocratic children, and the heirs of our family, is he crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't there still be several heirs who didn't go in?" Ulrich His eyes are gloomy and his voice is low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulrich shook his head: "Continue, do your best! If he succeeds, the whole bet will be the entire gorse family. If he fails, we will not know it beforehand, and we will try our best to rescue it. At most, he is That is the wrath of the emperor who killed him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, bring your 'assistant', he is a high-level magician, than our approach Many, really can't do it, you can only ask the emperor to kneel down. We can't alarm other legends, we must control the impact of things to a minimum!" Nurembe looked sideways at Ulrich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other golden knight of the gorse family accepted the mission of Rudolf II and went to the alien space controlled by the Empire, but as a descendant of the Sun King, Hundreds of hidden books are enough to attract a lot of ancient heritage magicians to come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulrich solemnly bowed to promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quaint stone door slowly opens and makes a heavy tie Zaza sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucienk has taken the impulse to go in now, who knows if Midarun is in the secret room, but at this time, a strong bloody smell It floated out from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Lucien is more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dozen seconds, Ralph also found that it was wrong, twitching his nose, and wondering: "Is there a lot of blood inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia seems to be unaware of her efforts to fight with Deni, Alten and Bayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the gates is getting bigger and bigger, and Lu Xien and others clearly see the scene in the secret room: the blood of a beach and a pool is splashed with walls, splashed There is a painting of the strong family of the gorse, and under the blood of the demon, the ground is filled with countless pieces of meat, bones, and some even embedded in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire secret room is like a slaughterhouse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flesh and bones, standing on a road, Sean is quite familiar with the black figure, his body is itchy like a twist, then it feels like a ray of light Turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a pale face, but it is covered with a raised red blood vessel, which is very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the hall and laughed: "Bolaq, I became a Knight of Heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I became a Knight of Heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally became a Knight of Heaven!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Shocked by this extremely horrible scene, the battles of Bayer, Deni, Claire and others stopped subconsciously and looked at the strange and strange man with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frederick?" Lucien recognized him as a former secret guard of Borak. Is he here? At this time, Sophia smiled: "Yes, you become a Knight of Heaven, you will get everything you deserve, such as the title of the Duke of the Gorse, For example, infinite wealth, such as a princess like me as a wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am a knight, I can get before I dare to go All the good things I want! Your Royal Highness, my wife, tell me, why are you frowning?" Frederick laughed like a madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Smell" to a strange and familiar "taste" of Lucian, suddenly produced an inexplicable idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's him, he wants to kill me!" Sophia pointed at Bayer and was so weeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frederick "Oh" said: "It was the prince of the prince, killing you, can I become an emperor?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit seems to be very confusing, talking upside down, and even taking time to laugh at Lucien, "Thank you for your greedy ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
