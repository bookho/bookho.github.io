			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June 25, the sun is shining, bright as Natasha is in the mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a light tone in her mouth, taking care of her looks and clothing against the full-length mirror, because it’s not a rookie without emotional experience, a similar date in and There were many times when Via got along, and there was no problem in knowing her own name. Skirts, wide-brimmed hats, earrings, necklaces, etc. were not excluded, so it was easy to pick out a fine black dress with fine workmanship. The skirt is slightly fluffy, revealing the mystery of the night and the temptation of the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it won't be too flattering, it will swear by my style, scare Lucien, and it won't be too hard and loses charm like a knight suit. Natasha moved around and said with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This court dress is not a conservative Holm style, nor an open Tria style, but an elegant Al in between The style of the tray is slightly lower, and you can see a delicate white skin. If you don't bend over, you won't reveal any places that shouldn't be exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dress of the long skirt is very clever, showing Natasha’s long, graceful neck, full and firm chest, and slender and powerful waist in the most moving way. Come out, full of the charm of the female surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked up and down and whispered to herself: "Before Sylvia often envied my body, not too thin, nor Will be overweight, Lucien will be amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not have confidence in herself, but gave up the "Lusien name conversion plan" that day. After recollecting the past, I found that I had never tried to exude the charm of the female surname when I was with Lucien. I don’t know if his image is a girl or a gentleman in his eyes, so I want to be the shortest time. Corrected the "bad" impression of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Natasha can never retreat because of this little thing. After she has the goal, she has always been determined to move forward. Solve and make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge, Lucien’s magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese dish on the table in the living room, but the fragrance is not overflowing, because all the fresh magic is applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took off the apron when cooking, and walked to the full-length mirror with a light music, carefully looked at himself: "Well, follow the plan." Acting, slightly change the style of the jacket, give Natasha a new feeling, be sure to reverse the image of a good friend that was formed before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black double-breasted long dress is slow Slowly creeping, it turned into a black long trench coat with a white shirt and a black vest, and a neckline with a casual bow tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same color trousers are straight, slightly covering the bright black shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men’s dress is not as complicated as a lady, but it’s just a change in the coat, so that the feeling of Lucien’s giving has changed significantly. It used to be quiet and calm to conservative. The men now have a bit more radiant and cool and cool, coupled with their self-confident and calm temperament, more and more shaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear the monocle, Lucien took care of the sea, let it slant from the left to the right, slightly blocking the eyebrows above the right eye . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finished up, looking at the mirror in the handsome Sven, the hair grows to the ear of his own, Lu Xien slightly frowned, not enough masculine, not enough men, The heart secretly thought: "Is it necessary to make the hair into a head, and then leave two mustaches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea just started, Lu Xien suddenly woke up, Funnyly talking to himself: "Natasha's aesthetic should be more biased here. If you go to the direction of a masculine man, it will definitely be counterproductive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Turning around, the dish was fixed with magic, and it was placed in a storage bag that was rewarded as a high-ranking magician. Suddenly, he was screaming at the busy moment, and he was glad that he almost forgot. Then he hurryed. Go to the table at the bar counter in the living room, pick up a mint, peel off the package, and throw it into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep your breath fresh." Lucien smiled and said an ad, then made a fist to the "self" in the mirror:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is very satisfied with her appearance, almost no makeup, just changed the hairstyle, let the long hair of the scatter Divided into charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing her clothes, she used to naturally get a few different flavors of sugar from the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which taste would be better?" Natasha hesitated, considering Lucine’s preferences, so she picked a sweet but not greasy Violet sugar, peeled off, containing the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared, Natasha was just about to go out and start the Cavaliers’ journey. I suddenly remembered a long time ago: “Silvia once said When she saw her, she stared at her legs and looked at her stockings like a wolf. Well, although Lucien explained that she did not expect the musicians to have such alchemy by-products, it was a bit sloppy. But this kind of thing, I would rather believe that he likes it, and he doesn't want to be prepared at any time. Anyway, he won't be disgusted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the tone again, Nata Sha opened the closet and didn't hesitate to pick a pair of black stockings with the color of the clothes and a garter of the same color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit on the couch, Natasha retired her right foot from the black shoes and leaned over to the coffee table. Her feet are slightly more delicate than her height, with a beautiful arc, slightly fleshy, long and lovely toes, and no nails on the nails. It is a healthy and charming pink, like a five-petal rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll up the thin stockings and put them on the toes. The black ones cover the skin a little and cover the long, straight right legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the right foot is the left foot, Natasha buckles up the garter, stands up again, pulls up the skirt, checks the effect, legs under the black stockings Indistinct, fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s good to be a knight, and the legs that used to look too strong are just right, haha.” Natasha was not ashamed at all, and praised herself with great blunt words. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, she looked at the full-length mirror and looked at the beautiful woman, with a little nervousness and worry on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such an emotion was quickly removed by her high-spirited fighting spirit and firm eyes. Natasha made a fist in her right hand and pointed at the "self" in the mirror: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha, you can do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face is smiling, coming out of the living room, and going nervously outside the magic tower, I don’t know when it’s coming up. Natasha's Poems (Adapted by Waterside's Adilina). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the lift, Lucien looked around and saw the garden outside the huge floor-to-ceiling window. He suddenly felt a move: "Oops, no flowers! The important things are forgotten, and no experience really hurts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the time, Lucien found himself difficult to find elsewhere, so he would pay attention I hit my own garden: "Well, I can still use my hard work to cultivate, and I have been cared for for years, and I have more sincerity than buying from others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp [&nbsp; comforting himself, Lucien left the lift, flew down the window, and then hesitated without hesitation, directly selected the violet - this is the impression Natasha has in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, here is the sky, the flowering period has not yet passed, or else you have to use magic to rush." ​​Lucien does not know Natasha's flowers. How is the senses, so only ten of them were taken into a bundle and they were stored in storage bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to think about any other omissions, Lucien once again sorted out the clothes and walked out of the magic tower, then Sprint, Catri Na, Annick and other students came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, where are you going? Isn't your oysters tonight? We are planning to help you celebrate together." Heidi asked lively and strangely. Dao, how do the teachers today feel weird, and even the styles of clothes that have not changed throughout the year have changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t think that he would meet them, some awkwardly said: “I have agreed with other friends, you will come back tomorrow night.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien asked for it, and quickly got on the carriage and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you don't let me ask?" Heidi looked puzzled at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most experienced Che Li laughed and said: "You didn't find the teacher's spring coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;啊? Still, the bachelor's Sprint and Annick said that they don't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking in the carriage to the Royal Tower of Holm, Natasha I entered the former living room with Camille without squinting, and hurriedly met many royal members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she took a deep breath and said to Camille: "Aunt Camille, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make it like a battlefield, relax a little." Camille saw Natasha arrogant, a domineering look, and quickly soften her, do not arouse the counter-effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." Natasha nodded and understood that she was too attached, a bit stiff, so she hangs a faint smile and walks to the same level. The "Lu Xien Office" gently rang the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No waiting, screaming, the door opened, Natasha’s eyes suddenly lit up, such a road is really rare, and fresh means To some extent, the unknown is more attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stunned, never seen such a bright and beautiful woman, Natasha full of female surname, as she imagined . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is very satisfied with Lucien’s expression and smiles: “Don’t you ask me to go in?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned to God, let the road open, and exposed the room in the hustle and bustle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, on the left is a lounge with a bed, on the right is a study, the corner of the living room is set with a piano, and in the middle is a round table, above the round table. With a plate of carefully decorated unique food and two candlesticks, the dim candlelight staggered, bringing out a romantic and romantic atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, who used to eat dinner under candlelight, never thought that just a slight change would make the ordinary and common environment so fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien led her to the table, opened the chair, asked the lady to sit first, then picked up the red wine in the ice, and fell one person Half a cup, then sat back to the opposite seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After knowing for eight years, I am finally able to celebrate my oysters with you." Lucien said with a glass of wine, and he began to figure out the next step. The plan: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First guide the topic to the meaningful things that have been experienced together in the past, let Natasha feel touched, and the feelings are soft, then play Playing the piano, maximizing the atmosphere, deepening her feelings, and then hinting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha also picked up the glass, with Lucien touched it and smiled. "Unconsciously, you are twenty-five years old, happy and happy, Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;叮After the crisp sound, the two men each took a sip of red wine, and Lu Xien took the opportunity to revisit the plan again, revealing a gentle smile and preparing to guide the topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Natasha stood up and said with a smile: "I have an oyster gift for you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What gift?" Lucien looked at Natasha gracefully toward herself, and quickly recalled another branch, how to deal with the branch after receiving the oyster gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A faint scent of scent comes out, and Lucien’s mouth is open, and he must express his happiness and praise Natasha’s gift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien saw Nata bending down and holding her chin in her right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
