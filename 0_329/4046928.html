			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Sami hurriedly turned around, but the head seemed to be slow, and looked at the room, and Downey behind him looked at the house number. Then, the two hit a full face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, how do you know that you have gone wrong without looking at the house number? Or you have been to your own bedroom once, this time simply looking at the room. The arrangement knows that you have gone wrong? But you still carry your luggage in your hand! Hey, there is a symbiotic ghost behind you! This is a very special soul phenomenon, which has important reference value for us to unravel the specific structure of the soul. ..." There was a magnetic male voice in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This familiar voice, this seemingly unstoppable words, like lightning flashing across the sky, hit Donnie, let him stay in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he is actually his roommate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don's mind suddenly popped up a picture, surrounded by dozens of hundreds of knights, dozens of Gauss rifles pointed at the head, in the air It is a scene that can be elementized into a tide, sun, lightning and other scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This terrible picture makes Downey’s body tremble slightly. Although Carl is cheerful and welcoming, it does not mean that the knights who protect him are the same, maybe they are casual. An action can cause an overreaction, and Carl may not be as confused as it is! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small, miss, see you, I still don't understand if I am going wrong?" Sami said with a red face, because of the relationship behind the spirit, He has no woman's fate since childhood, so when he is facing a female classmate, he is either in a situation of eager sleep, and gets along with him. Either quite awkward and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is Miss! I am a man of righteousness, a knight who protects the ladies and ladies, is an arcade master who explores the path of truth, and I am like a woman. Child!" Carl's voice became slightly angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smuggling and nervous Sami blurted out: "Where are you not like girls...唔唔..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The words were not finished, his mouth was held down by Downey, for fear that he would provoke Karl's anger, let himself and him be set by fire, and then buried in the "Nongmong Cemetery" outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie showed a slightly flattering smile, his head to the side, looking at Carl through the gap between Sami and the door frame: "Karl. For a long time... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice came to an abrupt end. The mouth forgot to close, and looked at Karl inside, like a stone sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Carl wears the standard robes of the Heidel School of Magic, and the dark black color lining his skin like snow. Loose pleats cover the body without bumps. Plus exquisite and pure looks. Because it is a little angry and bright and bright, the silver-purple eyes are completely a flawless beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This classic robes of the college has one of the most obvious features, that is, regardless of men and women! This made Karl's usual male style, such as men's wear and bow tie, disappear. It looks no different from other female students. It is no wonder that Sami will bow down and apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly, Donnie came up with an idea, and every day with Carl, when they face other girls, will they feel that they are all Too ordinary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you, you... Donnie?" Carl continued "you" several times, finally remembering Downey's name, and then he married Hey, "You are also my roommate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint redness on his face's fair skin becomes bright, the bright double-bend sharp, the majestic momentum Let the ghost behind Sami huddle again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey stepped back and looked at Carl blankly, and the thoughts in his mind were "dangerous", "falling to the ground", "why would be angry" and other ideas. However, after Carl quickly looked around for four weeks, the silver-purple eyes immediately faded sharply, and once again smiled like flowers and said: "We turned out to be roommates, it's a coincidence! Is this your friend? Also our roommate? At the beginning I originally wanted to apologize after the end of the exam. However, there was a small accident in the afternoon exam. I had to leave early. I couldn’t think of you when I first came to the college. Are you also in the direction of physical structure and genetic factors? Then we are probably still classmates..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am a real man!" Carl said triumphantly, raising his arm. "Would you like to try my strength, Donnie also knows I can make a big effort. I can beat five of you in a punch. Hey, I am joking. My strength is just general..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami Bitterly said: "I believe, believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen Carl’s throat, panic and calm, and feels like the world from Downey. Deeply malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, we will be roommates in the future, we must love each other, help each other, make progress together, and go further in the exploration of heredity and mystery of the soul... ..." Karl's right hand pressed the chest, slightly squatting, his left hand stretched out, pointing to the room, an elegant gentleman's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he have so many words, and serious and officially like a news anchor... Downey wiped the sweat, no longer seeing Carl’s and any A beautiful face is beautiful, I am afraid that I will be "eyes low" in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bedroom at the Heidler School of Magic is not gorgeous, but it is very clean and clean. Four beds made of ferrous metal are placed next to the walls, each in front Personal desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desk is made of bright yellow wood, divided into two levels, with a shelf above it, and a door near the rear locker that seems to open to the balcony and bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a home TV at the door, everyone’s bedside has its own magic refrigerator for storing food and drinks, right, the two on the bed. A small piece of metal is a 'magic radio' that plugs into your ear, so you don't disturb other people when you listen to 'Mystery Sound' at night, but there is no magic air conditioner, because the whole Heidler School of Magic is wrapped in a magical array, the temperature is Up and down in a range, neither cold nor hot, magic air conditioning is of course unnecessary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie just dragged the suitcase Before going to an empty bed, Karl's magnetic voice was heard in the ear. He introduced the contents of the room in detail and thoughtfully, and the way he was happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does he rarely have a chance to speak? Unlike him, who is the big man in his background, who will limit his speech?" Downey’s heart emerged A strange idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, there are no instruments such as piano, violin, and flute. You can't use a magic phonograph or a magic sound machine. In fact, I have a lot of music I like. You share, I also have some creations myself..." Carl seems to be a little disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Sound Recorder is an improvement of the phonograph, which can carry more music and is more portable. More convenient to use. The corresponding record is also cheaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The back of the door is a balcony, the left side of the balcony is the bathroom, there is no kitchen, there is no living room. There is no floor-to-ceiling window..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time. Downey’s neighboring Sami seems to be a little intolerant of a male voice that is a magnetic beauty. So I took care of the bird's nest-like hair: "Donnie, change the magic robe, we have to choose the course and the tutor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha. I was yesterday I just finished the election." Carl did not consciously interject, "How? Do you want me to introduce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be asking, but immediately Said: "Our body structure and genetic factors are the best instructors, of course, Mr. Felipe, but he is also the director of the genetic laboratory, long-term in the forefront of the field of necromantics, not much time, only occasionally talk about a few Regarding the open class of difficult or cutting-edge knowledge, the rest of the teachers are good at each other, such as..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie Head: "We are coming late, we must Time, or else you will miss today's class, Carl, let's wait, let's talk while we walk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that the School of Magic is a public choice. Going late, the course with a good tutor is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him a bit blame on Heidler College. It is said that other colleges are all students who choose after they arrive, but here they are selected according to the order of arrival, but This is indeed in line with the cold image that the Necromancer has always given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
