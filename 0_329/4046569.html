			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are so many magical magics, Lucien has enough reassurance about the drinks he has checked. I don’t think this kind of relief is deadly today. Vulnerabilities, unknowingly drank a cup of "sky blue" mixed with horrible toxins and quirky curses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not just drinks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s gaze looked to Camille as a ninth-level knight to protect Natasha, she would not drink a little on this occasion. She ate half a bite of food, but she still turned black and her body trembled uncontrollably. She wanted to incarnate the "tidal" but only floated a layer of blue water, and then disappeared without any trace, showing obvious poisoning and cursing symptoms. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the source of toxins and curses? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s nose suddenly smelled a light and sweet floral fragrance, just like the taste of an open-air banquet, but it was lighter, sweeter and more intoxicating. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flower has a problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be guilty or who is being used, bringing in the smell of this kind of flower, and the wine and wine that have been moved in advance. The gas is mixed, so that the wine and the air have become unimaginable poison and curse. No wonder they did not find it during the inspection! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to find out who is guilty or accomplices, Lucien swaying and walking towards Natasha, the foreground is blurry, as if It’s so uncomfortable to get drunk, not only can’t concentrate, but even the hands and feet are a little floating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lucien has the ring of Congos, which has solved the poison, not like Camille, James, etc., in the head of the wood, like drunk In addition, the body is also weak and weak, and it is difficult to support itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the Earl of Pine, who did not inspire the power of the Knights, fell to the ground, his limbs spread out, no power, his eyes blurred, and he fell into a "hangover" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s body still maintains strength and slowly moves closer to Natasha as a drunken fist, if he is not mistaken in his heavy brain and soul now,” The sword of truth, the top blood that can cut everything, is an immune curse, so Natasha should be poisoned at this time, the body quickly sheds power, and the mind and consciousness are still sober, just let her wear a "healthy belt" ", to stimulate the role of this item, then her toxins will soon be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eight-level high-level magic item is also the following toxins of immune legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Ring of Congus, Lucien wouldn’t use it even if she wanted to get Natasha. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, there is a sound of falling, the second poorest Earl of David is as soft as the Earl of Pine, but his consciousness is not completely Into the "drunk" state, anxiously and nervously moving his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a curse from the lungs, from the stomach to the neck, extending upwards, affecting the brain and soul of Lucien, which makes him The head swells, the heart beats faster, the forehead and blood vessels seem to be blasted at any time, and the mental power is oppressed to support, and it is impossible to use a magic to stimulate an item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to Natasha, Lucien took off his belt and wrapped it around her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s voice is low, it seems to be very difficult to talk: “I can’t concentrate on the will... hard to use magic items, you, you go, goal, goal It should be me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to have not heard her words, hands clasped around her waist, buckled the healthy belt, tongue hair wooden tunnel : "Try to control ... will... The role of toxins has not yet played... Completely... There should be a chance... Start magic items..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Na Tasha didn't waste time, and she didn't give up. The clear silver and purple eyes contained strong and hard to control her will, and at the same time she urged again: "Go fast, you still have strength... speed... go find outside Aristocrats... ask for help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, at least Lucien will not follow himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the crisp applause came from the door: "It’s really a moving pair, I hope you will be together forever after you die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;路Sean looked up and saw that there was a strange man with dark green hair in his door. There was no pupil in his eyes. There was only a heart-rending white, and his body was also very weird. The hot days were still draped. A black cloak that wraps the whole body up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a 30-year-old strange man who pressed his chest and politely performed a gentleman's ceremony: "My Majesty the Queen, please allow me to introduce myself. I am the 'venom devil' of the Dark Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Venom Devil" Piri Mas, the 62nd Powerhouse of the Purification Sequence The Nine Dark Knights, the demon kings, are famous for their toxins and curses. Although they rank lower than Lucien, their strength is undoubtedly above Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not answer him, concentrated on the will, and Lucien also used the spirit to counter the power of the curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas did not immediately start, but sneaked into the ground: "I don't know me? It doesn't matter, just know that I am coming to kill you." The parliament has been waiting for the Southern Church and the Magic Council to go on a full battle for a long time. I have lost patience for a long time. After knowing that the Queen has chosen the balance, the old man sent me over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be influenced by the bloodline of his own demon king, as if he feels that the winner is in the grip, so it seems a bit nervous, and the behavior is quite chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just kill the Queen and kill you, kill Lucien? Mr. Evans, kill the Duke of James, and pretend to be the hands of the radical vigil. It’s hard for the church and the magic parliament to start a full war. Right, I forgot to tell you that I am very good at simulating, especially good at knights who simulate toxins and cursing blood, while the night watchman is ranked fifth as 'curse angel' Gewell. I think I have enough power to let the legendary magician and the priest of the Holy Spirit believe that he is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the nerves of his nerves, Lucien and Natasha has seized the opportunity to drive away the curse or toxins in the body, but it seems that as time goes by, the more they play, the more difficult it is for both to stand. The difference is that Lucien is head-expanding. Straight, Natasha is weak in limbs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas seems to be unaware of the efforts of the two, and does not care that the Duke of James and others are unable to answer because they have no power, and continue to say: "In order to kill you, I spent a lot of energy, controlled a lot of attendants and gardeners, and changed the plant species in the garden slightly. If you are the true love of the Duke of James, you should have discovered it wrong. Unfortunately, you just like to show off, so when you enter the secret room with the floral fragrance, the harmless little things in the wine will be violent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In order not to arouse the will of your will and the hunch of the destiny of the fate, I did not use the fierce and deadly toxins and curses, but instead used the degenerate and paralyzed, the effect looks very good, which makes me have enough Time comes from outside the bounds of your will of James Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words confirm Lucian’s conjecture and seem to rule out the possibility of guilt . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this kind of thing, how can Lucien believe in his crazy guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, do you think that I am like a madman, actually don't do it, chat with you here, give you enough time to eliminate toxins and curses?" Limas suddenly laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked and seemed to think of something, but the curse of the brain from his neck made his brain congested, slow thinking, difficult to be as usual That is sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas laughed and said: "My mixture of toxins and curses is called 'powerless kiss'. The longer the time drags, the weaker it is, so I want you to listen to my embarrassment for the absolute grasp of the hands, and you are very cooperative, I am very pleased."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished, he shot Start with: "Pour! Down! Down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪,啪,啪, three consecutive sounds, Duke Russell and Camille fall down, eyes There was a trace of despair in the hatred, followed by the Golden Knight James Duke also staggered on his knees, as if his feet could not support his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien quietly stepped forward and groaned in his mind, and he was caught in an unprecedented state of chaos. There was only one thought in his mind, that is, he was in front of Natasha, but the long-established plan of family name made him still grasp one. The possibility of defeating victory is to lure Pi Limas close, to be unprepared, to attack with his left hand, and hope that the ineffectiveness of this "left hand of God" can make the supernatural power of his nine-level dark knight disappear. Really hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas whispered: "This time not only kills people, it seems to be able to harvest a lot of things, Mr. Evans, you are rare. The 'moving treasure' with so many magical items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently untied the cloak, revealing a body that makes people have nightmares, it is a long The body covered with abscesses, or the pale yellow or dark green pus, squirming bubbles, they corrode everything, leaving only a few pieces of cloth left in the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, please die!" Pirismus moved, and Lucien couldn’t capture his figure, let alone use his left hand. Attacked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he really started the attack, he didn’t care about it at all. He completely looked at Lucien’s current classmates, so although his melee strength is obviously not as good. Normal nine, but not Lucien can now compete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang, a group of pale yellow and dark green figures flashed to Lucien, slamming his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that even the air can be poisoned to make Lucien’s head heavier, his left hand raised, but unable to keep up with the speed of Limas, chest pass It was a great pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, Lucien disappeared and then slammed into the shadow of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spell trigger" This pre-prepared magic saved Lucien's life at a critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I forgot Mr. Evans, you are a magician. I think you shouldn’t be able to escape this time?" Deliberately ridiculed Lucien, once again figured up, and it was almost unimaginable to rush to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien barely raised his left hand as he was in the chest, but the figure of Pirimas disappeared in front of him and flashed to his back. The ankle entangled his vest, the pale yellow curse and the dark green toxin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, the dull sound, the three layers of gray skin that Lu Xien’s body suddenly emerged are pieces broken, and the immortal throne robes also have obvious gaps. And Lucien was kicked and flew to Natasha, and the blood was spurted in the mouth, and the back was extremely painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the eight-ring "skill sequencing" learned a few days ago, three constant four-ring magic "stone skin surgery" was pre-constant, and Lucien was down. It is very likely to die directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not dead yet? So I hate the magician the most!" Pirimas became a bit violent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James and others lying on the ground wondered how Lucien escaped the second wave of Pirimes and tried to concentrate on his will. But the results are minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilimas suddenly turned into a dark green spear and stabbed to Lucien, who had fallen to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien finally turned around with his hands and feet out of control, and saw such a scene, wanting to use magic to resist, but the spirit can not be condensed, cursed by the power Death suppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it going to die here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of Lucien, a long sword, a void, and blocked the spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the power of the spear is so horrible, through the long sword, directly through her body, warm blood sprinkled on the belly of Lucien, Chest and face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha..." Lucien said subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s cheeks showed abnormal flushing, and the hole between the chest and abdomen was difficult to recover due to the influence of toxins. A large amount of blood was quickly lost, and both feet were obvious. Trembling, as if a little unable to stand still, but her voice is low and firm:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
