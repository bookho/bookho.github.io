			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" It’s not El, but the good believer, disguised as Hughes, and he’s suppressing danger now. The situation that the storm is about to pour down is full of worry. Even if the great El God has awakened himself, the enemy is no longer a relatively weak moon god Asin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest Nina in the face of the Lord of War, the eight gods of the Luna, the Lord of the Underworld, the Sun God, and the super-horror hostile of their strongest priests In the camp, An Hughes did not think that the Elshens he believed in had the ability to confront, even if he was replaced by the "Flame and Destruction God" before the defeat of the war master, Afando could not do it, and even the Lord of War had fallen. Danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, Francis, although he said "the sky is falling," describes the Anxis heart, feels that the future is very bright, but it falls to the actual situation, it falls to the real In the danger, he is still more willing to believe in his own judgment, rather than blindly waiting for the great existence beyond all definitions and imaginations to give the power of El God. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ance after hearing the disagreement between Lucien and Francis, El is still as deep as the Erdo Sea, not surprised at all, slowly and firmly said: "Speak out of you Reasons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quietly licked his teeth, whether or not El is "heavier", at least He is more like a god than before. The momentum is even stronger. After all, the state of the mountain collapses in front of you and the face is not changed. It is obviously more convincing than the violent and astounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Francis, seeing him laughing and shutting up, not talking, Lucien understands that he is waiting for his own mouth to judge himself about the situation Grasp the ability and look for anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very cautious, and now I’ve not relaxed my guard and vigilance. Lucien’s heart is dark, and he’s discouraged: “Because this is an opportunity. , a good opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Opportunity? Complete death, the opportunity to enter the underworld?" An Hughes thought that the number and strength had surged more than eight times. The enemy, his head hurts, his daring disappears, and secretly blames Lucian and Francis for exposing the theological debate, revealing the true identity of the great El God, attracting the warlord’s guards and taboos - he suspects that El is The plan was smooth, and the true identity was revealed to Francis and Leviathan. Therefore, there was some ambiguity in the blame. I believed in it and dedicated to the god of fire and destruction for more than 20 years. The kid of the secret prayer meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression solemnly said: “Why is the High Priest of the War Lord commanding the Luna and the Underworld to dominate this evening? Why does she have to drive the other six teachers? The deities of the gods and the priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El’s unpredictable nod, as if he had fully understood the words that Lucien wanted to say, his eyes turned, looking Francis, signaling him to add to An Hughes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because He is feared by the Lord of War, He is afraid of the greatness of El God, fearing that he will fall and die under the glory of your infinite gods, so Before he can figure out your strength level, He does not dare to do it easily. His priests are not daring to rush. If you have completely awakened and recovered to the highest surname, such an attack will lead to the fall of tragedy. "Hazardous action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis said a lot of compliments, but the actual meaning is very simple, that is, he and Lucien blow a breakthrough The sky, scared the Lord of war, and some scruples of the god of "resurrection, abundance and redemption", such as Yue, so command and drive the other eight gods and their priests to start, when the time is abnormal, you can shirk to the gods They compete for religious resources and private conflicts in the river valley missionary qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time in the theological debate, Francis and Lucien deliberately represented the "Resurrection, Fertility, and Redemption God" as a kind-hearted god. For this kind of god, He will not pursue it as long as the reason is right, and Francis and Lucien judge from the data of the Lord of War and other gods, that he or all the gods of the Angloma and Babul. The subconscious does not believe in the existence of omnipotence and omnipotence, because the gods that are murdered or deceived are everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out to be like this..." An Hughes thought carefully, Nina didn't do it on the spot, and didn't directly attack it. It really has a taste of this. El Wei nodded and nodded, a smile on his lips, but forcibly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we still have eight gods and their high priests." An Hughes is still worried. "This is also not our current strength." Confrontation, we are better to withdraw in time, the great El God has awakened the self, and will only become stronger as time goes by, when it is possible to crush them by strength, we do not need to take advantage of the momentary benefits Such a big risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See An Hughes to speak, Lucien preached: "Anxis, you first think about it, except for the moon god Asin and the underworld do not mention, only one of the other six sects can get our legacy of the river valley missionary qualifications, This ratio is quite low. You said that they will have other thoughts, such as accidentally killing Luna during the siege, such as setting a trap and getting the most credit, as well as really working with us to kill other gods. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be." An Hughes has no doubts about authenticity, and El has maintained a state of peace and tranquility. "This is indeed our chance. However, Leviathan, Francis, how do you tell which sect is sincere cooperation, which sect is ready to betray the profit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis laughed: "Why Want to tell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? El couldn’t help but make a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their position is too complicated, and it will change as the situation changes. The current intelligence and information must accurately determine who the ally is. When this is related to the problem of self-destruction, the predecessor's reputation and cooperation record of each god are not trustworthy." Francis made a completely negative answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxis looked at Francis inexplicably, what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the message: "Since their own position is swaying, maybe the last idea is cooperation, the next idea becomes a betrayal, very difficult to judge Then why do we try to distinguish who is an ally? We should change our minds and stop trying to distinguish them. Instead, we use our actions to make their positions firm and make them allies!"<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> Strong, showing self-confidence, showing the attitude of not being afraid of the Lord of War, then they are choosing the possibility of six competitions, or will we cooperate with us to expel the priests of the war masters, and share the valley together?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These ventilating letters, except for possible traps, do not imply their expectations. As long as we perform well enough, the traps will become flat. Even boarding the sky Ladder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis added: "Of course, they are more likely to struggle and hesitate to wait and see, and the situation will not be shot, but we Isn't this a short-lived opportunity? The chance to leave after the death of Ashin, the god of the moon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do in the future? We will find that we are using them and will also anger the Lord of war.” An Hughes is also a person who has been preaching and experienced, and probably understands the meaning of Lucien and Francis, but still has some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis smiled: "What is the purpose of our trip to the Solna Valley?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kill the moon god Asin and deprive him of his surname." An Hughes answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would we not be chased by the Lord of War? He also destroys the surname of God and is determined to win the great Afando." Asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxis gently decapitated: "If it wasn’t for me to master the method of changing my face, I was already killed by the priest of the war."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have we had the help of these six sects?" Francis and Lucien turned inquiring, the goal was not Anthus, but "inscrutable" El . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they will help the Lord of War to deal with us." An Hughes was a bit gnashing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most important thing at the moment is to restore the strength of the El God. Without strength, the allies will become traitors, not to mention the gods that have been betrayed. Lu Xien began to summarize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the purpose is achieved, the consequences will not be more serious, then why not?" Francis also asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anxis was silent for a moment and shook his head: "I have no doubts." The great El God merged with the god's surname of the Luna, and initially recovered powerfully. With strength, they can turn them into allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
