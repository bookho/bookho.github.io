			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warm sun at noon, a low-key luxury carriage is moving slowly towards the "Button" castle at the core of the southwestern aristocratic area of ​​the Ural City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, the pedestrians who saw it, whether they are nobles or citizens, have let them go, respectfully let it pass first, because it belongs to the Urals The carriage of the Countess Viter, the city's lord, is not the usual three-carriage of the cargo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, Lucien pretends to admire the streetside exotic look at the map of the Shahran Empire that was specially collected in the Soul Library and is concentrated in the Urals. Near the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl’s invitation came suddenly. Lucien couldn’t find a reason why the normal aristocrats could refuse, so he had to promise to go. This made Lucien feel very emotional inside. When playing a nobleman, he was also bound by this identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This invitation should be beyond the expectations of Carlylena and Ivanovsky, which may destroy their original arrangements and let They are caught off guard, making big mistakes, and they can bring about drastic and dangerous changes. I must prepare early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is quite sure The invitation is by no means a plan for Calilina and Ivanovsky, because before they control themselves or other members of the Vladimir family who have no background, they will certainly not risk themselves to appear in front of Count Witt. If Earl Witt suddenly saw himself and appointed other Witt family girls, their greed and longing would be like a basket of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This judgment is one of the reasons why Lucien accepts the invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can Clarina and Ivanovsky not strictly control what Mr. Witt sees and hears? How come they expected The invitation outside?" Lucien thought with a puzzled thought that since he was deliberately trying to conquer the legacy of Count Wit, and the Count of Wit was in serious ill, he was favored by Ivanovsky and Carlyle. The extent of it should not be difficult to get rid of the big knights and knights of his subordinates, so that he can only know what they want him to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not possible, Lucien can only persuade Ivanovsky to go home and buy the manor, land and mine as landowners, not If you want to smuggle a dangerous career, don't think about taking the inheritance of an earl, and you can't play with its IQ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at the map, Lucien asked the next Leo about the scenery around the Ural city, especially if there was any gloomy, often Haunted place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a worst plan for things to start with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, there are churches, often haunted places only in the story of scaring children, or by evil wizards who live in the mountains. However, as far as I know, there are several ore in the west of the Ural City because of the frequent landslides and numerous deaths. They are called 'the place of the demon curse' and 'connected to the cave of hell' and stop mining.” Invite the Earl of Lucien After listening to the conversation between Lucien and Leo, Nikita, the representative of the host, gave a detailed introduction to the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a strong knight of the official knight level, with the title of the Lord, but when he fought against the heretics in the South, he was the subordinate of the Count of Witt, and he was He has been saved many times, so he willingly does not enjoy the prominent status and status, and serves as the servant of the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, whether in the big nobility or the Dagong, the king, the emperor, there are similar characters, they and the Knights obey the obligation, join the Knights to take turns to protect the lords of the nobility The knights are different, for a variety of reasons, they have given up the right to protect the lords as a landlocked aristocrat: #br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the right to transfer their rights to their children. Serve as a escort to consolidate rights or obtain a family title that exceeds its own level; some are because of the help of life; some are the lord's promise when they receive the secret cultivation of the lord and the provision of materials, and promise to be the guards for several years after they become a certain level; Some are simply precious and unique ways to temper and improve the blood of the lord family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Nikita, Lucien smiled: "Mr. Nikita, in fact, is very gloomy in the northwestern province, often haunted, the deceased can not Peaceful place, although the church has tightly controlled it, I still know a little." This is an indirect proof of the identity of the Vladimir family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucian didn't mind, and continued to ask Nikita and Leo to improve his understanding of the detailed terrain and environment nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After half an hour, the magnificent castle that covered the vines and tasted with sorrow appeared in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, rushing from a different direction to a beautiful and gorgeous carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just stood firm and saw the carriage horse standing in front of his legs, a beautiful woman in a beautiful woolen dress in the maid’s Yan Fuzhong appeared quite anxiously to go down. Her white snow set her own beautiful and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Peter..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Carlylena..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien and Carlylena did not expect to meet outside the castle gate, and they were very surprised to say hello to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Carlylena’s appearance, recalling her previous actions, Lucien smiled: “Mrs. Carlylena, are you visiting Count Wetter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I heard that Uncle Witt invited a guest, worried that he would not follow the embarrassment of a good doctor, so he came to remind him not to be too tired. Take a good rest.” After Carlylena was surprised, the smile became charming and splendid, as she did at the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gentleman likes to reach out: "Mrs. Carlylena, I will follow your reminder, will not delay the rest of the Earl, please." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, your courtesy is the best of the Shahran nobles I have ever seen, I like it very much." After Carlylena praised it, The maid swayed in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is telling the truth, most of the nobles in the Shahran Empire are only obeying the most important ceremonies, preferring fighting and spirits, so often It was called a simple and rude "barbarian" by the nobles of the countries to which the Southern Church belongs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an invitation to their surprise, what happened in the castle? Lucien calmly followed Carlylena into the "Button" castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In a small living room in the old castle, the fireplace burns with a blazing flame, creating a warmth like a spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took off the coat of ordinary coat that was specially worn outside, and handed it to the waiter to hang on the coat rack, and he gave the official etiquette to the noble The old man salute: "I am honored to meet you, Count Earl Witt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is sitting on the sofa in the living room by the fireplace, wearing a thick black coat As if I was very afraid of being wrapped tight in the cold. His face was gray and defeated, but he could barely see the harsh and hard face lines in the past. The light blue eyes were as yellow and muddy as other old people, and he wore a black soft hat on his head. Hair that seems to be getting scarce. The whole person is like a plant that lacks water and is dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a seven-level knight who was brave and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the appearance of Earl Witt, Lucien feels the horror of time passing from the heart, and the fear of aging death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, magic has many ways to extend life." This fear made Lucien a strong desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear of death, yearning for immortality and eternal life is the tireless pursuit of human beings, the short-lived wisdom of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Witt squirmed as if it had a layer of gray lips, and the voice was weak and old: "Peter, I am also very happy to see you. In the southwest of the empire I rarely see such a young and outstanding member of the Vladimir family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After saying a word, he took a few breaths: "This is My niece Carlyle, you should know. This is my steward, Xie Miao, who has followed me for many years and is a good steward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlylena sat on the left side of the Count of Witt to serve him, while the gray-haired Xie Miao stood on the right side of the Count of Witt. His blue eyes looked at Lucien, nodding his face with a faint smile, and his face was not wrinkled. But every one is very deep, making it difficult to judge his age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
