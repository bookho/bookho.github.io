			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense blue-gray 疙瘩 quickly covered his face; the white eye was white, and it protruded beyond the limit of normal people; the nose rotted, and the pieces of gray meat went to Drop it down, revealing the deep black holes and the white bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was strongly influenced by his own familiar face that shaves and washes his face every day with such a terrible change with a strange smile. The visual impact, I can be so ugly, so embarrassing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bitter cold seems to rise from the caudal vertebrae, spreading quickly to the body of the Sean, although the mechanized mind has no fear, confusion, but high above The soul has not panicked for a moment, wanting to release the magic, but the body and the soul are as numb as there is no way to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the road in the mirror, Lucien, squeezed a clown-like smile with a rotten, gray-faced face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang, as soon as I saw this smile, Lucien felt inexplicable and the heart suddenly stopped. After three seconds, it violently jumped again and again, oh, oh, the sound was as loud as it was in Lucien's ear, and the action seemed to jump out of the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is rushing out of the heart, and the blood vessels are inflated. Lucien just recovered from that paralysis and felt that the blood went straight to the brain, and everything seen in the eyes Things have turned into blood red, blurred, and very beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood vessels in the hand are raised, and the blood that is rising and falling out can be seen flowing wildly. This makes Lucien’s body weak and seems to have passed a lot of vitality. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this critical moment, Lucifer, who has high will, strong control, and emotional fluctuations due to mechanized mental effects, calmly removes subconsciousness Going to the side and rolling over to avoid the plan, the body lit up a faint glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This radiance is sacred and pure, and it seems to contain one rune, which keeps appearing, flowing and disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Lucien, who had begun to rot in the mirror, stepped forward and even wore it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red tongue in its mouth suddenly became longer, the color turned black, and it was virtually imaginary, hitting Lucien’s body like a javelin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-ring magic "Strong Flame Shield" has no defense against this faint black tongue, and it is used in the past to make it wear the past, a strong breath of death. Gathered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is a layer of protection around Lucien, the sacred radiance and runes are indestructible to block the blunt black tongue, and the tip of the tongue is awkward Burning the sound, a black smoke rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four-level magic "anti-death enchantment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien was promoted to the middle class, he cracked the second layer of the seal of "曰之冕", and he was able to perform three more spells per day: Searing glow (level 3), anti-death enchantment (level 4), flamethrowing (level 5), in which anti-death enchantment can resist the killing effect related to death power, and is extremely strong against death, nightmare and other injuries. Protection ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Charlotte and Sandra also discovered the strangeness here: Lucian looked at the mirror in a daze, and there was a magic on his body. The breath caused by the object, and the mirror distortion is blurred, nothing can be seen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra pointed the purple magic wand against the mirror, which suddenly burst into violent brilliance like the sun, and it was more dazzling than the direct sunlight within 20 meters. 20 meters away, it seems that all the light is absorbed as black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light and dark four-ring magic "scrub", only for undead or devil, demons and other evil alien space creatures, but no magic A sacred and solemn feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pure light, the twisted mirrors glow a little bit of black, they rise and atomize, and finally float up and condense into a horrible monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hood is half-open and does not cover its appearance. It has red eyes and a cheeky face but a layer of [***] rotten meat. Living, two rows of white teeth are exposed directly because there is no lip. When you pay attention to its appearance, you will find that it is ambiguous and changes rapidly in different sputum appearances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster was surrounded by countless blacks, and the light of the smashing smashed out of it, and then it laughed loudly, causing a gray-fading shadow around Sandra and Charlotte. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Spell Absorbing Wall" that runs through the rune outside the Charlotte Magic Gown is highlighted. After the gray shadows are swept up, they are quickly merged and decomposed. Absorbed by it, but as the shadows get more and more, the spell absorption wall also has a faint gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Charlotte fluttered straight out, as if the bookshelf was free to fall on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Rings Force Magic "Virtual Gravity"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five colored energy balls around Sandra and Susan's head are spinning fast, and each gray shadow is swept up by this energy ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing gray shadows absorbed, the energy method ball swells up, so Sandra's magic wand is pointed, a red-yellow-grey-based The colored ball is played against the sly monster wearing a gorgeous robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two consecutive "Palmera's Energy Balls" hit the black air around the monsters, and they were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance of the smoldering smashed into the air, letting the monster make a painful scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Charlotte did not attack, but the right hand with white gloves was lifted, and an illusory giant palm appeared around the monster, holding it Live, making it difficult to get rid of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-ring force field magic "Douglas's huge palm" is said to be a series of palm shape force magic that improved a legendary magician of ancient times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "element" ring on the index finger of the right hand is constantly accelerating the recovery of vitality to Lucien, blocking the ability to move after an attack. However, Lucien did not escape, still standing in the same place, the left hand took a crystal clear crystal ball from the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball suddenly darkens, like a dark night sky, and then a star shines, giving a pure glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball then flew up on its own, floating 20 cm above Lucian’s head, and a little starlight around it condensed into a ball of twelve It corresponds to the stars in the crystal ball, and it revolves around it to construct a small star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster similar to the nightmare class, the ordinary magic attack is invalid, so Lucien did not waste time trying the power of the big fireball, the poisonous fog, etc. It is the direct casting of the unique magic "Maskillin Star". This is a collection of illusions that interfere with the enemy's "destiny", absorb supernatural forces and fly out of the "planet" attack. In the book "Astrology and Elements", there is a corresponding nine-ring magic "Muskey". The star map of Lin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the construction of the "Maskillin Star" on the top of the head, a starlight is shot from the surrounding light group, illuminating the monster, wanting to identify Is it a phantom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the starlight, this monster has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Charlotte once again pointed his black magic wand, and the silent monster seemed to be a little dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Rings Change Magic "Impresses Spell Resistance"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic has just produced an effect, Sandra and Lucien are on the offensive in tandem, the timing is extremely accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large net of sun rays covers the monster, holding it tightly, and every black mark emits black gas, but Engulfed by the burning rays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A "planet" flying over the head of Lucien has turned into a meteor, and this magic also succumbs to undead or alien space evil creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no sound in the burst of light, the monster is fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Susan, who was scared to death, quietly sighed, every body of the monster was twisted, then the ground began to distort and the wall began to distort, "曰The smoldering of the 20-meter light began to distort, and even the hand of Charlotte, who controlled him, began to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
