			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold...hey...la?" Arthur had never heard of this term, only to be difficult to repeat according to Lucien’s pronunciation, but when After he read it, he had an inexplicable feeling. He felt that the word was as strange as other magic spells, hiding the mysterious and unknown terrorist power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left his cheeks on his left hand to prevent himself from laughing out, and then a serious and authentic: "Because of the nature of the land itself, these alchemy materials sometimes need Mixed use sometimes must be used separately, when they are all mixed, it is called gold 坷 ,, and the rest are called Jin 坷 1 1, No. 2, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur saw Lu's attitude "serious", so he was full of merchant-like smiles: "This is a very good name, Mr. Evans, you really have a talent for name, it is called gold...坷...la." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I am a nameless person, Lucien licked himself, the same as Mr. Victor and Mr. Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the name of the alchemy substance, Arthur also sought the consent of Lucien to name the new company "Holm Minerals and Harvest Company" ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the witness of the Elder Management Department Eric, Arthur and Lucien signed the documents, and they also represented the Magic Council. This agreement was reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, cheers, celebrates us as partners." Arthur picked up the glass with "sky blue" and collided with the wine glass in Lucien's hand. It makes a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s lips smiled slightly without opening, and then “Daily Blue” was drunk: “Mr. Doyle, I hope we can cooperate happily. You When promoting these alchemical materials, we must make clear the range of dosages determined by our experiments. Otherwise, it will not only increase the production of grain, but also have negative effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we always respect the opinions of the Arcanists." Arthur asked his blonde secretary to hand out a stack of thick documents to Lucien. "Mr. Evans, this is our large-scale refinement." Plan, you have a look at the magic array and there is no need to modify it. You are the authority in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He complimented a little, although it is not clear Lucien's arcane level is exactly what he is, but with the identity of the Holm Crown Award winner and the fourth-level arcane master, it is definitely an authority in the field of elements and alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took over and turned over and confirmed that this is the last paper in the "Alchemy", which will be arranged by means of energy conversion. The cost of a constant alchemy array and the maintenance of late energy are minimized. According to the paper, a magic tower is built on a large river with abundant water, and the energy contained in them is converted into electric energy through a magnetic field, and then the electric energy is sent to the alchemy workshop to provide energy for those magic arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is a magic version of the hydropower station..." Lucien quietly evaluated, but if it is arranged according to the normal constant magic array, at least cost Hundreds of times the cost, because the energy they need to be extracted from special magic gems, and these magic materials can be recovered through the magic array to absorb the sun, moonlight, shadows and other power, value is high. If it is not a constant magic array, you need to change the material regularly, which is also a star phase number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned the paper to Arthur, gently laughing: "This is the best solution, and the extra power may have other uses." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask the alchemist, if Mr. Evans has other inspirations, you can still provide us, we still cooperate according to the current agreement." He handed the paper to his own glamorous secretary. "The construction of these magic arrays and installations in the first year may not be profitable, but Mr. Evans is assured that there should be an annuity from the stock in the second year, and will not delay you. Advance to the mid-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Arthur? Doyle, Lucien turned and bid farewell to Eric, and unexpectedly found that Cindy and Donna both looked at themselves with their hands and eyes brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, Mr. Evans, it’s good to have knowledge and talent." Cindy’s expression is complicated and sighs, from reverence, envy, yearning, Admired, then she shook her right hand into a small fist. "I must become a formal magician. Even if you are not as good as Mr. Evans, you must use your knowledge and strength to get the respect of others and get the wealth you deserve." !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donna said with a smile: "Hey, Mr. Evans, you are the best example of our magic apprentices. Your story tells us that within the Magic Council, as long as you have the talent and ability, you will definitely shine your own glory. Get the status you deserve. Right, is your Arcane Cram school still receiving students? Can I follow you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She uses magic school The teacher’s unique “inspirational tone” was a joke, but when I called “Mr. Evans” and “you”, there was a feeling of sourness, although mainly because Eric was there, she and Cindy did not have the same level as usual. She is familiar with "Evans", but whenever she sees the fourth-level Arcanist and the Second Ring Magician badge on Lucien's chest, she feels awe and unreasonable for no reason, but she does not look close, he goes too far. So fast, so that friends can only see his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have time, you can come and listen on Saturday." Lucien wiped the cold sweat, this arcane to make up the class, the bigger the bigger Become a magical organization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric looked at Lucien and wanted to say something, but in the end he just comforted: "Evans, have you met Mr. Felipe? Don't care too much about his attitude, he has always been like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric in the office heard the first sentence of Felipe and Lucien greeting words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy and Donna slammed quietly because it involved one thing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his own experiment of overthrowing human life mechanics, Felipe once again won the Immortal Throne Award and shared the Holm Crown Award with the unsigned elemental will, becoming the twenty-seventh winner, and his reputation reached a peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pale hand believes that the experiment of synthetic urea is not important enough, and the "miracle experiment" that simulates the natural primitive environment to generate the source of life has no specific object, so The "Imperial Throne Award" was not awarded to the high level of Lucien or the elemental will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a thing in front, the two girls and Eric certainly thought that Lucien was not willing to meet Felipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe’s immortal throne award this time was the talisman of the last time, so he became the magic robe according to his request, the name is “life” – The previous talisman was the "restorator", and the Holm crown ring was called "sago acid", derived from the name of the fatty acid it synthesizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Felipe to get two seven-level perfect magic items, Lucien is very envious, but because of lack of strength, can only be patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"Sariwa" town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer Roy walked out of his own field with his farm tools, and he couldn’t control his emotions to stop again when he passed the piece of land that he could see every day. Wait and see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How full of wheat, what a brilliant harvest color! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the oats in my place can do this too!" Roy was dry in the sun, as if the wrinkles were cracking slightly, the eyes were I watched it motionlessly, and my heart was full of yearnings. "With such a harvest, even if you pay various taxes, you can let your children fill their stomachs. They don't have to sleep in the middle of the night, and they fall on the ground and look for falling. Bread crumbs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is the case for several years, you can make a fortune, and wait for William to send him to the Cavaliers training when he is eight years old. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a father, Roy just thought about the children, did not consider his life, but soon his expression became frustrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a group of beautiful men and women with long ears came from the other side. When they walked to Roy's face, they were asked by a handsome and delicate girl. "Hello, why are you not too happy to see the harvest scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is much more beautiful than the Queen’s family, Miss Oona, and noble and elegant, like an angel told by the priests, Roy feels like a bright, screaming: "Several adults, I am not Unhappy, just thinking that the magical things that make oats harvest can only be used by noble lords, I, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uneducated Roy I don't know how to explain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
