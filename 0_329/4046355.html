			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the joke, the storm dominated the solemnity: "I and Hathaway have achieved initial results in removing the element 'impurities' and found that several elements have surnames. Very identical twins, triplets, and even quadruplets, the biggest difference is in atomic weight, so the measurement of atomic mass data is inaccurate. After excluding these interferences, they predict the atomic quantity data and the position in the periodic table. It is completely consistent, which makes me and Hathaway no doubt about the law of the elemental cycle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time suddenly said what the isotope is doing? Lucian smiled a little puzzledly: "Is it that my last proposal produced results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Lucien proposed "energy one copy" The hypothesis, "solved" the problem of thermal radiation experiments, and with the establishment of his atomic research institute, the affairs became "busy", Fernando has changed the form of teaching, and no longer use the method of reading the letter, but Give him some requirements every week, such as reading mathematics and books in different arcane fields, such as parsing a five-ring magic, and then giving detailed instructions during the inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fernando’s own research projects and discussions with the Arcanists can only wait until the monthly regular meeting, so Lucien knows today. The two great arcans have made breakthroughs in the separation of isotopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, almost let us go the wrong way." Fernando did not say good-naturedly, "These elements are very similar, and the 'elements' of atomic weight differences are not too big. Hathaway proposes to temporarily put them and similar elements in the same periodic table position, called the equivalent element. This allows us to completely abandon the indivisible theory of atoms, if the atom does not have a certain internal structure, why Such a strange phenomenon of the same element?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The paper we have collaborated on recently completed, ready to be published in the next issue of "Arcane", so that most of the Olympics The surgeon is psychologically prepared, and at the same time, he is trying to improve the magic to study the mysteries inside the atom. It is very difficult to try. But I didn't expect your kid to casually find a new particle that is much smaller than the atom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although there is no definitive evidence that it belongs to the internal structure of the atom, the difference in magnitude is enough to convince everyone that it is not an atom, but a tiny particle. Powerfully Breaking the atom is the theory of the basic composition of matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando still has no "praise" for Lucian's experimental results, the evaluation is casually fooled, but his The expression is very serious: "This will have a lot of impact on many arcane masters, especially the arcane divisions whose elements are basic. Therefore, Lucien's this paper should not be submitted first and temporarily sealed." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and Hathaway will screen out some high-level arcans who can accept this, let them observe your experiment and confirm your thesis, Then, after they go down, they will discuss with the surrounding arcane masters, point out the contradiction between the periodicity of elements and atomism, gradually transform their thoughts, soften their positions, and minimize the loss of things."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper has been confirmed by rigorous experiments. It is not only a hypothesis, it must be treated more cautiously, and it cannot be submitted directly for review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion." Lucien said that he recognized the teacher's handling. Anyway, there is a storm dominated, no one can take the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the way to Sean leaving his study, the storm dominated the temper and walked back and forth, thinking about the candidate: "You have to choose your own cognitive world for atomic theory." A high-ranking orthopaedic master, and a relatively open-minded, high-level elements that have doubts about atomic theory through the periodicity of the elemental cycle... can't be revealed to the pale hands and the silver-moon song ally, hey, they know. Will you let go of this opportunity to fight the will of the element?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the six organizations of the Magic Council, the elemental will, the pale hand, the Palmer’s cabin is the most powerful Strong, standing behind a big arcane master, a legendary magician, the elemental will is "element dominator" Hathaway, "creator" Davy, the pale hand is "the soul of the dead" Vicente and " Half-god Lich" Congos, Palmera's hut is "ice witch" Helen? Paris and "The Lord of the Air" Hercully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Moon Song League is behind the legendary magician "Silver Moon Scholar" Chelsea? Holt, but with the "master of control" Brooke has a very close relationship, the House of the Wizard is the two legendary magicians "curse of the eye" and "deformation master", the tower is a "prophet" biased toward the direction of research, The relationship with the parliament is the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a long time, Fernando's temper began to become violent: "This kid's ability to get into trouble is faster than his arcane and magical ability, and I have to help make up later! Not at all!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that have been encountered in the past few decades have been made in a month-to-month situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar, Rock, Sprint, etc. want to play the spirit of "the institute is my home, eat and sleep all in it", inexplicably Put a day off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes them scratch their hearts, and they still have a lot of experiments, don’t want to rest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the time when Jerome took the time to get his wife out of the rendezvous and make up for the neglect of going back home the night before, envying both Lazar and Rock. The bachelor's eyes are green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Atom Research Institute" is unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Douglas, the "Elemental Dominator" Hathaway, his teacher Fernando, and the "Death of the Hand" that Lucien first met. "Oliver, he is very handsome, and his temperament is excellent. Even if he looks like forty years old, he does not lose the slightest charm, but adds a mature charm." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the uninvited master of control, the ruler of the dead, and Helen who had just left for two days, all the great arcans were all together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien also saw several legendary magicians, who always smirked, wearing a blond little girl magical couple, that is, The inventor of the magic steam train also had a sullen face, and the "cursed eye" Atlante, whose eyes had been closed, reached a total of four legendary magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level arcane masters have reached more than forty, and there are elements such as Morris, Lavendi, Gaston, and Rocklinne. In the sorcerer who suspects atomism, there are other high-level magicians and masters of non-elemental systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were filled with small conference rooms at the Atomic Research Institute, and they couldn’t help but think of it: If there was a sudden accident, all the meeting rooms would be The magicians are all killed, and the magic council is almost the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien? Evans, is your experiment to confirm the discontinuity of energy?" When Lucien opened the conference room and laboratory The mirrored passage, when preparing to enter the lab demonstration, asked a tall and thin old man with a hostile hostility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just heard from the teacher that he is the Archmage Roland, the main supporter of the energy essence theory, the Silver Moon Medal and the winner of the Ice and Snow Medal, Member of the Arcane Review Committee, specializing in electromagnetic, light and dark, thermal and force field magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some high-level arcane masters who don’t know the situation are looking up at Lucien, which is their question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they don’t think it’s proven that the energy is not continuous, so an impactful experiment will have the effect of destroying the surname, and the Arcanists will definitely not agree with Lucy. Demonstration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery of a new particle." Lucien said concisely, not arguing with Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a particle inside the atom?" was previously hinted by Hathaway and Fernando, and Gaston, who was psychologically prepared, was a little excited and a little afraid to guess. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is subject to experimentation." Raven looked at Lunesse and walked into the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris is squinting: "I have a hunch with or without atomic internal particles, I will be very sad."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment is not difficult. After dealing with the vacuum problem, it is the adjustment of the electric field and the magnetic field. The arcane masters who obtained the data through the mirror magic array combined the previously measured inaccurate charge amount. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Lavin was slightly excited to say: "The quality is only about one-thousandth of a hydrogen atom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the heavy elements after the periodic table, the atomic weight is at most several dozen times that of the hydrogen atom, it is possible to preliminarily judge that the particle is not an atom but is even smaller. Particles, unless there are one or two more vacancies in front of the periodic table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
