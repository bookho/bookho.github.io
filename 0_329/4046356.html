			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver looked at Lucien along the eyes of the Arcanists and pushed the gold-rimmed glasses that were purely for the sake of increasing literary temperament: "Your What does it mean to make Evans an audit committee, to identify the results of subversion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He likes to think about problems from the perspective of subversion." Minutes, Hathaway speaks in a low-key manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris’s face is not very good to add: “The results of several recent subversions have either been proposed by Lucien or triggered by him, and he is clearly visible. Not only has a deep grasp of the current arcane system, but also can extract knowledge from it and use it to improve magic and enhance the level of magic. It is not bound by the accepted theory, and dare to propose a subversion of the surname, plus he has not yet promoted the ranks, understanding The world has not yet been initially substantive and interacts with the soul, so it is the best person to review similar papers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bastard kid, a tiny particle that does not belong to the atom, opens The door to the micro world, do I dare not issue the Holm Crown Award? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to do so, you must raise the standard of the Holm Crown Award! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When is the standard that "has a breakthrough in the elemental magic field and can leave a footprint in the history of elemental magic" becomes so rampant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the treasury of the elemental will is part of the Arcane Master, the legendary magician, the Archmage, and the high-level magicians to explore the alien space and the mysterious regional harvest. Although they are not what they don't need, they are higher than the kingdom in terms of value. Together with the income of the alchemy industry and the usual tasks, they can maintain the Holm Crown Award for one year without bankruptcy. Two or three times a year in a row! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the explanation of Morris’s official statement, other high-ranking arcans nodded silently, apparently the task could not be undertaken by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t look at the fact that others can accept the atom is not the most basic substance without any hindrance, it is entirely because atomism is not at all a cognitive world. The component has either begun to be skeptical. If the papers that contradict the theoretical conflicts that they insist on and whether there is any arguable evidence will be reviewed, the end may not be very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be said that most of them have not raised the concept of subversion, belonging to the development, breakthrough and improvement of the current arcane theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a young arcane master who can continuously propose a subversive view and is unaffected is a good candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road was stared at by everyone's "appreciation" and he felt that he was "self-sufficient." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The very suitable candidate, the only problem is the identity, rank and prestige of Evans." Oliver spread his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also made a comment: "He is only a five-level arcane master, five-ring magician, whether there is enough arcane and magic knowledge to review high-level papers Can he assess whether the results of the paper can be trusted by the author of the paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides the knowledge of mathematics, he still has some problems, elements, heat, electromagnetic, light and dark, force In terms of field, alchemy and astrology, his arcane level is no worse than other high-level arcans, but the arcane level has not been upgraded due to lack of time accumulation. In other magic fields, he also has enough standards to identify whether to subvert. The surname is then handed over to the appropriate Arcane division for review.” Fernando, as the teacher of Lucien, solemnly replied to Roland’s questioning, although there is no direct praise for the words, but it is clear from the description of the comparative surname that he is right. Sean's satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcane level is a major criterion for judging the level of arcane, but not the only standard, especially when encountering arcane divisions that are not routinely developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem with the level of the Arcane level." Heather Wei suddenly popped up, his expression was still cold and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth level belongs to the category of high-level arcane masters, in line with the identity of the Holm crown award winner, does not line the magic level of Sean, has already entered The qualification of the Arcane Review Board is just like Isabella is about to become an auditor for illusion and astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is dissatisfied with Lucien, and he "betrays" the position of the essence of energy, so he once again questioned: "Herther Hathaway, the road Sean Evans, this paper, because it has not been confirmed that the new particles belong to the internal structure of the atom, only four hundred to six hundred arcane integrals can be obtained according to the standard, and his reference to the black body radiation formula, the reference of the cathode ray paper, is short. In the short two months, there will never be more than one hundred arcane points, plus the previous part is more than two thousand, and it is still far away from the sixth level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;"Roland, have you forgotten the recent discussion?" Raven snarled at Roland. "The influence factor of the "Arcane" journal has been set at 3 and will be officially implemented next month!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien currently has four papers published in "Arcane", in which brainwaves, formulas and cathode ray papers will certainly be quoted in large numbers, after the next month, this part The income will be tripled. Two hundred or so arcane points in January are by no means a dream, and most of the arcade masters have time periods to write their own papers, and they also have their own research directions. The reference to Lucian's thesis is far from enough. Arrived at the high point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raven, don't forget, before it created a strong discussion atmosphere, the citation will be so much, can such a craze last for a long time? Even if I can, Lucien Evans wants to get enough points to advance to Level 6 and it takes four to five months. We can't make him an audit committee in advance, which will make most Arcanists unconvinced!" Roland shows His own opposition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also understands formulas, especially the formulas that can be used to improve magic. There will be a lot of references, and new rays will certainly become a hot topic of discussion and research, so It was only after the discussion of the qualification of the audit committee was postponed to four or five months. After a long period of time without the calm of subverting the surname, the archaeologists may not insist on this matter and let it disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland said it makes sense. Postponing four or five months has little effect, at least on the surface, it cannot destroy the authority of the audit committee. Arcanists can be selected." Many audit committees agreed with Roland's comments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravendi also eased his emotions and nodded gently. In his opinion, it was only postponed for four or five months, and did not affect Lucien’s entry into the Arcane Review. The outcome of the committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, he can have six levels." Hathaway once again speaks without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her definite attitude made Fernando a bit confused, and there must be a short period of reference to the points. Where is Lucien going now to get the rest* * Hundreds of Arcane points? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris "understood" the meaning of Hathaway, turning his eyes to Lucien and seeking his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also understood the "suggestions" of Lord Hathaway, so he nodded solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris turned his head and smiled like a cry: "The proponent and designer of the miracle experiment is Lucien."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery is on, it is a Holm crown ring, and may also be accompanied by the immortal throne! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small meeting room suddenly became awkward, and many of the Arcane Review Committees looked at him like a newcomer to Lucien, full of incredible colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he?" Roland couldn't believe that the miracle experiment that he highly admired was actually proposed and designed by Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural source of life through the simulation of the original environment is a very big impact on every arcist, even if it does not adhere to the theory of human life mechanics, It will be shocked by this experiment of mystery of life - no one of the arcane masters does not want to explore the secrets of life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this reaction, Lucien seems to see himself on the scene of purifying and ranking crazy growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morris! How can you tell it!" Raven snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he saw Lucien nodding his head, he did not think he had enough mentality and strength to prepare for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris smiled: "The discovery of new particles will not strike the doctrine of the truth, but it has a subversive effect on the improved teaching of the pope. So there is no miracle experiment, Lucien will be attacked by the church, it is better to throw it out, and it is convenient for us to prepare. Moreover, Felipe is only five hundred times before the purification sequence. Strength, I don't think Lu Xien is worse than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heather Wei has been secret for a long time, and today I know that you are the designer of the miracle experiment. Lucien, I personally like this experiment very much, it shows us a lot of things. You are the best young person I have ever seen, I think you have enough qualifications to enter the audit committee." Douglas praised kindly and kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
