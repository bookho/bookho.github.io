			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messy, unpleasant melody came from the piano under Lucien’s hands, and was still in the road to playing simple music. The playing skills can't match the high-pitched melody that I want, so the sound of one sound is like a blacksmith in the blacksmith's shop holding a hammer and tapping on Lott, Felice and Herodo. In the heart of Germany, they have a feeling of madness, and they can't wait to tear up Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Herodotus and Lott smashed out at the same time, and some could not maintain their aristocratic demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned his head and looked at them with a "clear" look: "Lotte, Felice, Herodotus, don't you practice instruments?" Mr. Victor ordered us to practice well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Herodotus clenched his hands, and his anger made his cheeks flushed. But his body is thin, he has never won since he was a child, he has a natural fear of fighting, and he still keeps a lucidity, measuring his fighting power with Lucien. [He is half a head higher than me, about one meter seven or three. The poor are born, relying on helping people to make things for a living, the strength is definitely great, and there is a good friend who is a knight attendant. He should also follow the practice of ordinary swordsmanship. I can't beat him at all. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Forget it, beat your classmates, but will be expelled by Mr. Victor. Hirodod looked at his thin body and found a reason for himself. "I don't want to see you, and I don't want your poor people to smudge my hands. I go to another piano room to practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he turned and walked to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked innocently: "What happened to Herodotus?" Can they be mad at one, so that they can cover up their own writing. Unreasonable, jumping progress of the string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herodoed, who was about to open the door of the piano, heard Lucian’s words, slipped his hand, almost fell, and looked back at Lucien At a glance, this bastard is deliberate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again measuring the gap between the two sides, Herodotus rushed out of the piano room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sees it, picks up the quill, and writes on the white paper the string that was just played, which contains a negligible symphony of destiny. The syllables, more are the words that Lucien stalks and writes together, and anyone who has music to cultivate, can watch the melody, can not help but shake his head, only a little better than the garbage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien seriously writing the staff, Lott looked up at the ceiling of the piano room, then licked his forehead and made the final confirmation: You really want to write music?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, I am writing." Lucien’s head did not answer, "Well, I have a little inspiration. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was Lucine putting down the quill, and the ugly noise rang again in this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice stood up and muttered in a weak voice: "Lotte, I think I have to go to the back garden to be quiet, I am going crazy." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lott sighed: "I also go to other piano rooms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they left Lu Xien quietly let out a sigh of relief, locked the door of the piano room, and made a little modification to the two chords that had just been written, so that they contain more symphony of fate, and then write with them. A few pages of white paper, filled with garbage-like strings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way that Lucien just thought of, using a step-by-step process to accomplish this, let them accept the fact that they are composing the music, and then use The garbage string is concealed, progressing day by day, and such progress should be reflected in the draft of the music sheet. As evidence of the later questioning, when they subconsciously feel that they have a lot of melody in the music, they can invite Victor to listen to themselves. Playing the piano version of the fate of the symphony of many flaws, let him correct the shortcomings, perfect the music, and adapt it into a real symphony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A genius who is quick to make progress and will be covered up by the obvious talents, is always more shocking than a sudden, can be circulated The symphony of hundreds of thousands of years, and claimed to be the freak that I wrote, is easy to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not without precedent. The first performance of the Beethoven Symphony of Destiny was due to factors such as cold weather and other factors, and it was not well played. It was a cold reception by the audience until a year and a half later. The concert was held in an unprecedented warm response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the progress of today’s music, and modifying the scores, Lucien began a difficult practice, trying to play the symphony of fate, slow, seven zero Eight downs, playing a beautiful and direct music like a noise, in fact, Lu Xien even if the door of the piano room is not locked, was heard, and will not be the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, whether it was Victor, Rhein, or Lott, did not come to find Lucien, let Lucien smoothly take more than 30 minutes The symphony played three times slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sky began to darken, Lucien sorted out his own writing Get the score, with a thick stack of paper, go to the performance hall on the fifth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the performance hall, the symphony orchestra is still doing exercises, and Victor is concentrating on the command. It seems that after a short break, he temporarily gets rid of the haze and is full of heart. Into the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage, Lott, Felice and Herodotus have been waiting there, listening carefully to the music and watching the way of Victor’s command, on Lucien’s Come in, just look at it coldly, completely ignoring this arrogant, madman who can't communicate and understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not care about their performance, but instead smiled and responded, causing Feili to show a weak expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in a soft audience chair, Lucien closed his eyes and listened to the music he played while thinking about how much the string should be advanced tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beautiful music, half an hour passed quickly, and Victor and Rhein walked down together and asked their students with a smile: "The afternoon musical instrument practice How is it? What are the fingering and technical problems?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mr. Victor.” Herodotus, full of anger, complained, “Luxion actually The arrogant arrogant desire to compose music, Lord, he learned the music for a long time! His poor, noisy, ugly music is like the devil's jealousy, and drove us to other piano rooms."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled at Herodotus, and he was grateful for his complaint: [Thank you, thank you for propagating this matter, otherwise I can't open it myself. 】<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing his complaint is just a smile from Lucien, Herodotus couldn’t help but continue: "Mr. Victor, you still dismiss him. I don’t want to hear the noise every day, I don’t want to hear the noise every day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor looks puzzled at Lucien: “You are trying Write the music?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of the Rhine, slightly picking silver eyebrows, funnyly looked at the music score held by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien solemnly and solemnly nodded: "Today's events, as well as past experiences, made me suddenly inspire, so I tried to write them out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Lucine's affirmative answer, Victor's name is not directly scorned, but asks: "Lu Xien, this is what you write Can you show me the stringing rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Lucien was so obvious that he wanted to let Victor take a look. There is a musician who proves his progress and has an authoritative surname in the music field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland smiled curiously: "Can you give me a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginners who have been learning music for about two months have even claimed that they have to write music, which is always very curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien certainly did not refuse, and one witness was definitely better, so the score was divided into two and passed to Victor and Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein took a closer look, thin lips could not help but move, it seems to laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
