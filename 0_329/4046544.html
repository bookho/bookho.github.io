			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superconducting? Lucian almost blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Arranging Jerome, Katrina and Reyia to do the experiment of changing the quality of different substances under ultra-low temperature conditions, Lucien is mainly for charcoal The ability to create vacuum is not at all in mind whether they can detect superconductivity, because there was no suffocation at that time, and there was no way to get closer to absolute zero. Later, everything was too busy, and I gradually forgot this one. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jerome was promoted to the middle class, and after getting the Holm crown ring, he also applied to Lucien, focusing on the X-ray research. This experiment was arranged by Lucien to Katrina and Reyia, but this is only a useful supplement, and they focus most of their attention on the new alchemy, which is the microscopic field of elements. In the particle field, I can't think of an unexpected surprise today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcibly controlling the mood, Lucien was surprised to say: "Resistance disappears?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superconductor, what a beautiful noun, when I thought of it, Lucien thought of magnetic levitation, thought of the high-energy particle collider, thought of the hope of enhancing his own electromagnetic gun, and thought of magnetically constrained nuclear fusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you really want to complete controllable nuclear fusion, then the energy core of Allinge can be further improved, and the city of the sky will no longer have energy. Restricted, the standard magician's standard will be added one, that is, there is a city that can soar in the blue sky, oh, is it called 'Sun Well', or is it called 'Eternal Furnace', or Evans can nuclear?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that fell into Xiaoxiang was awakened by Lei Yi Li Ya’s voice: “Yes, not gradually disappearing, but when the temperature drops to somewhere In a special position, the resistance suddenly disappears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What materials did you experiment with, at what temperature?" Lucien returned and began to ask carefully. Nick, Heidi, Sprint, Jerome and others also came up. They saw the two girls a little bit better in the past few days. They wanted to inquire but couldn’t find anything. They were already full of curiosity. Lazar and Roque accepted a mandatory mission and are not currently at the institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina stabilized her mood: "Teacher, because you found suffocation, the lower limit of ultra-low temperature is reduced, so we are full of interest in this experiment. Extrusion time to do ultra-low temperature experiments of various materials. Half a month ago, when we studied various ultra-low temperature conditions of mercury, we found that when the temperature dropped to 4.2 degrees from the absolute zero point, its resistance suddenly disappeared. Under the conditions, we couldn't measure it completely. Later, we experimented with other metals, such as lead, and we also had the same harvest, but the temperature was different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Unexpectedly, the resistance will disappear!" Lei Yiya has not believed in her discovery until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened carefully and told them to open the magic array and the alchemy device, repeat the experiment, and the emotions were also rid of the previous surprises. The current materials are limited to Superconductivity in ultra-low temperature conditions, the practical surname is very insufficient, even with magic assistance, it is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Lucien wants to integrate the super-magnetic field brought about by superconductivity into his own electromagnetic gun magic to enhance its power, it is not only to A similar structural model is integrated into it, and the low-temperature part of the magical ice goddess whip must be merged into it. As a result, the magic difficulty will be soared by geometric progression. Lucien initially judges that this is a legendary magic difficulty. Similarly, the magnetically constrained nuclear fusion is at least as high as that of Silver Moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the relevant materials in the Soul Library have not yet been unlocked, and there is still a long way to go in superconducting research - after the realization of the cognitive world, Lucy The related material of the special relativity in the soul library can already be seen. The general theory of relativity can see a part, and the quantum mechanics can also see a part. The more advanced and detailed research materials are still in the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the experiments demonstrated by the two girls, Lucien nodded and said: "Do you know the value of this research? This means you will get silver. The monthly medal, the magicians of the electromagnetic faction will fall in love with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, the sound of the air came from the side, Jerome and others did not Thinking of Katrina and Reyia, they can expect to get the Silvermoon Medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint, Heidi, Annick are a bit stunned, Mr. Jerome received the Holm Crown Award and they are convinced that he is dedicated to long-term Persevering in the rewards, and when he became a formal magician, he and others have not yet embarked on the magic path, nothing to be embarrassed, but the usual little friends, all the classmates, suddenly can get the highest honor in the electromagnetic field This made them feel complicated at the moment, especially Sprint, he was only promoted to the level of magician a little later than Annick, far more than others, but they were overtaken by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the project of the Atomic Research Institute. Lucien can't break the rules, flip through the papers, check the data, sign the name, and return it to the two girls: "You also signed your name, you are already The second ring magician is eligible to share this honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While watching Katrina and Reyia excitedly shaking hands, Lucien laughed Road: "You are here specifically waiting for me to come back to publish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is the experimental project you arranged, you are the first author without a doubt And getting your teacher's praise is more fun than getting the Silvermoon Medal," said Lei Yili. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled very well: "Wait until you submit it to the Magician Management Department. The next study can not relax, try to find Materials that can also exhibit superconductivity at higher temperatures, but you must also pay attention to the study and research in the microscopic field. This is the path you choose, the direction of improvement, and you must not slack off."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The two girls replied loudly and eagerly, and the joy was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Katrina thinks of something like saying: "Teacher, when we discovered superconductivity, there was a very defective model in the cognitive world. The feedback you described is still incomplete and it is impossible to complete it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is broken, have you studied the nature of superconducting arcane? Understand why low temperature Will there be superconductivity?" Lucien smiled and patted the shoulders of both of them. "Since it is difficult to complete it, then according to it, improve other electromagnetic magic, improve their power or reduce the difficulty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reyia hastened: "Teacher, can you ask me about improving the magic? We have no experience in this before."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have studied basic content at the Magic School, but since graduation, they have been doing things in atomic research, there is no urgent need to improve the magic, so the lack of experience in this area, the heart is inevitable At the end, subconsciously want the teacher to ask for advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am your teacher, have questions, but ask for advice." Lucian nodded, and was very curious about the broken model they got. Can you see if you can? According to it, the power of a little electromagnetic gun is improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the teacher’s affirmative answer, Katrina and Reyia came together happily to the magician management department, and Lucien looked back at Annick. Sprint, Heidi, and Cherie, keenly aware of the complex emotions in their hearts, smiled and said: "I am envious? Very embarrassing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Splint is like a needle, his back is sharp and straight, and he is holding his head: "No, I will definitely get the highest honor in different fields in the future, just like the teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s a bit awkward, I have to bully them at night, I have been stunned for so long!" Heidi admitted honestly, trying to hide the real with jokes. Mood, smile also revealed a bit uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick scratched his head and said: "It’s a bit of a bit, but I am satisfied with my research in the micro world, according to Mr. Lazar, Jay The description of Mr. Roma, Mr. Rock and other arcane masters, this is a world full of treasures, can you have a reward for your own efforts, I believe that there will be some achievements in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a little more than a person facing Lucian and the Institute of Atoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am very envious, but my research in this area is still superficial, it is normal for them to be kicked off by Katrina." Li's mentality is slightly better, but there is some gloom between the looks, which seems to be plagued by other problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked in his eyes, did not ask more, smiled: "I just returned from the space, who can tell me more than two months recently The latest research on surgery and magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremia said with a thick smile: "After your "New Alchemy" was published, the magician of the entire Magic Council It’s crazy, this is the realm of creation, so no matter what faction, as long as you know a little about elemental magic, you are studying your new alchemy, studying the microcosm, even those excellent arcans who have their own research directions. Also give energy to study and experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
