			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Felipe's view, the professor refused to admit defeat and was trying to save the final face. Because his request does not have any loss to himself, wouldn't he add a clause to the contract signed by the magic apprentice so that they cannot reveal the identity of the Sterk City contact to each other's students and friends? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have already harvested the real surname of the victory. It seems that there is no need to risk the tyrannical, mysterious and unpredictable enemy with great risk, and give the opponent a proper step. It is the choice of any sane wizard, especially the professor who shows unquestionable talent in the field of elements and necromantic magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just hesitating for a few seconds, Felipe smiled and said: "Okay, follow Mr. Professor’s request, because this is our previous life substance. The definitions were divided without prior agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he turned and said to all Necromancers and apprentices: "In the Pearl of the Sea" In the city of Stourke, there is a bank called 'Canjin'. Their owner, Mr. Glenueff, is one of the maintainers of the underground order of Stourke and the liaison of the Magic Council, responsible for arranging the official magician and Some lucky magic apprentices traveled through the church’s blockade to Aringe.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, Felipe spread his hand to Lucien : "I have completed my own bet, and I ask Mr. Professor to keep your promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at all Necromancer "angry" And the apprentices: "Your ignorance will eventually let you taste the bitter fruit, and the people who can’t distinguish between the enemy and the friends will always Live in misery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an excitement and joy to talk about the professor’s magic experiment. The expressions of the magicians and apprentices who did not overthrow the human life mechanics suddenly stiffened. It seems that I can't wait for someone to get rid of the pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people’s eyes become sad and desperate, but they can’t find any reason for the professor to help himself and others to rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innermost heart is full of joy, but the emotions that are exposed outside are extremely "angry". Lucian strode down the high platform and looked at the momentum and posture with the head back. Travel through the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Viscount Kareldia, please allow me to leave in advance." As a magician who was rated as very embarrassed, Lucien did not let himself How long does the anger stay for, because it is not real enough, but quickly calm down and say goodbye to the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia raised a cup with a little red wine: "Thank you, Professor, you let me see the latest achievements in the field of elemental magic. Failure is only temporary. I think that with your talent and strength, you will definitely become a famous figure in the history of magic. Well, Nieder, with Professor Mr. out of the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Viscount, your compliment." Lucien didn't dare to speak more, afraid to expose his inner ecstasy, and then walked to the door of the hall under the invitation of the neat housekeeper's respectful gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the innocent light of shame, depression, or despair, Lucien walked calmly in Felipe’s guarding eyes to prevent the professor’s sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly the Viscount Kareldia smiled: "Mr. Professor, I actually have one thing I always want to ask you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Lucien cursed the nickname of Karen Erdia, couldn’t he let himself quietly leave as a “loser”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount of Kareldia is slightly looking forward to the authenticity: "Mr. Professor, you have a faint, almost disappearing taste, which is familiar to me. I don't know if you know another man named Karendia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is puzzled: "Karendia is not uncommon. The surname, even in the Gust Empire, has a duke named Karendia. But when it comes to what I know, there is indeed a gentleman named Rhein Karendia."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinland is a dark creature, has a close relationship with this Viscount? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I didn’t think of this before is because this surname is too common, just like on Earth, Lucien meets someone named “李” They will not directly supplement them and they are relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien nodded. "Do you know Mr. Rhein?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia sighed on his forehead: "Of course, he is me." Grandpa, the words of your human relationship. But he has always left his descendants irresponsibly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True..." Xi'an's heart is filled, "There is a chance to meet in a thousand miles." And there is a sense of absurdity in which the generations are rising. After all, they and the Rhine are friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the professor’s grandfather who knows the Viscount of Carrendia, Felipe is increasingly affirming his strength and level of Arcane, and can have descendants of this rank. Mr. Rhein is at least a high-level vampire, and professors with such friends will naturally not go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please also ask Mr. Professor, tell me, where is my grandfather?" Viscount Karel Diadia looked at Lucien with a stunned look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was silent: "I saw Mr. Rhein in Aalto last time. As for now, I am not sure."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Professor Mr. Hehe, since you know my grandfather, why not stay in the castle?" Viscount Kareldia invited enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucien stay, and after the accident has reached its goal, this is the best chance to leave. I dare not pin my hopes on the "relatives" relationship between Viscount Kareldia and Rhein. If their relationship is really good, then why Rhein seems to have never returned to the castle: "Thank you for your kindness, But I didn't have the mood to stay here, and there are other tasks as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Kareldia did not insist, just smiled and said: "I hope that there will be Opportunity and Mr. Professor, you will meet again. May the Silver Moon protect you all the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded, Lucien’s back muscles were tight and he tried to maintain calm. Continue to follow Nieder's house, and I am extremely afraid that there will be other accidents. I don't have much confidence to face another change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there was no accident this time. Lucien left the hall and went to the gate of the old castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The back of the professor’s back disappeared in the darkness of the door. The “fat” muttered to himself: “If we just agree with Mr. Professor’s experiment, is it right? There is another result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think there may be a fierce magical battle, maybe it will affect us, because Mr. Felipe will never Retreat!” The Necromancer in front of them shook their head and sighed, “Now is probably the best result...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sethi and Tess, Sidney looked at each other and nodded lightly to each other. He understood that each other meant that Mr. Felipe had a good chance to overcome the professor. He tried to wait for himself without changing the main terms of the "Pale Hand" magic contract. People get better details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe put his hands in his trench coat pocket, smiled, and watched the professor leave as a winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Road Sean really disappeared at the door, his expression quickly gloomy and became ugly, and the fists in the windbreaker pocket were tight. Hold it. Regardless of whether the arcane masters and magicians in the hands of themselves and the pale hands are willing to admit that urea is a living matter, in the field of elemental magic, the professor’s magic experiment has already produced the results of subversion and surname, and will lead a battle. The trend of synthesizing various living things by elements or other non-living things, and the professors will receive countless praises and honors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these things, Felipe is still very self-aware and visionary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do human life mechanics say that it can withstand this storm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is young Magician, I can't be taught by the professor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............I left the gate of the city of Karentaldia, Lucien found himself In a completely strange mountain, there are tall trees everywhere, and you can't see the bright sky of silver moon and the sparkling lake before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Professor, the name of the castle is Amorecuk, an alchemy life." Because Lucien and the old Earl Rhein knew, Ned was very Dearly explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
