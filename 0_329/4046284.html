			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit world, Lucien puts his mind in order to find a room in this extremely monotonous and quiet Kuten Castle, waiting for Count Wit Carlylena, Ivanovsky, their things subsided, and the hunt began to relax before going out to meet with Leo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucian’s estimate, it takes about three or four days, and the meeting with Leo’s appointment is a week later, and the time is very good. It is just used to control the mental strength of this part of abnormal growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, after entering, it is the projection of the old castle, and there is Mr. Rhein here, otherwise according to Maskillin, the world of the dead is full. Undead, the deeper it is, the more dangerous it is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is glad that he has no experience with the dead, except that he is not a fighting mad, but more I like to study quietly and enjoy life. It is also very self-aware. I know that with my current strength, it is difficult to compete with well-known undead creatures such as demons, ghosts, mummies, death knights, etc., so that they can not touch the dead spirit. It is best not to run into it, who knows if they will summon each other and come to a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stepping on the gray and gloomy stairs, the whole dry vine castle suddenly swayed, like a fishing boat in the sea that was hit by storms and storms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tear in the old castle, and it was divided into countless shadows to slide in the distance, and disappeared in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process, the speed is far faster than the response of Lucien, even the last "strong flame shield" did not have time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden exposure to Lucien in the wilderness, feeling the stagnation of the dead spirits as solidified, a bit blankly inside: " What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand pale white tears highlight, Lu Xien suddenly felt a fresh breeze around himself, let himself be dead The mental power and blood power of the sudden death and monotonous depression have been greatly restored, just like the summer heat, a refreshing cool breeze blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The blessing of the little girl is really good in this environment." Lucien thought happily, while looking around, found that it is similar to the western mining of the Ural City. The black and white ash zone, so I don’t doubt to confuse myself, "This is the normal reflection of the main material world..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lucien’s understanding, Although the dead spirits are mixed with the non-intelligent things that reflect the main material world, often a building is reflected from the west of the city to the north of the city. However, this kind of patchwork and mixing seems to have a certain scope limit, which is probably limited to one city. Inside a small town. Therefore, from the cracks in the mine into the dead spirits, but directly to the Ulaer City, the projection of the old castle, the road has always been confusing: "This confusion and deviation is too big?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the castle of Kuto is self-disintegrating and slipping away, Lucien finally understands: "Probably for some reason, Mr. Rhein moved the Utchi Castle together when he projected, waiting for him. Disappeared, the castle quickly restored its original position under the force of rejection of the dead spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this is also good, it is difficult to thoroughly The traces of Ivanovsky’s remnants that have been erased have really disappeared, and there is no need to worry about being discovered... not good!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly shocked, Woke up and immediately rushed to the gap between the dead spirits not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Ivanovsky knows the realm of the dead, knowing that there is a gap in the depths of the mine to the dead, then what about his associates? For example, the high-ranking magician Nikonov knows not to know? If he is clear, it is likely to choose to enter the dead spirit to avoid, and after the bottom of the mine, the traces of his own battle with Ivanovsky will not tell him clearly that there are enemies here. ! The secrets of the dead spirit world may have been exposed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this secret exposure, to Nikonov, to Ivanovsky’s companion, to the big man behind Ivanovsky They are all more serious things that have been destroyed by the Earl of Vivet. They will never let go of anyone who might know the secrets of the Necromancers. This will lead to a crazy pursuit of them - regardless of the emphasis of the Rhine. Or Lucien’s own cognition, no doubt points to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Nikonov or someone else perceives himself and hides in the realm of the dead, they will definitely search nearby and arrange induction traps at the exit. Then, you will either fall into a situation that is more dangerous than the previous Futeng Castle, or you can only hide in other parts of the Necromancer to find another exit gap. In this way, you may encounter a strong high-order immortality. biological! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucien stepped into the gap, he carefully sensed the outside environment through the hustle and bustle, and waited until no one was confirmed before inspiring the last "strong flame shield" of this time, passing through a thick and gloomy curtain. ", back to the bottom of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no wind, the deep yellow-green "demonous fog" has not completely dissipated, corroding rocks, poisoning insects, mice and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit has moved, the soul has enhanced a lot of Lucien more easily ignited the "dispersion of smoke", the cast buffer is a little shorter than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After and after the "dispersing smoke", "Gaston's poisonous fog" finally disappeared, Lucien began to systematically deal with the remains of rats and insects. , deal with the mine wall corroded by fog, and deal with all the battle marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ivanovsky’s companionship may come, but Lucien is still very calm, no fuss, no panic, only used no In ten minutes, the traces were cleaned with a few special magic. As long as the other party does not check carefully, it will be difficult to detect, especially as the time goes by, the less likely it is to be aware of the clues. In the end, if it is not pre-informed, it will be normal to look at it with the nine-ring magic "backtracking visual". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Lucien carefully examined it again, then applied invisibility and was ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few steps, on the road to the bottom of the mine, Nikonov’s breath suddenly appeared, and Lu Xi’an was shocked: “He really Come here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is believed that there is no other person at the bottom of the mine, or perhaps full confidence in their own strength, Nikonov does not have any cover-up Signs, this made Lucien a lot of time to notice, and at the same time, because Lucien had been invisible and cover-up, and the distance was far away, Nikonov failed to find him in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to hide?" Lucien quickly looked around, and the mental field was recovered, so as not to be touched by Nikonov. "Can’t be like before. Hiding Ivanovsky is like stealing, remote corners and controlling emotions. This is a high-level magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental field of the high-level magician As the essence, it can clearly sense every creature in a small range, and the bottom of such a narrow mine hole, unless you use the four-ring magic "high invisibility", there is a slight possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around, confirming that no other road has escaped, Lucien decisively re-entered the world of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Black and white gray is unchanged, a clump of shrubs solidified on the ground without any swing, Lucien dragged a shallow residual image, toward The plains rushing down, because there is most likely to encounter undead creatures there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not avoid the dead spirit this time, but specifically to find them, at the same time, the crystal ball flew up, surrounded by the Maskillin star, they two Two collisions, annihilated together, made Lucien a "lucky" point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who never believed in the fate arrangement, did his best, and never surrendered before the so-called fate! Even if you die, you must be worthy of yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos of the dead, the mountain is not high. In a short time, Lucien reached the plains and saw a group of ghouls. Their rotten skin and muscles, the eyes that are about to fall out, are so "friendly and lovely." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't find them, Lucien can only avoid the nearby rocky places of the Dwarf Mountains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghouls smelled the spirit of life, and suddenly they were restless, and they seemed to be mad at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien read a silent mantra, and the breath changed immediately. The rich death and decaying air suddenly surrounded, and the body began to change. The group of carrion appeared, and soon became a decaying rotten ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council has a unique two-ring magic "deformation undead!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new kind of magic that combines the two ancient inheritance magics of "undead mask" and "disguise undead creature", with their own characteristics, one is death Energy entanglement, one is the shape of the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
