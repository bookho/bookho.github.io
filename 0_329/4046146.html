			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the building of the late Twilight War, the interior of Baron Habero’s castle also inherits the distinctive features of this style, the wide and solemn hall, narrow and small The windows at the heights together create a dark and mysterious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Baron is waiting for the distinguished guests in the small restaurant on the second floor." Karin stretched out her right hand and smiled at the stairs at the edge of the hall. The halls of the building are mainly used by dance parties and village courts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has been a princess consultant for half a year, and is familiar with all kinds of occasions and various manners. With a smile on his head, he walked slowly to the stairs behind the back of Kailin. Wise seems to have experienced similar banquets. It seems calm and calm. Betty looks at the hall full of hundreds of people, secretly vomiting his tongue, and even her calm sister and brother-in-law can't help but look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stairs, it is a long corridor, the candlesticks on both sides have been lit, illuminating the dark environment of the evening, while the two sides of the wall are suspended by Habe The portrait of Baron Baro reflects the dim candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was the first generation of Baron Habero, who was enshrined in the late Twilight War. Their family's blood is very powerful, and it is said to have petrified themselves and The ability of others." Simon whispered to Lucien, the heroic deeds of Baron Habero in the Djibouti Principality is widely circulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave a slight look at the oil paintings on both sides: "Is it a contact attack or a long-range attack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short and professional questions, Simon increasingly believes that Lucien is a nobleman who has experienced good and regular knight training: "Mr. Evans, when Baron Habero was active, I was not born yet. There is a description in the poet's story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded lightly, no longer asked, Lucien continued to follow behind Kailin, who seemed to have heard nothing before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the oil paintings, the Baron Habero painted vividly, passing through them, giving the illusion of being watched, making people fearful Feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Karin pushed the door to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two iron-red wooden doors slowly separated on both sides, revealing a magnificent and luxurious restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long dining table in the depths of the restaurant. The white and delicate porcelain tableware, cutlery and candles are placed on the table. Several well-dressed maids are close to the wall. Stand by. In addition to the dining table, there is an indoor small band that plays melodious music, making the atmosphere of the whole party elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are soldiers guarding the soldiers on both sides of the gate. They just take away the prominent weapons such as the long swords that Lu Xien and others are carrying, and there is no such thing as a hidden dagger. attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark-haired old man came over with a few waiters. He wore a brown robes that were popular during the Twilight Wars. His face was ruddy and his body was calm and powerful. There are only a few wrinkles on the quaint face, and it is completely invisible to be more than seventy years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to my guests, your arrival has revived my dying old guy." The Baron Habero’s voice was welcoming, with gray eyes. No turbidity, only the right middle finger up and down with a green jade seal ring, simple and generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your invitation, Baron." Under the leadership of Lucien, everyone returned in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Habero looked at Lucien intently: "You should be Mr. Evans? Nice, young and handsome, with extraordinary strength, arms and legs." They all contain a powerful force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, while seriously looking at Lucien’s arms, chest, thighs and face, he saw Lucy. In my heart, I said: "Is this old guy not a man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien was seen as disgusting and ready to stop Baron Habero finally turned his head and greeted other people, starting with Wise, followed by Simon and Joanna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last call to Betty, Habero began to look up and down, like a purebred pervert, see Betty show round, will soon erupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a reasonable explanation, Betty put away the anger, Lucian also dispelled the suspicion that Baron Habero likes men, but still has a little inexplicable feeling, resulting in a faint repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of Mrs. Kelin and the waiter, Lucien and others sat in the position on both sides of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Baron, why didn't you see your housekeeper, Mr. Cook?" Lucien asked with a slight doubt after laying the napkin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the normal aristocrat entertains the guest, the details should be the housekeeper, not the housekeeper. Although there are female guests, it is not surprising that the housekeeper's wife is helping to arrange, but it is very rude to have the butler not appearing. As a guest of competent etiquette, you must ask the owner at this time. Of course, the reason why Lucien asked this is mainly because of the faint repression of the heart, and I want to find out what is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Baron Habero swayed in the shadow of the candlelight in front of him: "Oh, Cook just went out to work, will come back tomorrow morning. If Mr. Evans, you are willing to let me entertain you for a day, I should be able to see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he pointed to an old-fashioned man who came over the piano. The old man said: "This is my music consultant, Mr. Mars, a famous musician in Coser."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This musician Mars seems to be young To sixty, but the wrinkles on the face and the white hair on the head are significantly more than the seventeen-year-old Baron Habero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After greeting each other, Mars couldn’t help but complain: "The baron, you can buy this 'piano' can not match the harpsichord. The sound quality is not good enough..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a year of communication, the piano is almost popular among wealthy families on the mainland, even though Baron Habero is near this mountain. The nobility also began to chase this trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of complaints, Betty suddenly interrupted: "In fact, Mr. Mars, you have not used the pedals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Does she like others to criticize Lucien? Mr. Evans is good at musical instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars frowned. "This lady, music is not a professional. It is best not to talk indiscriminately. I don't think I am not using the pedal." He has a good demeanor, no direct criticism, only a little arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not what I said, it was just sneaked to me by Mr. Wise. He is a music literate gentleman!" Betty sold out without hesitation. Wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars turned his eyes to Wise and sought his explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise smiled and spread his hands: "In fact, I don't know music too much, I just learned piano recently..." He said, he said With a professional theory, people outside of Mars and Lucien are dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is listening to the white water, listening with interest, these controversies have appeared in many newspapers of Alto, and can finally be their own concert The successful piano solo is completely shattered. Br 哎 哎 哎 哎 哎 严肃 严肃 严肃 严肃And countless people, I will never forget, there will be no such exciting scenes now. Mr. Christopher, Mr. Leandro, Ms. Rania, Mr. Jonescu... Many great musicians have together embarked on an era that cannot be surpassed. Unfortunately, such an era has ended like the inevitable death of each of us. In the debate, Baron Habero expressed his opinion. He used to go to Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty immediately responded: "I don't think it is an era that cannot be surpassed. Brand new music, new genre, countless possibilities, now is the most vitality of music. At the time! Even Mr. Christopher accepted the theme music, Mr. Evans will not be worse than those great musicians! The end of the past era is over, there is no pity!” She completely forgot that the opposite is a Baron adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before dinner, except for Lucien, everyone joined the debate and became fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
