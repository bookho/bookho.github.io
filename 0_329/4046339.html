			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half-masking and throwing out his own "guess", the study room is quiet, it seems that even the air is completely solidified, and does not transmit a slight faint sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atomic point of view, directly abandoning the core definition of "atoms", one of the foundations of modern arcaneism, Lucien thought he was too crazy "idea" "There will be roaring and accusation, but Fernando keeps a smile, and the red pupil seems to be able to see through his eyes as if he can see through the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as this unspeakable pressure made Lucien a little breathless, the storm dominated Fernando and nodded lightly: "In fact, the law of the elemental cycle was After you discovered it, after a long discussion, I reached a consensus with Hathaway. If I want to continue to study the related issues in the atomic field, I must temporarily forget some of the inherent cognition. Among them, the atom is the substance. The definition of the most basic components, which do not help solve the problem, will hamper our thinking. And the premise of our consensus is based on the 'most basic should be the most concise' concept you just mentioned." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Lucien didn't expect the two Arcanists to take a step forward on the road to abandon the definition of the atomic theory. They are not afraid of cognition. The world is shaking and subverting, blowing up your own head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s a feeling of Lucian’s doubts, Fernando reveals a kind of cynical smile: “Luxian, don’t you think we are these big arcans Are they stubborn, refuse to accept any new ideas, and are unwilling to admit their idiots that they have misunderstood in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't wait for Wayne to answer, he He also smiled and said: "Be able to stand at the top of this world, close to the essence of all things, we all understand that if truth is a vast starry sky, then we only see some stars, we must always be humble and An open attitude, when abandoned, resolutely abandon. Since you have seen the problem, you can't pretend to turn a blind eye, but you should study why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To make the legend The magician’s cognitive world collapses, and it must completely subvert the basis of their understanding, and it will come with a strong evidence to a sudden impact. Otherwise, some of the legendary cognitive world will be damaged and solidified. Ascension. Of course, perhaps we have not explored enough, and there has not been a new cognition that makes everyone confused, shaken, and incomprehensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando The description of the cognitive world seems to be somewhat different from that that Lucien knew in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Relatively, the legendary magicians are equally persistent in their views. There is no complete and rigorous and tangible proof that they cannot shake their attitude. I and the sea." Seville is also a consensus that has been gradually reached with the deepening of research, the discovery of problems, and the contradictions in philosophical speculation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the words, Lucien thought thoughtfully, this is the contradiction between insistence and modesty that the teacher said before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando concluded by summing up: "In every heart of the Arcanist, there is a sentence inscribed, 'Sometimes, past experience and knowledge are instead we advance The obstacles '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the storm dominated, Lucien quietly sighed, revealing a "truthful" smile: "Teacher, since you and Heather Lord Wei is so close to me from the atomic point of view, can you support me to establish the 'Atomic Research Institute'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that it is not enough to rely on one point of view. What kind of novelty do you have for Lucien?” Fernando smiled like an old fox, and felt that Lucien’s mind was full of novel ideas, and then squeezing it might lead to a point of inspiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien resolutely shook his head: "Teacher, no, so we have to build the 'Atomic Research Institute' and slowly explore."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's do it, Lucien, before you become a five-ring, I will look at the performance you followed with me, or else I will not be able to get any of the atomic research institutes I support. It will be laughed at by other legendary magicians." Fernando's "small man, good performance" of the wretched smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien understands that this implies the meaning of the exam, Zheng focus: "Teacher, I will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least before the promotion of the ranks, his mathematical foundation, as well as the knowledge of the elements, electromagnetic and other magic, is absolutely sufficient, the main problem is the relatively good astrology, entangled in fate, blessing, curse That piece is somewhat difficult to integrate with celestial mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want to change?" Fernando was exaggerated and surprised. "Only your signature is of course grandiose, big and empty. If you add the signature of support with Hathaway, it is a big-eyed, deep-minded, make up for the parliament. The lack of arcane research projects has opened up new forms of research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu Xien was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Lucien, you come to read these letters, read a letter." Fernando leaned back on the high back chair, eyes closed, as if falling into Contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why Fernando did not choose to read this more convenient way, but let him read the letter, he is not the kind of person, but full of heart Douban, who was puzzled, still picked up the first one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan Xiu's beautiful handwriting is reflected in the pupil, Lu Xien randomly aiming at the envelope, which reads "Yaluolan? Hathaway? Hoffenberg" first name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The letter between the Arcanists also let me read, not afraid to reveal secrets?" The strong surprise made Lucien a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick reading." Fernando urged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retracted his surprise and doubts and read it from the beginning: "Fernando, according to your opinion, I tried to improve the design of the magic array so that it can be separated. A more subtle difference, the following is the improved magic array..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading read, Lucien is both surprised and funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amazed that the problem that the two Arcanists discussed was one of the research directions that the Atomic Research Institute intended: Separating isotopes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the application of the periodic table of elements in practice, more and more arcaneists realize that the atomic quantity that does not change the part of the data is indeed present. The mistake is that the current method is difficult to correct, while Fernando and Hathaway noticed that the problem was concentrated on the atomic weight. Because the atomic mass is reflected as the mass of an object, they try to remove the "impurities" by electromagnetic, centrifugal, etc. - only the legendary magician can establish the applicable magic array under the current conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien feels funny because Hathaway’s writing level is somewhat inconsistent with her identity as a great arcian, often the words are unsatisfactory, the language is dull, not It does not rely on a large number of magic symbols to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lun’s finished, Fernando smiled narrowly: “Every time reading Hathaway’s papers and letters is always tough, she is said to be a princess. At the time, the literature class never passed. Each of her papers had to be retouched by her students or the little guys like Morris, otherwise there would be no way to publish them in the journal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the secret of the Arcanist, will it be ruined? Lucien thought humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, what do you think about the content of this letter? I remember you mentioned this possibility in the first place." Fernando asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien organized the language: "In this way, the greater the difference in quality, the easier it is. You should choose heavy elements to experiment..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lecture, Fernando asked Lu Xien about several places in the paper. If Lu Xien could not answer, he explained in detail, even combined with the magic array experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the question was over, Fernando slowly dictated and wrote a letter from Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien finally understood why Fernando wanted to let himself read the letter. He guided himself through the most cutting-edge exchanges between legendary magicians. Augmentation and vision when learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such guidance must be based on the premise that the disciple’s own arcane foundation is solid, otherwise it is purely “playing the cow”, so Lucien reads the second letter. At that time, I played a full-fledged spirit and became dedicated, lest I be asked to be speechless and scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The author of the second letter is more famous, and the meticulously written handwriting reads "Derrick Douglas." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
