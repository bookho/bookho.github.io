			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opening of the door, a warm yellow glow slowly emerges, illuminating the entire magic laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clean and tidy, with many utensils and alchemy arrays, although there is no “prophet” Maskillin’s magic experiment in the “big cross-frame” lock The room is so mysterious and grand, but it doesn't know how many times better than Lucy's own apprenticeship lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K refers to one of the alchemy platforms: "Lu Xien, huh, there is a feeling of shouting yourself, you use it to refine magic potions, I am going to start the magic experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Lucien didn't ask much, rushing to inquire about other people's experimental content in the Magic Council, but the biggest prohibition One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are often some people who are not so good. The magician is quietly inquiring about the direction and content of others' experiments, and then designing similar magic experiments, pre-writing and publishing papers. Skill points, arcane points and status glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because it is easy to be confused with the situation of simultaneously performing a direction of arcane research but preemptively obtaining results. The evidence is difficult to define unless it is directly determined by magic such as investigative thinking. . The magician who dares to do this has the support of a certain powerful force behind him. Without sufficient evidence, he can completely refuse to accept magic such as investigative thoughts. The excuse is also easy to find, for example, he has some great magic and magic. The secrets of the remains, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the magician who snatched the results of other people's arcane research, because of the narrow mind, worried that the original magician would revenge after growing up, so Try to get rid of it at your feet, or let it "disappear" by sending a seemingly less dangerous task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things, Lazar said to Lucien when they introduced the common sense of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Kingshi" magic potion is only to help the mental strength to be stable, the requirements are not high, Lucien is a skilled hand refining a lot of pharmacy, after three failures, Successfully refining a brown turbid magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the time is still early, Lucien took out a piece of purified elemental material, prepared to follow the papers and determine the various surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, K, who is facing away from Lucien, suddenly said: "Lu Xien, are there any other magic experiments besides refining magic potions? Do you want to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I don't want to inquire about your content, but if you do have an experiment that you must do, I can take this magic lab. The 'secret lock' opening method tells you that you can use this magic lab even if I can't come later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is low and generous Resounding in the magic lab gives a feeling of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, K. I just touched the elemental foundation and wanted to experiment with each element’s surname. You know, I only have one ring. The level of magic, many surnames can not be determined by their own magic, can only rely on the magical array and alchemy array in the laboratory." Lucian did not be tempted, turned around, and frankly answered, this is also for himself later The results of the research have laid the foundation, and at least many people have proved that they have spent a lot of time to verify the surname of the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you really need this kind of experiment to eliminate the error and judge whether the various elements of the world are regular. If there is, it will mean a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after Lun’s turn, see K is still doing experiments, so he turned around to show that he did not spy on the content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will tell you how to open the secret lock." K's experiment seems to have entered a stage of waiting for a result, so he can separate the spirit. Conversation, in the same way, he also worried about the misunderstanding of the content of Lucian magic potions, did not turn around, "However, I may leave Douglas Magic School a few months later, can not let Lucien you continue to use this laboratory "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the alchemy array to turn a small amount of purified elements into steam, and measured the gas density by measuring the alchemy array, while wondering curiously: " K, are you leaving? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my previous paper was approved by a disciple of a member of the committee. He Mr. Larry, who is the will of our elements, told me that if I could become a mid-level magician, he would let me follow him to study and study, and I recently felt that I was getting closer to the third ring, so I wanted to pass Complete a task to get an item to help Promotion. "K did not mean to show off slowly explained, but the verbal skills lacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien turned his back to K and nodded. "Thank you very much. Oh, what is your paper? I want to find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I haven't published yet, I have to wait for the next week's "Elements" journal. When the school has free to watch." K was a little embarrassed about Lucien's inquiry, did not directly say the title of the paper, "I hope Lu Xien You can complete the basic experiment as soon as possible, otherwise you will have to compete with other teachers to seize the speed of the lab after I leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed "It turned out to be the "Elements" journal. No one in the school knows, K is very secret. Well, I will hurry to finish the experiment. K, you are a good person who loves to help others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing. I just hope that everyone will try to help others when they are capable and not delaying their own affairs." K smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are facing each other, occasionally chatting, but more focused on their own experiments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ When Lucien returned to the garden villa, it was already early in the morning, and Rock had fallen asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint floral scent, the pleasant tranquility makes Lucien’s mental state quickly adjusted to the best, then open the glass tube and succulent brown The "hard rock" pharmacy drank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sour and pungent tastes such as sour and spicy in the mouth of the road, in the throat, tumbling, let him almost vomit, but a strange ice Cooling wrapped the spirit of Lucien to make it more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alleviate the taste, close your eyes, Lucian quickly enters meditation, still the starry sky, the gravity of the Star of Destiny and the surrounding fire, wind, water The three basic forces constitute a complete meditation environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness seems to be detached from the soul, calmly commanding beside it, the mental power vibrates, and the soul changes, and a star-shaped light ray appears, forming a rather Complex stereo spell model. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no complicated problems such as curves have been involved, Lucien constructed this spell model with ease, and after more than a month, constructed graphics for the existing arcane base. Learning and making up the meaning, etc., some of the previous problems are solved very easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the closure of the last line, the complex spell model is shaped, and the illusory radiance shines, dragging the consciousness of Lucien’s onlooker into the soul. Wrap the whole soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien’s consciousness is a subtle change in the meditation environment that senses the outer sky and the feng shui! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of different colors of light particles emerged leisurely, and there seems to be a sequence of deep mystery between them, showing a complex structure figure that is difficult to describe. It seems to represent a magic that Lucien has never seen before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its construction is so vague, so confusing, when Lucien wants to see clearly, consciousness has been the first two-ring magic "mirror" The soul and spiritual power brought about by the change is overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of violent waves is like the first movement of the symphony of destiny played by Lucien, and it continues to be continuous. Lucien is like the sea. The sailboat thrown up by the wind and waves can only stay awake and not stun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Lucien has suffered a lot of blows and dangers, and his spirit and will have been tempered and tough, and there is a reluctance in the heart. Supported the illusory light disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A transparent and beautiful crystal was born in the soul of Lucien, and the changes in mental power and soul reached the limit without being weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s finally a second-ring magician." Lucien said, while he had a figure that was exactly the same and difficult to distinguish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mirror Vision", the second-circle illusion, can help the body resist the attack before being cracked by the horoscope's prophetic detection spells such as 'true knowledge'. If the attack cannot break the image, then it won't hurt the ontology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After feeling the second ring magic, Lucien lifted the "mirror shadow" and re-entered into meditation, but the little color light that he saw before The grain disappeared, and it was still the original environment, as if there had been an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
