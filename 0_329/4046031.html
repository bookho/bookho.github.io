			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the witch’s magic notes, there are more than a dozen magical agents, each of which has wonderful effects, such as the “brown owl” that restores mental strength. The most precious three are the "Magic Gate" potions that help the magic apprentices who have a hard-to-understand understanding of the spell structure, the magic moon apprentice's "Silver Moon" potion, and a normal physical fitness. Adults directly stimulate the "crying soul" of blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the most exciting thing for Lucien is the "Crying Soul" magic potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Gate of Magic" and "Silver Moon" not only require precious materials, but are difficult to find in a short time, and the premise of using them is both mental and spiritual. Close to the official magician, only the "Crying Soul" potion, normal adults can use after a certain amount of exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the product of ancient magicians who have to study the need to rapidly train low-level waiters in certain situations, to stimulate the blood at the expense of the potential of the body. Strength, so the negative effect is very strong, once you use the "Crying Soul" to promote the Cavaliers, you will no longer be able to improve your blood strength through exercise, and the strength is worse than the normal Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this pair has not much hope to become a knight, and Lucine, who chose the magic road, has little problem, and it is a quick increase in strength in a short time. Way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the material needed for this magical potion is either very expensive or very weird, and it’s also very difficult for Lucien to be a trainee magic apprentice who wants to collect it. If the body is not up to the standard of normal adults, then after drinking the magic potion, not only will there be a great chance of failure, but it will endanger life. Adults with normal constitution have a certain chance of failure, and the better the constitution. The easier it is to succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Crying Soul" magic potion is an outstanding achievement of Necromancer magic. The simple magic formula is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Black corpse mushroom + water ghost brain tissue + Wraith dust + Moonlight Rose powder == "Crying Soul"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, black nectar is a kind The strange mushroom that grows on the rotting corpse is milky white before it matures. After maturity, it will turn black all day, and it will remain for one month without wilting. The smell is slightly illusory, and it will directly eat the poison of the carrion. The darker the black hens are, the better the "crying soul" effect of the final refining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water ghost brain tissue is the brain organization of the undead creatures. The more powerful the water ghost, the better the "crying soul" effect that is finally refined. The same is true for dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Moonlight Rose, according to the witch, is a rare plant that emits silvery, moonlight colors at night, when high-ranking knights motivate blood. , it has a supporting effect, so it is very expensive, more expensive than the materials that many formal magicians can use. One gram is a Jintal, that is, one hundred Yinnar, and when used, on the premise of success, It takes at least 10 grams to refine the magic potion, and the high-level knight attends the whole process of stimulating the blood power, according to its own ability, from burning five grams to fifty grams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women once thought about refining the "Crying Soul" magic potion to quickly improve their strength, and then they can look for "ice-shaped gorse" afterwards. After all, the first-order knight Strength, in the entire Vaurit Principality can be regarded as a strong, is a real aristocracy, from these days of knowledge, Lu Xien knows that all the knights of the Principality are added up, there are only more than 400, of course, In Aalto, there are many powerful people who have more strength than ordinary knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the witch can’t afford Moonlight Rose for the time being, and the other three materials, I heard that the Belem River will be a ghost in the night, and know that the Wraith dust can pass. The apprentice-level magic of "Summoning Low-Order Undead" is completed with the "Blood of the Evil Creature" and has to be put on hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Lucien can only continue his magical learning first, focusing on meditation, spelling training and magic experiments, and secretly searching for these materials. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the "Fire of the Fire" (July), the sky is bright Very early, the clouds like orange ruby ​​slowly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien started earlier, and has experimented with a mental vibration frequency instead of a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you use spells to cast spells, three times 'the ring of out of control' will exhaust the mental power, and you can use the mental force to vibrate in advance to cast spells. A 'runaway loop' can make me feel dry, unless it is special, it is not very useful. Lu Xien commented on this without disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a meditation temper, Lucien’s spirit recovered, and he packed up the messy cottage for the “out of control ring” magic, and went out to the home of Eliza. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Big Brother Lucien, have breakfast together!" Ai Wen opened the wooden door to Lucien, who recently followed Alice in Al The textile company will help, and it looks a lot more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "Of course, I chose to come over, how can I miss my breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, little Evans, you are getting more and more humorous. It seems that this week of study makes you confident. Would you like to pray together tomorrow morning?" Joel is drinking and cooking. The soft brown bread of wild vegetable soup is very satisfying to the maturity and confidence that Lucien can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every week in the morning, the Truth believers will unite to the church to pray, and most of them will have time and conditions to go, only Lucien, from Since crossing, I have been worried about being discovered and always shirking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice took a wooden spoon and took a bowl of this wild vegetable soup to Lucien: "Little Evans, you sit down and eat slowly, eat Said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien last night to today, meditation and casting consume a lot of physical strength, no polite, drink a bite with satisfaction, chew the black bread Eat it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black bread of Alice's big family, although it is also very rough, difficult to eat, also has bran and other impurities, but compared to Lucian's inferior black The bread-like taste of the bread is so much better that Lucine can't help but secretly curse (female + dry) business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Joel, I am not free tomorrow, I am afraid I can't go to church with you." How can Lucien go to church, not mention danger, light It was enough time to learn a lot of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is amazed: "Little Evans, what are you doing tomorrow? Do you find a job without going to the market area?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Joel and Ivan are all looking puzzled, Lucien took the old and plain money bag and handed it to Joel, laughing very well. "Uncle Joel, I am now an official student of Mr. Victor, and Mr. Victor is very good, and I have forgiven my tuition. These eight Yinar are back to you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, cough, you become the official student of Mr. Victor?!" Joel was almost smashed by the black bread, coughing, his face flushed, looking at Lucien His eyes are full of shock, how many days? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Eliza is surprised at another point: "Free tuition?! You can learn without paying Silver?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivan is still unclear about the meaning of the words of Lucien, and sneak a look at the purse: "Wow, it’s really Silver, a cute silver ner with a beautiful glow. Brother Lu Xien, what do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien honestly told the experience of the day, there is no need to hide the place, In conclusion, "Well, just like this, Mr. Victor asked me to follow him to learn words and music, and to avoid tuition. I am going to Mr. Victor tomorrow morning, borrowing some simple books from GM, and getting started with music. Books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this afternoon, Lucien is going to the Victor home to fill the last hour of study that was not completed yesterday, but to be honest, there is no reason to push I’m going to go to church, and Lucien is really going to go to Victor’s house tomorrow morning, since I’ve chosen to use a musician or The identity of the musician to cover up the identity of the magician, the basic music common sense, introductory knowledge, music scores, etc. should be added to the library as soon as possible, so that he is like a poor child who grew up in Aalto, not different The traversal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "swindler" line, Lucien is still very dedicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Victor is really a good person." Because Lucien tried to hide his role, Eliza praised Mr. Victor for coming. Little Evans, you have to thank the Lord. After so many hardships, you can finally start a new and beautiful life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
