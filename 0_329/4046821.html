			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim underground palace, the pillars of light mixed with flames are constantly being blown down, deep and dark as the first snow meets the sun, and all kinds of strange worms are stiff. The petrified, sinister shadows made a fierce cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer of light flashed, a priest floating in the air suddenly fell, like being dragged by the ankle, the defense The layer did not have any effect, and most of the sorcerers came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have a reaction in the future, they see the imposing blonde middle-aged man in front of his right hand, the five fingers apart, each finger highlights a small The eyes, while the palm of the hand grows a yellow-brown giant eye mixed with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five weird and horrible little eyes have different colors, and they have different rays, while the yellow-brown giant eyes have a ray of light, making everyone feel The body is heavy, it seems that the gravity here has become a lot bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green, light blue and other different rays hit the black robes, let them either slow, paralyzed, or petrified, or directly turned into countless light In a moment, the former priest, the bishop, the paladin, and the ordinary night watchman could not completely solve the strong enemy, and they will soon be victorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cultists shouted in panic, they have never encountered such a powerful enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big, high priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't the high priest stop him?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the crucial moment, they thought of the leader of their own side, the supreme "post-chaos" voters, wasn’t he fighting with the majestic middle-aged man? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man in a white full-length robes heard their call and stepped up his attack, growing one face and the other. Only the evil little eyes, the small eyes of different colors, the rays of defense or attack, and coldly shouted: "Only the cult priests of the seventh level can stop me? I killed the priests who are stronger than him. There are twenty or thirty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? After confirming the death of the high priest, the spiritual defenses of these cultists and priests suddenly fell, and even prayed for power after "chaos", and they rushed to the panic. They quickly lost their fighting power, being watched by night priests and pastors. And the paladins caught and killed, no one slipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼· Recently this kind of inexplicable - there are too many cults to emerge, you must find the roots!" The majestic middle-aged man's face and hand let The creepy eyes closed and no traces were seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night watchman gratefully said: "This time thanks to the adults you are nearby, or else we are likely to be escaped by the priests after this 'chaos.'" In fact, it’s not just the problem of escape, it will definitely be destroyed. Fortunately, the night watchman’s third-ranked “Glory Eye” Winchel is from another The clues have been traced to avoid such terrible consequences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am responsible for dealing with the cultists, it is my duty to deal with them." Winchel gently sighed. "You divide into groups and search around. Let go of any cultist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adult." The night watchman captain responded respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterel walks in this hall, watching chaotic altars engraved with female and male nudes, looking for clues for investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the magnificent but old-fashioned underground palace, looking at the dark but inverted corpse environment, looking at the ancient stone gate and one In the room of Stone, Winchel’s heart is inexplicably a little emotional. This scene has been encountered too many times. Whether it is the previous adventure or the action of clearing the cult after entering the night watchman, it is inevitable with the underground palace. Fight, secret room, hide secrets, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn ancient wizards always like to dig holes in the ground..." Winchel cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his heart moved, his eyes became like rubies, and he shot two rays. He directly shattered a nearby wall to reveal the hidden door inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning a corner, Winchel showed a cultist with a horrified look in front of them, who were drilling into a secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Winchel sneered and wanted to escape from me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense eyes opened again, and one cultist fell to the ground. Winchel broke into the Chamber of Secrets, constantly moving forward, chasing the enemy in the forefront, behind those Naturally, the loss of combat power is handled by the clergy who follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chase, the cults in front are getting scarce, and then no one can be seen, but Winchel does not stop, his instinct tells him that there is still Big fish, the same big fish as the previous "elector." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰, a stone door with a pattern was shattered by rays, and Winchel entered the deepest secret room, watching the surroundings with vigilance, but there is only one holding here. There is no other cultist in the "post-chaos" statue that burns the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come? Winchel looked around in a slight stun, as a golden knight, even though he was more inclined to cast spells, he was very confident in his instincts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cool breeze blew, and the golden knight of Winchel couldn’t help but shudder, and for the first time tonight, it’s dangerous. Premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This premonition is not strong, Wincher did not escape immediately, but played a defensive ray, leaving himself surrounded by "iron wall" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around, Winchel only saw lifeless walls, quiet and empty rooms, ordinary rough statues, and no source of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this cold and cold no one feels that he is guilty inside, can't help but step back a few steps, just then, "after chaos" statue holding The flame of the group suddenly plunged high, burning and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment, Winchel intuitively feels the danger of being inexcusable, a few hundred or even thousands of times stronger than before, even if he is often The night watchman who wandered on the edge of danger could not help but tremble slightly. He understood a lot of things. Before he was dangerous, he was obviously not disturbed by human beings, and he was able to interfere with his existence so effectively. He was definitely not able to compete. Just like the priest just facing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the slight trembling, Winchel’s strong will helped him stabilize his emotions, and the rich experience made him see the problems, such a presence It’s easy to get yourself and lock in your position. It’s easy to kill yourself, but he spends more energy to seduce himself out of the team. It’s obviously another purpose to enter the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" he asked tentatively, his eyes flowing out of dirty liquid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the group is high in adult shape, and the voice is old and hoarse: "It doesn't matter who I am. What matters is what I can give you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I am the Lord's Dark Guard, preferring to die and not dealing with the Devil." Winchel completely ruled out the possibility of the devil from this organized discourse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the empty room, the flames of laughter provoked resounding: "If it is to bring you closer to your Lord, better dedication?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Winchel felt inexplicably ridiculous, and had a dignified and doubtful heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame of the group became serious: "Don't you feel weird? It is also a devout believer and guard of the god of truth, pastor, bishop, monk and part Paladins can be given the magic of the gods, and most of the non-priest-born night watchers can only rely on their own blood to fight the same, most of the Paladin's magic is far weaker than the same-level priest, why? Why is the god of truth and selflessness treating its guards so unfairly?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Nonsense! We can only regain our original sin through selfless dedication. The Lord's gift!" Winchel's anger seemed a bit unreal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The flame sneered, "How much dedication you have made for the God of Truth, not to give the magic, at least to your knight's rank." Improve?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
