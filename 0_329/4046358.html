			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the church’s recent strategic center, the Holm Kingdom has gathered four legends, seven or eight golden knights, the traditional significance of the Vaughan Principality. The parish against the northern church is much stronger, so even if it is a rotation in the retreat, there are three cardinals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a night watchman knocked on the door with the prescribed number, the three cardinals looked up at the same time, but one of them rose up and looked up at the door. Going by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the intelligence inside the Magic Council?" The Cardinal had no trace of excess meat on his face. The blue eyes looked pure, but they did not see the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night watchman took out a letter and respectfully said: "Yes, Andrade."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the sealed letter, Andrade drew a cross on his chest: "The Lord will bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Only the truth is forever!" The night watchman replied solemnly and retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andrade, is it about the level of intelligence, do you need to report to the Cardinal?" another Cardinal asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrade heard the words, looking at the back of the envelope, where the secret keywords were written with secrets - after several incidents, the church has asked for spies When transmitting information, the key words of the information are simply written on the back of the envelope. If it involves the content of the doctrinal and theological theories, it is necessary to indicate that the cardinal and the cardinal can be mentally prepared before reading the information, so as not to be like As of this time, even the monk leader Valen Hill was also injured and injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Spirit, New Particles, Shake, Atomic Theory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into Andrade's deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the level of intelligence, indicating that it is the third-level important information behind the angels and angels. You can’t watch it privately. You must submit the cardinal immediately. bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrade’s dark blue eyes twitched slightly and replied with trepidation: “虔 虔 徒, the general intelligence of the Magic Council.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After reading, make a record, and so on to the bishops." Another cardinal has no doubt that Andrade will lie on this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a cardinal belief is not pious and trusts in the Magic Council, then waiting for him may only be swallowed by the Holy Light, there is no other way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation room, three desks are triangular, so Andrade sits in his own position, not worried about other cardinal peeping, like Reading ordinary information, I saw the letter in my hand, and then wrote on the reading record: "In the magical parliament, due to the contradiction between the periodicity of the elements and the atomic theory, many high-level arcans began to reflect and discuss atomism, but not yet There are valuable results. It is an intelligence that needs to track follow-up development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, information was transmitted from time to time, and the three cardinals read each part. , put them in separate categories and record the contents of the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten o'clock, a bishop specializing in distributing information knocked in and took away a few stacks of rubbish information from the top left of each cardinal desk. They will be communicated to bishops, night watchmen, pastors, and trainee pastors at different levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop with a thick stack of intelligence came to the magical room of the special rubbing document, starting to print according to the number of people of different levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large amount of intelligence, he did not read it as usual, and he planned to wait until the distribution to see his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30, a piece of information was passed to different places by different people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While relatively calm in a lot of retreats, the three cardinals exchanged "reading records" to master the information, and began to summarize them, preparing for the eleven Half-submitted to Cardinal Filibel and the referee giant Baha'u'llah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrade squinted, his eyes deep, laughing and not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Scriptures are doctrines, the truths that the gods have said, the gospels that teach the believers, and the theology is the study and doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, including The improvement of the magic, the deep interpretation of the doctrine, and the discussion of various inexplicable problems are the teaching materials for teaching the pastor. The two are not the same. The former can be full of metaphysical content, and the latter must have Detailed explanation and argumentation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Abidal is the bishop of the monastery, holding a homage to the improved theology of the pope, because he is very clear, if not Improvement, with his own talent and understanding of the doctrine, it is difficult to become a five-level bishop in his thirties, responsible for the largest monastery in the entire parish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the gift of the Lord to us, the truth that is taught by the spokesperson of the gods." Abidal has to do every day. Similar to gratitude and prayer, "Greed and weak will blind our hearts, let us forget to thank the Lord for the gift... Gratefulness is the best morality of mankind. I hope that your way is on the ground, like walking in your country..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the prayer, Abidal painted a cross on his chest, whispering: "On the truth forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open your eyes, Abidal saw that his pastor had already held a few messages at the door, and nodded that he could come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What important information is there today?" Abidal took the paper and asked casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young pastor replied with a compliment: "The bishops are all regular intelligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well." Abidal gently began to read, this is the normal world, and there may be important information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of regular intelligence, Abidal read very quickly, and it didn't take long before he saw the penultimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He usually teaches theology to be serious, the attitude is harsh, and often scares the pastor of the trainee to be uneasy, secretly calling him "the devil angel", but now, his one can Let the apprentice pastor's sudden and quiet face emerge with an unspeakable expression of horror, just like breaking into hell and discovering that he has become the most evil and horrible Duke of the Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About two thousandth..." Abidal seemed to have a hoarse and low voice from the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The holy name of the atom...the basis of theology...was it destroyed by the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The young pastor did not dare to leave after sending the information, because he had to wait for Bishop Abidal to read the information to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quietly waiting for a while, he suddenly felt the whole room became hot and dignified, and heard the inaudible voice in the mouth of Bishop Abidal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurried young pastor ignores the etiquette and honor, and looks directly at Abidal’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, he saw a shocking scene that could never be forgotten:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Abidal There was great fear, anger, and sorrow on his face, followed by a pure and holy light that erupted uncontrollably from his body, engulfing the cognac expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little ray splash, the young priest is completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the raging sun in the midday, this pure light seems to have been a little bit red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the Holm parish, there are several bishops who believe in theology and are swallowed up by the Holy Light under the violent impact - this is the church Verifying the distribution of the information, they subconsciously did not doubt the real name of the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, although more than 20 bishops have preserved their surnames, they have a strong sense of distrust of theology and doctrine, and it is difficult to promote them in the future. The bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ At noon, in the Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
