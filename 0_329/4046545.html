			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien asks: "As the particle speed and energy increase, its orbital radius will increase accordingly, and the cyclotron's Space is limited, the theoretical infinite acceleration must be affected by external conditions. If you want to break through this boundary, you can either expand the space with space-like magic hidden names, or build a cyclotron very large, with a radius of several kilometers. A dozen kilometers is the goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are vague about the problem, Lucien intends to use this reason to vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, we don't mean this." Sprint was a little anxious. "From the situation of the cyclotron in the institute, we figured out what we could theoretically achieve." Particle energy, in fact, this has a very large deviation. When it is far away from this, the particle deviates from the accelerating electric field. Obviously, there is a contradiction between the cycle and the frequency of the electric field change. This is very strange, just like An Nick said that the bypass cycle should not only be related to charge, mass, or magnetic field strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick 补充地 added: "We want to pass Adjust the frequency of the electric field change to adapt to the change of the bypass cycle, so that the particle energy can be better improved, but there is no knowledge to refer to, and can not calculate the subsequent bypass cycle, so I would like to ask the teacher, do you invent the cyclotron? Notice this phenomenon, can you tell us where the problem is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that they really found the problem, Lucien gently sighed: Ann Ke is a very cautious person. If you dare to propose it, it means that it has been repeatedly verified. It is a real phenomenon. However, when I designed the cyclotron, I was forced into the alien space and had no time to use it. Experiments, I can't think of the reasons for a while, so we will discuss this issue together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The formula for the motion in the magnetic field and the electric field should be free from errors in the starting point. It also perfectly verifies this, so when there is a problem later, what is the difference with the previous one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The speed is getting very fast." Titus interjected, she heard Annick and Sprint tangled this problem for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint thought about it: "Energy is increased, the orbital radius becomes larger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucian waved his hand: "The essence of the latter is that the speed is getting faster. Does the contrast between the different conditions before and after the experiment indicate that the formula is no longer applicable in high-speed motion or high-energy state, or other particles themselves? Conditions, such as changes in charge and quality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien has converged and surprised, decided to throw this question out, causing the Arcanists to think To lay the psychological and psychological foundation for the future submission of the special theory of relativity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, how can the speed get faster, the quality will get bigger, and the charge will increase?" Heidi laughed and said, how can speed improve the quality? The basic surname of this substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint and Annick are similar expressions, and are more inclined to convert part of the energy into electricity in the high energy state, even if the formula does not adapt to the high speed state, This joke is worth exploring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still some time from the end of the month. You will continue to study this issue. If there is no progress, submit it as a discussion of the surname. I will let Mr. Drummond agree. "Arcane" is published." Lu Xien temporarily ended this topic, one by one to ask about the research of Jerome and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the time has only passed over two months, and the two phenomena of "superconductivity" and "relativistic effect" can be found to be very powerful in the atomic research institute. Without a breakthrough in the real surname, Jerome has a deeper excavation of the X-ray's surname and use, and it can also be used as a slow curse in the case of strengthening energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After caring about the Atomic Institute, Lucien returned to Rentatt on the magic steam train and waited for the evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim, strong, blond, handsome, John During the patrol of Nexel Palace, he was frequently watched by female officials and maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John, time is up, it’s my turn to patrol, and the day after tomorrow you should be in the communication room of Nexel Palace, not to be fascinated by the beautiful girl of Holm Kingdom. I fainted and forgot about this." The rough big knight Finger came to replace John when the night fell, and Natasha will follow her to the Knights of Holm to arrange the different key points in Necker Palace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping to the side hall of Nexel Palace, John found Joel, Eliza and Avon, and led by a maid to the villas given by the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The architectural style is retro and elegant, and there is a clear distinction between Aalto." Joel looked at the house that was own, and did not leave too much. Aalto's guilt, because according to John, Her Majesty is a year in Holm, one year in Vaolirit, and she and others will be able to go home next year, and my heart is more of a joy of exoticism. And silent to each other, the complex emotions that have not been said, should he be in the Kingdom of Holm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Joel’s hobby of artists, Eliza looked around and was very satisfied with the environment: “It’s a villa that the royal family has given, much better than ours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the garden, reaching the door of the villa, the dark-haired blue-eyed maid took the bronze key and shook the key and opened the main entrance. Then the left hand skillfully pressed it on the wall. After a bang, the hall was brightly lit, the crystal was shining, and the darkness quickly faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of this moment has caused a strong shock in the hearts of Joel and Eliza, and the hall is as bright and dazzling as the daytime. Like the paradise mountain described in the Holy Scriptures, there is never a night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired maid saw their expressions, and some proudly said: "The Baron, this is the crystal electric light that Holm Kingdom can see, through the distant river The current transmitted on it keeps running, its use is very simple, just press the switch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the royal maid, representing the queen, so can not Like the ordinary person, it directly calls the magic crystal lamp, but uses the legal title "crystal lamp". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed to a row of switches next to the door and showed the last name one by one: "That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal light illuminates, the whole villa seems to reflect the stars, beautiful, radiant, seeing John, Joel, Alisa and Ai Wen are not connected, suspecting that they are still in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s unbelievable, I like this place a bit.” Ai Wen, who has been in adulthood for a while, has a young man’s unique personality, and he thinks about it. How to show off to friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid led a few people who had not yet returned to the hall, pointing to the bar near the restaurant: "The orange wall can be opened, the lower layer is used." To refrigerate wine and a variety of foods, the upper layer can freeze ice cubes, and when placed in a wine glass, it has an unusual taste and can eliminate the heat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She While talking about the magic refrigerator that made the wall look like, the small crystal light inside was illuminated, and the upper layer was frozen with ice cubes of different sizes, and some frozen cheese-like things. The lower layer was full. A bottle of wine, drinks and food: “There is also a wine cellar in the basement of the villa that can be adjusted in temperature. They are powered by electricity and can be used by ordinary people without their own will.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence, she is looking at Joel and Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it’s so cool, compared to it, hail is a country." Ai Wen is full of praise, take out a bottle of golden wine, pour Next to the wine glass, then add ice, shake it, take a sip, only the heat of the enthusiasm of the month will dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" John regained his calm and asked thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid smiled: "The inventor ordered the 'refrigerator'. This kind of item is not only very expensive, but also cannot be produced quickly. So far, except for Her Majesty and "There are only a few of the great aristocrats to enjoy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, all the knights who followed the Queen's arrival?" John pretended to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid laughed without a word, did not answer, took them to visit the villa, and introduced some novelty items from time to time, such as exhaust fans, improved fireplaces, such as The high-hanging silver-gray boxes in different positions of the villa make Joel and Eliza very surprised that they only need to press the buttons on the wall, and the boxes can blow the wind at different temperatures to create a refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There hasn’t been visited yet, the ringing of the bell is ringing, but the piercing is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid smiled more than the gesture of picking up the strip: "It should be looking for you, Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John picked up the rack in doubt The strip on the iron box, I heard the Finge’s laughter when I was not in my ear: “John, is that you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s me, Finger, what's going on?” John asked in vain, is it a communication? But how far is it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fenger is very proud of it: "This is the unique wired phone of the Holm Kingdom. It can communicate directly from a distance. It is a magical item! What happened later?" The situation will be able to inform you as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be receiving the same introduction in the briefing room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of the nobles and some of the big merchants at Renttat have this kind of phone at home, there is the address book, and you can call directly to the Baron." The maid smiled at the notebook next to the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, and Avon were all numb, and watched the maid open another oddly silvery thing on the coffee table, twisting the knob . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the sound of Zizz, the sound of this strange thing suddenly appeared:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...In the future, at the Glorious Cathedral, Her Majesty the Queen accepted the coronation of Cardinal St. Sarde..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who, who is talking? ?? Ai Wen's ability to accept is still strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is shocked: "Is there someone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid laughs "This is a radio that can accept broadcasts in different frequency bands. What you hear is the Holm news channel that belongs to the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this What the hell is it?” Joel asked with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid probably explained it, and wrote several channels that she could listen to on the paper. Finally: "The Baron, I will bring your servants and maids. Come in, if you feel unsatisfied, even if you return to the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good." When I saw so many new things, John urgently needed to sort out his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw the servant, the maid left, and the surroundings were quiet, Ai Wen was happily playing with the radio, listening to different channels, and some of the operas in the show let Joel And Alice loves it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These should be simplified magic items, is he?" John meditated, occasionally looked up, and looked at Joel and saw it. Suspicion in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Eliza whispered: "Here is the Kingdom of Holm. Do you say that Little Evans is nearby?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the neighborhood? Can we still meet with him? Her Majesty has just accepted the church’s coronation, and we have betrayed him...” Joel was bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing his words, Eliza’s eyes were red and she couldn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John silenced and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Wen, who hasn’t spurred the blood, didn’t care: “It’s all told by Evans, and the Holm Kingdom is full of magical items. The relationship between the magician and the nobility should be very close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, he is adjusting the frequency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about how other nobles do it, we are outsiders, there is no foundation, we must consider the reputation of Her Majesty." John voice was low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Ai Wen didn’t know what frequency band was tuned, and the sound inside the radio was as crisp as the Lark: “...Arcs Audit Committee member Lucien? Mr. Evans returned safely from the heterosexual space and severely condemned the pale hand. A few extremists did not repent and incited some of the necromancers who did not know the truth to spread rumors. This is a distortion of the facts, a filth against his individual and the parliament. Everyone is closely united around the Supreme Council, which is centered on the Speaker of Douglas, and cannot be influenced by rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
