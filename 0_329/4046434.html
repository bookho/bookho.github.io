			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this topic, Eric sighed deeply: "Useless, Levski, useless, you are a horn Argument, no committee accepts such whimsical things. It is totally different from the real world we see. It is completely contrary to the foundation of geometry. It is undoubtedly wrong. We have advised you for so many years of old friends. Still don't waste time on this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need for magical structure graphics and the realization of the cognitive world, mathematical research has been used throughout the history of magical exploration. Among them, the currently recognized basis of geometry is the five axioms and five public works proposed by the legendary magician of the ancient magical empire in "Geometry", known as Mencius geometry, because he is the pioneer of the tower organization. This is also known as the tower geometry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth public setting (its equivalent proposition is "a little outside the line, there is only one line parallel to the known line.") too cumbersome It is not like a publicity. It is like a theorem that needs to be proved. It has attracted the interest of many magicians. Especially after the establishment of the Magic Council, the mathematical and mathematical achievements have been remarkable. More and more magicians have joined this rank and tried to find a kind. The method to prove this publicity, but they have all failed, can not give a convincing logical derivation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Eric, Levski is one of the losers. He first assumes that "there is a straight line, at least two lines can be drawn." Knowing that the lines are parallel, and then proving the error of this hypothesis, in order to prove the correctness of the fifth publicity of the tower geometry, but the result is unexpected, with this assumption combined with the other five axioms and four public works of the gate geometry, It turned out that there was a geometric system that was logically devoid of problems but inexplicable, absurd, and contrary to the "reality", and was treated in unison by the tower towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Levsky’s unimpeded submission of the paper, it was subjected to fierce criticism and pungent sarcasm, and it was undoubtedly not approved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eric, have you read my paper carefully? Have you read the process of argumentation carefully? Is it premise that the premise and logic deduction are wrong? You Why don't you understand it?" Levsky was so excited that he was shaking. The perennial blow did not make him yield. In the past ten years, even if the magic research stopped, the strength stopped, and he was ridiculed and satirized by many ridicules. He did not give up his theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric raised his hand and pressed down: "Yes, the application of the counter-evidence and the logical derivation are not wrong, but Levsky, open you Eyes, look at our world, look at this table, this room, this magical structure, they are all different from the geometry you imagine! They are real and real, you say, which one should we believe? You I didn’t spend a lot of money printing, are I going to spread it to other Arcans? Are they approved?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No.” Levski Sui and Tang dying, he used to think that the members of the audit committee and the towers of the towers were too rigid and too conservative to "kill" their essays, so they intended to go to young magicians and mathematics who have not accepted too much intrinsic theory. The authority of the field, Douglas Speaker, Lord Hathaway, Lord Paris, and others, spread their own geometric system. What is still available is that the young Arcanists are ridiculously sneer and blow, and what kind of jokes, your propositions are simply Is contrary to conventional cognition, Straight line through the outer two parallel lines that do try! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the authority of the field of several digits, the same remains silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have perfected it." Levsky then stressed that the tone was a little weaker than the firmness of the previous one, but it quickly disappeared. "This time, I should pass, Eric, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric sympathized and sighed with a headache: "But, Lev Ski, you have submitted it several times in the past ten years, and every time it has not been approved, and the committee has stipulated that the papers should not be submitted repeatedly, so as not to waste the time of the committee members. You look at you, already in your forties , or a low-level magician, whether you have spent time studying arcane and improving your magical power, you can't do this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It is the most complete argument and explanation. Eric, please, submit the paper to the Evans committee. In the next few years, I will concentrate on the magic." Levsky looked eagerly and hopefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s face with no smile was drawn: “Levsky, Evans committee only reviews papers with subverted surnames, which will shake the magician’s recognition. Knowing the world, letting your head blast the papers, and yours is only a purely mathematical paper. Even if it violates common sense, it has nothing to do with the cognitive world. It will not have serious consequences. Therefore, according to the rules, it cannot be submitted to Evans. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Levsky continued to insist, Eric sighed again: "So, I have the words "subversion of surname" and "mathematical" on the surface of your paper, in addition to giving two digits of authority. The committee will review and send a copy to the Evans committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands that the members responsible for the review have not changed in the past few years, they have long been Levsky’s paper is abhorrent. If it is not known that the newly-entered Evans committee is responsible for reviewing the subversion of the paper, Levski may not be so determined to submit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first line of hope is at least hope! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Eric..." Levsky didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric puts his hand on his hand: "Go back and wait for the results of the review. I hope that your life will be on the right track as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levsky solemnly nodded, uneasy and full of expectations, can Evans members look at his paper fairly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15th floor of the Magic Tower, spacious and bright room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, the magical array of shining white light stretches out on both sides and distributes the papers one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mathematics? Subversion of surnames? To Mr. Nessica, Ms. Milina, Mr. Evans." The sound of metal texture paused for a while and then did Out of choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, starlight hangs, elements run, electronic surround, Lucien spread the spiritual power and fluctuated it with the stars, elements, ice and snow, and then carefully shook it, gradually adding the surname of "spiritual particles" in the instant surname of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, Lucien is very cautious, the change is extremely small, and he is worried that the mental power will be out of control, leading to the shock and destruction of the entire world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, Lucien ended the morning meditation, left the bedroom, had breakfast, and walked to the Magic Tower of Parliament at the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Lazar, how do you laugh at the mouth today?" Just entering the Atomic Research Institute, Lucien saw that he never went early. Lazar alone walked back and forth in the office, his mouth opened, with a bright but silly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Lucine, you came so early." Lazar was shocked, then smugly said: "I can fly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said as he flew up and almost hit the light blue ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I’m in the middle of the promotion, I have to invite you to celebrate." Lucien finally understood why Lazar was so excited, so he laughed and joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar swayed down and said happily: "There must be a celebration party!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then he brought a touch of gratitude: "Thank you, Lucien, these months have followed you to the most cutting-edge research in the elemental field, which made me more aware of elemental magic, especially the discovery of electronics made me The cognitive world has been solidified a lot, so that advances can be made in advance if the mathematical ability has not improved too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or else we explore the nature of the world "Lu Xien joked, and then the tone was slightly solemn. "But the improvement in mathematics, you can not ignore, the more we go, the more we rely on the tool of mathematics."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar nodded hard: "Reassured, I know very well where my problem is. Speaking of it, after joining the Atomic Research Institute, everyone's arcane level and magical strength are rapidly increasing, Annick, Spr. Lint and Katrina have told me that they are already promoted. The ability of the magician, only a period of mental accumulation and pharmacy assistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien left this time, Lazar they follow the advance The arrangement continues with experiments on the relative quality of cathode ray and low temperature materials, but there is no longer such a compact content, and it can free up time to do some research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
