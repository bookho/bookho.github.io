			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gloomy and dark castle stands on the edge of a lake floating in Heping, with a spire of a rich ancient magical empire style like a javelin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold? The steel hammer carried a bag of ore and went to the castle's warehouse. The footsteps were heavy and the action was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an underage dwarf, he is not like the elders who are wielding huge hammers like the muscles of a toy, so a bag of ore to him It is really too heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Harold has no complaints about heavy physical labor, at least he can live, at least not as a vampire master like those exquisite dwarves selected. food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "great bloodline count" Vlad? Cecil's castle, he controls hundreds of dwarven villages around him, picking "pure blood and flesh" from among them as food, and driving the remaining slaves to work in mines and castles, mining and smelting the night plateau for him. Unique Nidhamkin and rare Karamo iron and Mithril. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves start from birth, fate seems to have been doomed, either to become food, or to die early after squeezing the power of the body, the scenery of their lives is only left The part that combines in order to reproduce the offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he never left the village where he was born and the castle of Count Vlad, Harold "heard" whether it is the desolate south where he is now It is still the north of the horror reputation, the dwarves in other areas of the plateau, the living conditions are like this, and the pain continues numbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Harold looked up and looked up at the darkness of the sky above the plateau, looking up at the bright constellation, his heart slightly sad and sad:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is my life going along such a fixed track and I can’t see a trace of hope. Can we dwarf people never recover the ancient glory?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, sharp pain was uploaded from Harold’s face, and a whip of blood oozing suddenly appeared on his left face and across the dwarf’s unique The nose extends to the right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go fast, make a stay!" The vicious and fierce voice came, and the shadow of the whip echoed in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the fate of the dwarves is not only two, but also abandoning the ancestors, like the dog to please the vampire, become their blood servant, and then look at their companions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a self-proclaimed and elegant vampire manage his dirty miners and coolies, and naturally need servants to do cumbersome things, but every vampire will have a first time If you consume your own blood, the weak vampires will be decayed in advance if they develop more descendants, so even high-ranking vampires are not willing to rush to produce offspring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the vampires are very self-satisfied, and regard most of the life of other people as dirty and mean creatures. They are not very valued or like, and it is impossible to waste blood. The source transforms them into blood races. Therefore, the number of orthodox vampires is always kept in a small range. There is a large number of blood servants who have been sucked through blood without death, as if they were obedient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a blood servant, the strength is almost a formal knight, but it will never be improved again. The life is only one-tenth of the master, and you can never resist the master, or even There will be an idea of ​​resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold looked at the dwarf who was wearing a whip and wearing gorgeous clothes, and hung his eyes, not letting his hatred in his eyes be discovered by him: Yes, Wells Steward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This abominable traitor, I do not know how many people reported and killed, and obviously only a supervisor, but like to be called For the housekeeper, when the real vampire housekeeper Galata appeared, he could not wait to kneel on the ground and kiss the other's toe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red-haired dwarf Wells, because his master Vlad is quite hateful, he shails his own beard The pitted face, at this time I saw Harold's "handsome" brown beard, couldn't help but bore the heart, and gave him a whip with his right hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What are you thinking about? Dwarves don't need to think! Do you understand? I ask you to understand? Dirty bastard dwarf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood, Wells Steward." Harold holds the hands of the ore bag and bursts into the blue veins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fast roll!" Wells did not dare to delay the progress, so as not to be scolded by the housekeeper Mr. Galata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold just stepped out, Wells’s vicious and vicious voice became very charming: "Good afternoon, Mrs. Tess, Mr. Galata, please go. Here, it is full of ore powder, very messy, and the stinky dwarf will collide with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvard can imagine Wei even if he doesn't look back Mrs. bent down and looked down, as well as the tall, vampire butler Galata's meticulous style - he always wears a black formal suit, always wearing a neat bow tie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mrs. Tess is sure to be a pretty enchanting look, with long blonde hair, a slim slender figure, a green body like a lake, and her The Earl of Rade has not changed since he became a vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of Mrs. Tess, Harold was very sad and sad. She is the most beautiful female surname dwarf in the hundreds of nearby villages. She is in her own dreams. The admiration of the lover, unfortunately she was spotted by Count Vlad and became his vampire bride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plateau breeze blew, Harold buried his head, carrying the ore bag slowly, and the sound of a bird’s voice came from behind: “Intensify Smelting ore, don't let them be lazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attention to the investigation, some sneak dwarves formed a rebel army and could not let them destroy the mine."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............has been busy until the constellation position changes, the evening is no different from before, Harold only ended the heavy labor, got a chance to breathe, and then took the next The rations - two black breads left the castle and returned to the home in a nearby village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, Harold suddenly looked around with vigilance and saw no one nearby, his expression immediately became excited and turned into a remote road, back The darkness, the starlight, and the fast pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten minutes, through a few sparse black "Wind Yang" forest, Harold saw an ordinary boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around again, then carefully and crept to the back of the boulder and tapped the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam is supreme." The weird dwarf word is pronounced from his mouth, like a spell without any mental effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound just disappeared, and the crevice suddenly cracked into the gap, as if opening a door, a gray-faced dwarf sticking his head out and looking around, then waved: "Come in, Harold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold drilled agilely, watching the dwarf close the stone door and lock it, throwing a black Bread to him: "Uncle Warren, I will go down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead, the elder is waiting for you, my child." Warren Picking up the black bread, it was clear water, and the mouth was very good to bite, as if hungry for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold understands that Uncle Warren, the dwarfs who are hiding in the ground, have long been lacking in food, so this is the case, so he sorrows and shakes his head inexplicably. The passage went deep into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was drinking the fresh water he was carrying, eating brown bread, and feeling the grandeur of the underground palace built by his ancestors, which made people deeply shocked:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are such great ancestors defeated by vampires?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be rejected by the gods? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many murals carved on the stone bricks on both sides, with overwhelming airships, steamships sailing on the ocean, and terrorist cannons bombarded with dragons. Mercedes-Benz steam train on the plains... Although Harold has seen these murals many times, he can't help himself every time he watches, so he loves to listen to the great elder Augustus. The broken intestine tells the story of the steam age. It seems that just thinking about the brilliant civilization of the ancestors, life is full of hope and inherits glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harold, are you here?" A dwarf with a long white beard looked at Harold's slightly jaw, then looked down at him and sighed softly: "It's a pity that our civilization has lost. Complex steam engines, cannons, and rifles can't be built at all, only to create sharper swords and axes. But this can only deal with blood servants, there is no way to take a vampire, let alone the north where the terrorist vampire is."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His tone is vicissitudes and desolate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder..." How do the "high-rises" who are dressed in simple but faintly higher than other dwarves stop, how can they create despair inside the Rebels? atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elder Augustus smiled calmly and calmly: "Mirna, Quikins... We must let the people who follow us understand our situation, This is a path that does not see a little hope. It is numb to live, or to defend the glory of the ancestors with blood, to die like a real dwarf, and to make their own choices."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam is supreme!" The small house on both sides suddenly screamed, "All the time is destined to die in pain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share Food, Augustus asked Harold about the recent movements of the castle. They chose the site of Count Vlad to hide. It was said that he was traumatized by "magic magic" in a war in his early years and has not fully recovered. He needs I often sleep to keep myself from decaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Mrs. Tess is telling the blood servant to look for you..." Harold only noticed a little bit of information he knew, and looked at it with hope. Gustus: "The elders, can you tell me about the ancient steam civilization?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pretty young female dwarf mirna is still young Full of expectations, listening to the story of the elders telling the past is a rare "light" in the difficult life of the rebel army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...We dwarfs once ruled the vast land, in the endless ocean, on the banks of the Negening River, in countless bustling places, we built The mega city... A chimney made of steel is like a forest, spewing black smoke, sometimes even obscuring the sun, making the day dark..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...There are huge steam trains running between cities, it takes only a few hours from here to the north... every dwarf can get enough food and use various mechanical products, such as A steam lift that people lift to the top of the building, such as a steam boiler that always has hot water for you to take a shower..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the great dwarf warriors carry The high-pressure steam bag, equipped with a robotic arm, carrying a steam rifle, opened up a dangerous field... The steam engine sailed above the ocean, and the huge barrel allowed the enemy to surrender..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know much about what is called daylight, what is sunshine, but not Harold hinder, honey Erna and the other dwarves with rapt attention, that is their dream of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with mural paintings, the city of steam machinery is so vividly floating in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold clenched his fist and vowed that one day he would rebuild such a dwarf city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of these, Augustus’s expression was full of pride and yearning, and the folds of petals on his face seemed to be full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, let's talk about it today, we will sacrifice the god of steam to the time, and the great life and death will dominate." Augustus got up and walked. To the center of the main hall, there is an altar with strange patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great elders, really useful?" asked the girl with linen hair, Mirna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus took a look at her and said sternly: "When we discovered this ruin, did we find a ritual for the ancestors to worship the gods? They are like that. Powerful, so clever, how can we do things that are useless? I think our civilization is destroyed, it must be because the god of steam is slowed down and abandoned by Him, so we need to be more religious in order to regain His care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, great elders." In this desperate situation, any chance can make the dwarves ignite the torch of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, including Harold, all the dwarves gathered in front of the altar, followed the elders with strange gestures and movements, jumping inexplicably dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
