			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, a little quiet and peaceful light emerged, just like the lake in the night reflecting the silver moon, under the breeze blowing, gently smashing the fine Wave light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment of light converges in the hands of Lucien, condensing into a sparkling scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a glimpse of Douglas, Maldi Moss, and so on. Can Lucien use the spell to use the legendary magic "time and space scepter"? Is it the same as Viking when it hit the "real god"? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they will understand when they turn around. Since Lucien has initially explored the essence of magic, there is no difference to him without using a spell. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "time and space scepter" in Lucien's hand is a little lighter, and the vast area in front suddenly falls into an extremely slow state, almost close to the effect of advanced time stop. Even the other "God Drop" in the hands of Viken, the milky white light is "frozen" there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown as the "God of Truth", the only one who has mastered the mystery of time and space, the body is a little bright, indifferent and cold, like the legend The "light of time" light helped Vicken to work hard to get rid of this sluggish state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Maldives in the distance saw Lucien’s “time and space scepter” condensed, his expression became dignified because he found that he could “immune” "The effect of stopping the effect seems to have no way to completely offset this "slowness". This state does not seem to directly affect the subject, but changes the surrounding environment in a peculiar way. Naturally, there is no way to "immune". ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real genius of Lucien's advanced class? Like Douglas's "Fate Meteor"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas frowned slightly, and he found that the "time and space scepter" change of Wicken's surroundings was not simply "slow." Rather, it is close to a state of the godlike that belongs to the world and does not belong to the world, and also like the state of "cognitive world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's majestic power of God, quickly get rid of the influence of Lucien's "time and space scepter", at this time, Lucien emerged behind The vast starry sky, the high angle of view, the huge fireball and the azure planet disappeared, showing a darkness that could not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, the horrible to unimaginable energy surged and quickly recovered. The tide rises and falls. It is the undulating energy of the sea. For another universe, this is an unobservable change in a very short time, which can be seen from here, due to inconsistencies in time and flow rates. For the class gods. Reluctantly can sense this ups and downs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror energy that rushed out was tilted out. Directly rushed to the "slow world" around Wicken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has become a channel for communicating with another universe in the cognitive world! And because of its "slow", "borrowing" comes the energy ups and downs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy surges, as if born out of thin air. In a moment, Wicken will be drowned with a ray of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One particle appears in pairs and disappears in pairs, the "slow world" is quickly "released", and the center after the "energy tide" plunders A group of bright and dark entangled "liquid" twists and becomes bigger, and it has become a Viken again, but it seems to be a lot bleak, and the breath is much weaker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this heavy blow, Viken finally recovered from the madness brought by the negative emotions and the impact of the sacred beliefs, sobered a lot, and gnashed his teeth: My 'God Drop' can't hit you, it doesn't mean you can't beat others, I don't believe you will watch them die, but don't block them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucien laughed and said: "Let's look around and talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken is spread by the "energy tide" oppression, only to feel I was in the air, and the lower part was the holy city of Lance. As for what Allinge, Rantart and the surrounding legendary powerhouses, they disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a high-dimensional state. The distance in low-dimensionality may be very close to it, but if you hit the true god and fail, the 'the boundary between God and man' is broken, this 'magic field' naturally begins. Slowly disappearing, and the first time you used 'God Drop' on me, it speeded up this pace and let it disappear quickly. Now, you can only affect the vicinity of the holy city of Reims, and can only attack just in the 'magic field' We are in the middle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien smiled and said that Douglas, "Silver Moon" and "Lord of Hell" on the other side gathered together to bring Fernando and Hathaway and others blocked it, although they could not compete with the "God of God" gods, but the three could still win a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication between the two is purely a "spiritual fluctuation" exchange, a series of words only a short moment, Viken body trembled again and again condensed "God "," and the parallel universe projection behind Lucien once again began to transform the perspective! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first time Viken attacked Lucien with the gods However, when they failed to hit the legendary strongmen of the "magic field", the magicians, nobles and ordinary people on the ground watched their shadows fade, and quickly disappeared into the sky, full of clear blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is their subconscious question, but soon, a bit The wisdom of knowledge has come to mind, and the impact of Viken is over, and the vision that the whole world can see and arrive will naturally end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the final result is..." Heidi looked at the blue sky with a slight concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint snorted: "Vicken has strength, no level, no teacher, how to lose is to lose, we still don't think This question is over, and I will recall the formulas and models that the teacher just listed and study it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is the most important!" Annick He shuddered and returned from his loss, agreeing loudly with Sprint's suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi thought for a moment and said very seriously: "Also, the teacher is so embarrassed, wrong, the teacher is so intelligent, the arcane master has a level And with the corresponding power, it will only make Viken desperately go to the end, there will be no hope, we still study the arcane system just now, it is more meaningful to study the essence of magic and soul."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Arctic Institute's Arcanists gathered together, trying to recall and write the formula given by Lucien, and work hard to conduct research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene happens in every corner of Allinge, full of hard work and hard work, the soul that is stimulated is in urgent need of such an atmosphere! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Vicken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, anyway, will be killed by Lord Evans, without bothering to think about Him, learning and research is more important! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, who was in midair, noticed this situation and laughed at the side of the "ice witch" Helen: "I have seen many plays and operas." Wicken is probably the first major villain to be forgotten before the end of the war, the first major villain so grievous and desperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helen’s eyes were slightly out of touch, and they turned a deaf ear to Natasha’s words, whispering to himself: “Cheat your... lie to you...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked up at the sky silently, and sure enough, she even forgot Viken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, she is talking and laughing here, instead of rushing to help her husband near the holy city of Reims, it is very good to explain her to this end The attitude of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sacred prayers, the boundless white light broke out and rushed toward Lucien, and Viken did not see this "Godfall". As a result, he turned directly away from the influence range of "God Drop" and "tearing" the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
