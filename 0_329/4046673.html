			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below the gray curtain is a slowly burning pale flame, like a must-have fireplace in a manor house. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the face of the soul fireplace actually shows Lucien? The appearance of Evans and Xia Feng, and harmoniously combined in everything, is like superimposing each other, and seems to be entangled, and then with their own gaze, sometimes separate, sometimes merge, sometimes revealing that they have never seen in the mirror Unfamiliar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning of the soul fireplace for the first time, Lucien once thought about it, perhaps because he was coming through, so he would not see himself in the soul fireplace. The "soul projection", so there is one more card than others, but now it seems that the secret of the soul fireplace is deeper than I thought, and I am still amazed, not only will Lucien? The soul of Evans is projected here, and the appearance of the summer wind is also revealed. The summer wind from the earth does not belong to the summer wind of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the soul fireplace still 'pipe' the soul of the earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is I have the fate of the main star of destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait to unravel this secret, maybe you can understand what I will cross, why is it just passing through Lucien Evans's body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless thoughts in my mind, and Lucien faintly grasps what the soul might be able to explain from that angle, but he There is no time to study the soul fireplace carefully, and more phenomena and experimental results are needed to prove it. At this time, the Lord of Hell is outside and will be chased, so he only has time to reach out and touch the soul fireplace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly cold is the ubiquitous feeling of the dead world. Lucien’s touch, except for the cold, has no feeling, just like there is no one there. Things, just as it is actually in other worlds, just a illusory projection stands here, and it can't be touched, inaccessible, and completely detached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the touch, Lucien’s right eye is red, crystal clear, pure dream:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Revenge gaze!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red light shines under the brace of "Uncertain Hands", from Lucien's right eye, at a real speed of light Mardi Moss, the "Lord of Hell" in the cage of "gravitational fall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not take the opportunity to give him a try, try luck, Lucien is always reluctant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the mantra was read, Lucien went back to the depths of the hall where the soul fireplace was located, and there were two in the mental field. There is no black, no white, only a gray one, a little strange and secretive and a sense of danger, and a faint vain ripple, as if there is something familiar with Lucien. Give him a strange feeling. In addition, it has a more dangerous and horrible atmosphere than the other, like a monster sleeping there that can destroy the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Familiar? The mysterious existence of the dead spirit in the dead place?" Lucien first thought of the existence of the sad reminder, and finally recovered, but was in hell The Lord and the God of the Silver Moon calculated separately and fell to sleep again. "This sense of familiarity is not in line with the impression He has left me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; It is too late to distinguish the difference between the two familiarities. Lucien subconsciously chose the gray road, and the other light is not the one that can bear it. It is the Lord of Hell and the Silver Moon. God does not dare to go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure red light hits the "Hell Lord" Maldives at the standard speed of light, and slams through his "Holy Blessed" sacred barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally couldn’t help but shun the speed of terror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "revenge gaze" that can't be played with the "unsure hand" effect only disappears after wearing a layer of defense, causing no harm to the Lord of Hell. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of his mouth was lifted again, and with a unique scornful smile, Lucian’s back disappeared behind the soul fireplace, and he shook his head leisurely, not angry at his escape, but whispered to himself:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange, this ray-like magic seems to hide something weird, something that makes me feel inexplicable, oh, 'Destiny Secrets', Lucien Evans can always make wonderful things..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, He clasped his hands like a slanted cross on his chest, and his figure suddenly changed. Obscured and lost track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just stepped into the gray martyrdom, and outside the undead natural disaster, he screamed in anger, as if he had done something that caused public outrage, but only Most of the undead did not dare to approach the soul fireplace. Only a dragon servant with a black cloak and a long scythe and a dragon sorcer with a rotten pus sullenly followed the chasing, crossed the soul fireplace and entered the ash. a martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the anger is coming from all directions, and a few legendary undead creatures seem to be inductive When I arrived at Lucien, I was approaching crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the two "Saints" teamed up to deal with the storm dominated the "Lich King" head of the crystal gem suddenly lit up, the mouth irritated low, the whole person directly Disappeared, out of the battle group, straightforward to the soul of the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Aleksey" and "Ullil" saw each other, and they also used their magic to decisively escape, not giving Fernando a chance to counterattack, no more The "Lich King" with a lot of magical magic, the two of them will be completely suppressed by the "storm master", and the calculation time, the "Ivan" gods also almost enter a long buffer - the deeper The speed of the time is faster, so although Lucien did not spend too much time to escape to the soul fireplace, the time outside has passed for a long time, and the extraordinary power of the "God of the Gods" to force the strength is naturally unsustainable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storm dominates" Fernando did not chase them, but took out the magic crystal ball, divination with the strength of the legendary peak, looking for the whereabouts of other people, this time To explore, not to destroy the foundation of the northern church, the safety of Lucien, Klaus, Erica and others is more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball became dark, and the four-pointed star appeared in it. After a flash, it was covered with gray mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only four fate stars...Klaus is falling?" Fernando couldn’t control his temper and roar, full of anger, thunder and lightning. The storm plundered and turned the palace into a ruin. "Lu Sien seems to have entered the soul fireplace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only there will be his own astrology Completely lost the effect, let Lucine's fate of the main star in the ashes of the fog like solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another towering palace, the "Ivan" effect that is about to disappear in the "God" effect is slightly changed, as if it is also aware of changes in the soul fireplace. With the retreat of Alexei and Ullil, they seized the opportunity to suppress Douglas, and a pair of wings of the gods of Ming and Qing dynasty fanned into countless spots of light and disappeared into the same place, while giving "Felix" not far away, The Angel of Light passed the message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Vicente and Elika caught the attack and saw their enemies fleeing. Since the battle, the two legendary magicians have fallen to the disadvantage, especially Ellie. The card has already shown signs of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the soul fireplace confluence." They received Douglas, Fernando's electromagnetic communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because several sagacious legends are rushing to the soul fireplace, they have not stopped, and after a while they are passed through a series of souls to the soul fireplace. I saw Douglas in a black tuxedo and saw the unstable mood. The storm screamed Fernando. I saw a lot of dying souls in the square in front of the soul fireplace. There are many legendary undead creatures, and they are making intimidating roars, but they are not Dare too close to the soul fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Klaus fell, and died under the light of the trial, specifically do not know who is moving." Douglas said that he combined with the scene to predict As a result, it is quite close to the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Is Klaus fallen?" Elika reluctantly asked, with a thick rabbit dead sorrow, although she and Crow The relationship between Sri Lanka is not too good, but as a companion to adventure, his fall may represent his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alex and Ullil are besieging me." Fernando's voice seemed to suppress volcanic anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika shocked and said: "The one who fights me is the angel of light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Who is it? Are there other powerful legendary gods in the Temple of the Dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick doubts rose in their hearts, leaving them with no thoughts to study the soul fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary undeads are slowly coming forward, seemingly restraining fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas returned, and his right hand pressed down: "Can't delay, remember the feeling of the soul fireplace, go back and study it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando shook his head, red eyes rounded up: "You go back first, I am going to find Lucien, as the legendary peak, as long as I don't go deeper, I can definitely take him. Return safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can't escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika opened his mouth, but couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas silenced and pulled his bow tie: "I went to Feriendo to find Lucien, so that the big danger can escape, you take the opportunity." Leaving the Temple of the Necromancer, bringing back the initial exploration of the soul fireplace and the secrets of the Northern Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of the Speaker..." Elika does not know that she is I want to stop, or I want to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is determined and decisive: "Don't be jealous, act!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente's gaze Already moved to the soul fireplace, the skinny face is uncontrollable fanaticism, rare to show the expression of non-dead, Erica also shifted the focus, paying attention to the feeling of the soul fireplace and the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many legendary deaths led the undead natural disasters closer and closer, hiding the intelligent centaur shooter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the number of legendary and deadly Legion, and feeling the strong pressure, Douglas sighed softly: "Go to sleep." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flew up and pressed his hands:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blaze!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, the place where the locked centaur shooter is located raises a bright sun, and the surrounding undead reaction does not vanish, as if it melted into the air. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing yang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing sun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of sun rises, unimaginable energy storms roar in tens of kilometers of wide squares, even on the edge of the explosion, Fernando, Vicente and Elika I have to give myself a few more defenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of stern screams just came to an abrupt end, and these undead undeads have no way to resist the "eternal blaze", and their spirits Wisdom makes them too late to escape, instinctively flocking to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Temple of the Dead, lost the solid black and white gray, only the eye-catching light illuminates everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it calms down, the square has become a deep pit, and the undead that had not been counted before has disappeared, and the roars have all disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is quiet..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elika sighs with Vicente Seize the opportunity to send away from the Temple of the Necromancer, which cannot directly jump into its own plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
