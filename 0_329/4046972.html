			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black curtain collapses, the sky is translucent, and the ripples seem to come from ancient times, spanning a long time, washing all the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of time, everything is dust! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this wave of light, a figure is like a fish, slipping through the ice wall cast by the aurora, and rushing back in the "fog of the soul" Before, I came out with a lot of encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of time is pervasive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is much more bleak than just now, and there is no such thing as a temperament, a feeling of pride, just detached from the absolute darkness, and rushed into The light of a road opened up the time and space barrier and sent away to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a black, huge sickle, with the deepest and deepest death, suddenly descended from the sky, seems to have been waiting for this opportunity, This place is in the center of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams of sternness are like coming from the future, and everyone’s heart is screaming, making people shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time" splits from it and breaks into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the "it" did not care, directly jumped into the tears of the "space gap", the latter half suddenly blasted, let the death giant In the viscous "time sea", it becomes very slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the dragon erupted, a pale flame followed the light and shadow into the gap, and then the gap closed, and "time and space" returned to normal. It’s just a vague, painful, sorrowful resounding resounding at high altitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not dead?" Near the agreed meeting place, Plyhill felt that his mouth was not close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of flight. She has also been paying attention to the battle of the legendary powerhouses, to understand how powerful force is in killing Ketonia - a legendary third-order magician, two legendary first-class magicians, equivalent to legend One of the second-order undead creatures, equivalent to two legendary first-order undead creatures, was replaced by the saint in the Rendez Glorious Cathedral. It was also the fallen ending, but the "heart of time" Ktoney Ya actually escaped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he was seriously injured, he could escape from such a siege, enough to make him proud! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is around. Congos was trapped in the eye socket. The two-pointed red-winged beak is extremely fierce: "The power of time is so strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He attributed the reason to the highest position in magic. "Time and space power", you must know that the former pope "killed" "death lord" Tananos, did not use "God Drop". At that time, no one knew that the Church of Truth had such a horror that seemed to surpass the genie. Until "Taiwan Time Dragon" Aphora and its companion "Taiwan Time Dragon" Danisos was invited by the Archer of the Wizard of Magic, "The Light of Stars." Assaulting Lance, the world’s talents have seen this “power of God” that transcends everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is even at the peak of the three magical empire. It was only the retreat to the dark mountains. The "Taiwan Time Dragon" Aphroda, who had never bowed, was completely degraded. Danisos was seriously injured and injured by the aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case of the power of the "God Drop", but it also confirms the power of time and space, forcing the former pope to use " God descends." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the former pope and the current pope each used a "God Drop", the opponents are "the god of the sun church" and the hills The empire of the magical empire "the light of the glory", both of which belong to the strongest in the field of space and time, especially the latter, with the "Antilever Lock" that has been well-established for tens of thousands of years, is considered to be the most promising The person who blocks the "God Drop", but under the attack, the people are destroyed, and every powerful person who lives is on the side, so that all the magicians begin to fear from the bottom of their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanata looked at the gaps in the air and the gaps in the sky, and the body that blended into the shadows was highlighted, and it could no longer be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the horror, they also showed a deep disappointment. I thought that the nightmare of the great Holm area magician in Ketonia will end today, but his combat power is beyond imagination! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, who is not far from the meeting place, looked at the sky with a slight stun, and it was a bit unacceptable, although he had the psychological preparation to escape from the death of Ketonia, but true When you witness it, it is inevitable that it is not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is even more stunned: "He actually ran away? Who led the study of the legendary blood of the blood?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is deeply impressed by the legendary lord, and can actually study the blood of this cheating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that the "Disaster King", Lord Wicken, in the legendary magician who studies the blood of the three empires, he can definitely rank in the top three, of course, It is rumored that he is not very good at the power of time. He is working with the "Prophet", Mr. Muskilllin. However, the results of this time-like blood are not outstanding, and they have not shown the strength worthy of attention until the gram. Tonia's blood variability makes people understand the value of time-like blood..."Annold explained Fernando's doubts, his expressions remained calm and calm, and there was no surprise because of the death of Ketonia.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be 'Disaster King' Vicken and 'Prophet' Muskilllin..." Fernando repeated it, and he still had the title of "Lord" in the future, and he looked suspiciously. Nord: "Old fox, you don't seem nervous or disappointed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very disappointed and nervous." Anord replied with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't see it." Fernando stared at Annold and said: "Actually, is it intentional to let him go? Or something happened in the dark before." Other things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, how do I know? I am not there anymore." Anord has a look like "I am innocent, don't yell at me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded thoughtfully: "No matter what, Ketonia is also a member of the nobility. Killing him directly will cause panic and rebound of the nobility." It’s not as good as...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey.” Annold laughed and said nothing, pointing to the Puli Hill Road at the entrance to the cave in the distance. I talked to them in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Plyhill also saw Anord, and suddenly, a fiery fireball appeared around her. Surrounded by flying, then, "Xie charm" smiled: "Old fox, come over and explain what is going on, I promise not to hit you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This distance I can already communicate well.” Anord touched his white beard and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You owe us an explanation." Congers flew over, and because of the bones alone, it was hard to guess his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord converges with a smile, and reinterprets the previous explanations of Douglas and Fernando very seriously and sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, how many legendary lords are interested in working together? To what extent?" Plyhill, as the leader of an organization, has been deceived at this time. Recovered in the sorrow of being blinded, seriously thinking about the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annud looked at them and said: "This has to be negotiated by everyone, and it depends on the church's response, but at least the most preliminary cooperation is not a problem. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a nine-level bishop is killed, the church will definitely strengthen the hunt, and the two cardinals and several epic knights will move. We have to avoid this time for the time being." Nelson's first tone and attitude have been quite good since attending the Aringe party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the "Death Lord" is willing to stand up and participate in cooperation, temporarily forget the previous "unpleasant", it seems that there is no need to be too "resentment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just finished, surrounded by a faint and hot darkness, a Necromancer with a long black sickle floating on his head, he All of them were wrapped in dark robes, only two red light in the shadow of the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
