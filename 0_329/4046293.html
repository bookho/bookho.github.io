			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy dressed up by the clown? What did he ask?" Lucien frowned, his voice full of doubts, this is a reaction from the heart. Non-actor self-cultivation, when did you have a relationship with a clown? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am in contact with Grace at Sea Pearl Stuart to get in touch with Granny. Is anyone beginning to doubt the identity of his magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greece smiled and shook his head: "I don't know who he is, maybe he dressed as a clown just to cover up his original appearance. His temperament Evil, even if it is just asking ordinary things, it makes me cold and sweaty, my emotions are almost collapsed, and it is difficult to generate rebellious thoughts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He mainly I asked how I met your teacher in Stourke, how did you get your favor, let you write to Christopher Master and Mr. Victor to introduce me, yes, he also asked you around you. Is there anyone else who has a connection with someone who is very different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I was suppressed by the clown's momentum, it seems that I am slightly concealed or afraid to answer, He will actually kill me, so I have to tell the story again, how do I pretend to be your student in Stourke, how to meet the teacher in the 'Shark' restaurant, and how you are exposed The thing of the fake student, the whole body trembled, the hands and feet were soft, and I had to use The difficulty of living was used as an excuse. I also said that we met in another restaurant the next day, and received your inner counsel and warnings, let me completely repent, give up vanity and shallowness, and come to Aalto to study music." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that it’s not good for strangers to talk about these things, but at the time I really couldn’t control myself, please ask the teacher to forgive me." Grace Apologize apologetically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened carefully, nowhere invisible: "It’s not for me to tell these things to strangers, it’s mainly because you used to fake me. The experience of students deceiving the public is easily attacked by others. Since no one has taken this matter to accuse you for so long, and your piano playing has now been unanimously affirmed, it is only exposed as a A beautiful talk. Oh, you will be the one who regained the Lord's favor after confession, and I will be rumored to be a broad-minded, compassionate, and noble musician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"噗哧..." A little uneasy Grace couldn’t help but laugh after hearing the last sentence of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she smiled and said: "In fact, I still have the last sense of reason to control myself, so I hide the key point in front of the clown. That is the teacher, let me Helping to pass the note to Granny, this is the main reason why you forgive me and give me the opportunity to repent, not what I told him, you are the pity of my family, and the limbs of one night. Entangled..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I deliberately added a bit of lust, or else the clown is so dark and hard to believe that there will be holy mercy like an angel. The existence of the person, with the physical exchange, the temptation of beauty, but more convinced him." During the speech, she looked at Lucian, seemingly watching his reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is serious and solemn: "In fact, you have nothing to say directly. I just contacted a friend I met with Mr. Granny to discuss. Business matters, after the end, are not impossible to say to others. Your excuses with beauty will actually ruin my reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the Viscount As long as the identity of Granny is not exposed, even if the source is told locally, it has no effect on himself. At that time, she was kept secret, mainly for Granov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Teacher Evans, my own mental darkness, I feel that you let me hide at the time is not wanting to let others know, this is trying to make up for it." Silke apologized in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reveals a sly expression: "Well, Grace, don't have to blame myself, I can understand your maintenance, don't do it anymore." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher you are really a broad-minded, kind-hearted, noble-minded musician." Seeing Lucien without accusation, Grace relaxed. Humor and cleverly borrowed Lucien’s own words, “Well, I have to go back to the living room, or they will really think we have something...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Greece to leave the corridor where the toilet is located, Lu Xien has a "mild and calm" sign of the surname smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a girl relies on wit, temperance and determination to conceal the key content in a question that is likely to be a knight-level powerhouse. Lucien does not believe it, especially that she is not her relative, not the most important thing in her heart. The person who is overwhelmed by the momentum and controlled by the spirit, she is unlikely to be awake because of the extreme resistance in the subconscious. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to believe that you only met a few times, and Grace deeply fell in love with himself and beyond her life because of worship and gratitude? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be kidding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the bathroom, Lucien seems to be familiar with things without any influence, but he is guessing the identity of the clown: "The night watchman The investigator of the pale hand? The remnant of the Silver White Corner? The intelligence personnel of the Principality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did they suddenly investigate themselves? And it was Grace. I went to Aalto to investigate? Well, from this point, the investigators of the pale hand can be ruled out..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The intelligence department of the Principality has been cleaned and In Natasha's control, she knows where I am going and things, there is no need to ask Grace, and there is no need to send someone to investigate musician Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two things that are definitely not good. Most of them think that I have a lot of relationship with the magician and the professor. When did they have doubts? The death feast should only be limited to the Necromancer. Internal and Viscount Kareldia know..."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recalled a little bit of analysis: "But they should only be suspicious, there is no definite evidence, otherwise the night watchman will come directly to the door, and the silver horn will retaliate without any scruples and Advocate going out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wipe your hands with a paper towel next to them, and Lucien temporarily pressed down many ideas and returned to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Delicious and enjoyable lunch time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, have you had any other creations in addition to the two piano sonatas "Moonlight" and "Storm" in the past few years? I think so much The folk music has definitely given you a lot of inspiration.” Victor swallowed the mignon, sipped a glass of wine and smiled and asked, “I think everyone is as curious and looking forward to me.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it was in the words that echoed him, Joel, Felice, Eliza and others all looked at Lucien, only Ai Wen was very restrained to keep Dining etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there are two symphonic works, one is nearing completion, and then only need to adjust and practice more according to the performance of the band. But it is The inspiration from folk music is more freely structured than ever, and may be criticized fiercely." Lucian answered the question of the clown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunchtime, Felice and Lucien re-familiarized, and then smiled curiously: "Rossien in your many titles But with the name of 'changer', bold changes, new directions, and more free structures are not the expectations we should have at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared with three years ago, the nobles in her body are much less proud and speak a lot more humorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, little Evans, I can't wait now. I and you, Eliza, grew up in the southern part of the Vaolire Principality, doing a tour. The place where the poet had been there was also limited. Later, when Aalto arrived, he never left, so it is difficult to have access to unique music that is not so famous in other places. It can only be indirectly understood by the bards." Talking about music Joel is happy from the heart, and the eyebrows are full of excitement and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena, as an ordinary musician, still maintains the politeness and courtesy of the past in front of Victor and Felice, after many people have talked about it. Sweetly laughed and said: "Lu Xien, what about your other work? If it is finished, will you hold a 'return concert'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien, the top famous musician, just wants to think that the Hall of the Holy Land is always free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the people once again concentrated on the face of Lucien, even Evan couldn’t help but look at it curiously, but this can show off to the partners. thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
