			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magician Union has unearthed the city of the sky, "Aringe", which has been cleaned up in the central area and built many magic towers or houses. If the rest of the remaining buildings still have research value, Douglas’s first sights will never be so ruined. Now, near the remains of the core magic tower, a low-pitched magic tower sounds a melodious bell, according to the agreement. This is a sign of the beginning of the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent quarreling magicians on the square closed their mouths, and it was a pity that the rare venting opportunity ended, slowly "surgeing" toward that Five-story magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old man seems to have exchanged opinions in private..." Fernando snorted, and the real agreement was often reached before the meeting, and the meeting was only announced. occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas silently watched the magicians coming from all directions, his eyes deep, not knowing what to think, until the square became deserted, he sighed: "Let's go in too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also feel helpless about their quarrels? At this moment of crisis and despair, they are still not willing to let go of prejudice and Selfish, sincere cooperation, to be honest, I saw no confidence in the future of these magical organizations.” Fernando complained about moving forward and felt that he had grasped Douglas’ current mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head and his voice was low: "Everyone is selfish, they have, President Annord, Vice President Rigg has Roland, you have, I also have, so sincere cooperation is definitely not a luxury that everyone should completely eliminate selfishness, but to show strength. Let everyone understand that fighting with you will have a bright future that will satisfy their own interests and wishes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not the kind of strength in the true sense, including but not limited to, it has more rich connotations, for example, even if we are now real strength Not strong enough, but as long as there is a way for everyone to trust us, we feel that the road we lead them is full of hope, and it is possible to lead them all the way down, that is the same as the 'strength' category."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His expression is solemn. There is no despair and resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is not the process of building confidence in us through various methods? In the illusion system. This is a very deep content, the more 'skill' the more 'trust' 'The person, the better the effect." Fernando habitually disparaged the words of Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas puts up a serious expression and looks at Fernando: "Do you know the illusion system?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He is not personally good at the theory of illusion. Maybe you can use a lot of illusions. But there is no more in-depth research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My teacher is a scholar. Before I was killed, I kept a letter with many of the illusionist and **, so I also know a lot of illusions. The magician of the department." Fernando mentioned his own teacher and seemed to have no deep feelings for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas did not continue to ask. Because the two men have already reached the front of the magic tower, a middle-aged man wearing the "mystery badge" of the magician union is waiting for the door, eagerly said: "Is it Douglas president? The president will let you enter the hall. After that, go to the living room on the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is Douglas recognized by Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Douglas answered politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes middle-aged men a little surprised, because the sorcerers in his impressions are very arrogant, even if they are not showing off, I can clearly feel that even if I am amiable as President Anord, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the hall, there has been a stone bench, Douglas and Fernando At the periphery, stepped into the living room on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas, come, I will introduce you to you." Annord smiled and greeted him, a look of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is calm and watery, Fernando whispered whispered, watching the old fox look happy, the negotiations seem to be very smooth, the initial cooperation intention should have been reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord leaned close to Douglas's shoulder and pointed to a bloated and obese old man: "Nelson, the leader of the 'red eye', the sorcerer, don't look at him so fat, the ability of ** is no less than ordinary The Golden Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that Douglas instantly understood what Nielsen is good at, he is undoubtedly good at blood fusion and transformation, maybe he Every part of the body has solidified a certain ability to exert unexpected effects in battle. The current appearance is just a disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being impressive, Nielsen’s crystal-clear ruby ​​eyes are striking because of their contrast with the appearance of obesity. The meat smiled and smiled: "I have always been looking forward to Antwerp, and the sergeant from it is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is talking about yearning, tone But there is no such thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Douglas, who understands the temptations of the two empires, nodded and smiled, not minding Nielsen’s attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord pretending not to hear Nielsen’s words, continue to smile and introduce: "Amanata, the 'Lord of Shadow' student, currently 'shadow One of the two singers of the singer's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amanata is covered in a black magical robe, sitting in a shadow corner inconspicuously. After hearing Anord's introduction, he only slightly nodded, and he said hello. If it was not a standard masculine name, Douglas could not even see whether he was a man or a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord smiled and teased: "The shadow singers are all in love with the shadows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not far from the side of Amanta, there is a cold and gloomy magician wearing a black ornate robes painted with dark gold patterns, with only a white skull on his head and a needle-like dark red in his eyes. The flame is a typical lich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congus, who created the "Soul High" master, once praised by the "Lord of Shadows", said that he is very hopeful to become a legendary magic Teacher.” Anord introduced the lich who is obviously not weaker than Nielsen and Amanata. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congus opened his mouth and his voice was hoarse. It seems as if someone is grinding a long sword with rust: "I have never heard from the friends of Antiphler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be with Antiller The relationship is shallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Antwerp is much stronger than my mighty magician." Douglas replied modestly, and he thought so in his heart, "And I am a weirdo." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, but Antiphler was destroyed by the Pope." Nelson sharply interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers looked at him and said coldly: "At least the empire is not dead, Arthur..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough and cough, Annod interrupted the upcoming quarrel with a cough, introducing the boring lady with dark red hair: "Beautiful Ms. Plyhill, Tower of the Destroyer The master of the master, the elemental master of the 'big cracking'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿.Anord. Do you want me to give you a visit?" Plyhill laughed at Anord with a smile and then extended his white and slender right hand. "'Time Stop' and 'Large Cracking' are the best match, but I don't know the former. I have the chance to hope for you. Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the most friendly responder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also very eager for 'big cracking'. Ms." Douglas naturally politely reaches out to grip<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando is doing nothing behind. Secretly, how can these old guys who work with each other really cooperate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anord introduced Douglas and Fernando to the heads of other organizations, but did not mention cooperation. It seems that this is a small matter that has long been answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, Annod has always been full of smiles, humorous, and very good atmosphere, which may be the result of him to complete the draw, not other organizations The reason for the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the strong stood up and followed Anord out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the security of this party is unknown, they themselves use substitutes, imaginary, etc., so the magicians brought are not too many, the entire hall is Not full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the coming of the leaders, the whispered discussion in the hall disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, the Twilight War named by the church has been around for more than three hundred years. Many of you may have never experienced the magical life, and suppressed in panic. Born in the middle, growing up in the darkness of despair, and finally may be the death on the fire." When Congos and others sat down, Anord converges with a smile and begins a speech with the help of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy beginning makes the hall quieter, and the older high-ranking mage thinks of the last glory of the empire, and the young mage who feels the same feelings recalls his own experience. But they share a common fear, that is, a nightmare church and a night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod paused for a moment and continued: "In this darkness, our personal strength is so small, only when everyone helps each other, there is hope. Breaking the thorns and welcoming the real dawn, this meeting is to tell everyone that the organization we are present will carry out preliminary cooperation, give up the fight, give up the quarrel, and fight for the survival space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the desperate environment, any good news will be “brained” by the magicians for a better future, so Ann’s words make everyone’s breathing heavy and faint Excited, so many organizations united, should be able to compete against a legendary parish? In the future, there will be more organizations to join...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando grinned slyly, but said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod did not mention the union, he knew that this is unrealistic, and without such strong backing, integrating so many organizations with different minds will only drag on In and of themselves, initial cooperation will help to communicate further in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a good prospect, Anord ended the speech. At this time, the following magician stood up and asked: "How do we survive in the future?" Space?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement of good news has gradually subsided, and more and more magicians are beginning to question and worry, their experience tells them Be cautious to live longer, because they have no more capital and no way to take risks. If they choose the wrong one, it is difficult to have hopes of coming back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, it’s not that stupid." Fernando whispered aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annoyen can’t talk about the true content of cooperation, so he played his own eloquence: “...the success of our cooperation will play a role in demonstration, let More and more magicians join us and attract the attention of the legendary lord... The church is definitely not strong enough to defeat, Aalto has gathered together many legendary powerhouses, and their enemies are blood, dragons, seas, elves, Devils and demons, etc., how many gods are there, how many legendary peaks..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desperate people like to listen to this description, hope The overthrow of the doubts, and they are the elites of their respective organizations, and gradually see that the leaders have secretly reached an agreement, so simply anesthetize themselves with a good future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we can work with the supernatural creatures to extract the elements of magical development from them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Can magic be more than magic? At least on the legendary powerhouse..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced after the speech, the magicians Thoughts are flying, some people think of the benefits of cooperation with extraordinary creatures, think of the development of magic, some people remember the magical trend since the Twilight War... Hope, fear, despair, expectation, all kinds of emotions merged into one furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nielsen, Congers, Plyhill, Amanata, etc. briefly spoke and expressed support, but no one disclosed the specific cooperation content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone is a partner, let me introduce you to the magician next to me, Douglas from Antilles, who is good at 'time stop' , and Fernando raided the referee..." Anord proudly showed the strength of his union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
