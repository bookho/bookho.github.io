			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... After research, the way in which pseudo-god possesses and uses extraordinary ability is completely different from magic and blood, and is different from magical creatures. Value..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... After finding a relic of Lord Tanos with the 'Mirror of Destiny', he found that he is also conducting research on the gods. And it is much ahead of us. It has been secretly preached for hundreds of years. It has condensed the power of faith with special-made articles. Through the mastery of his research materials, our research has made progress in breaking through the surnames, each developed some sects, and divided them. The Sun God of Lord Thanos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, the experimental record of writing special items has been destroyed, Lucien frowned slightly, continue After reading it, this record is very consistent with my initial deduction. After all, for a religion that requires time and number of people to accumulate faith, it is absolutely impossible to suddenly produce the truth and many false gods before and after the Twilight War. Soon stronger, certainly there for decades, or even two or three centuries of development. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in the main material world, any life that is expected to condense the surname of God will be stared at the dead spirit, secretly captured, and falsely caused by natural death. The mystery of faith must be the discovery of false gods from the alien space, just like the ones who have encountered the El Gods, and this has also conquered the hell and the abyss with the "Sun King" Tanos. Space, the situation in which the magic society was pushed to the top of the peak, also answered why it was conquered so many backward alien spaces at that time, but did not find the doubts of the false gods - they were concealed and intercepted by the "Sun King". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the study, I discovered the world of the dead, and I succeeded in creating the first special magic item with the cohesive surname. Oh, this marks that I have embarked on the path of true deities, taking the first step towards the mystery of the world and the dream of immortality..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The condensed god's surname is made, and Lucien's fingers are gently bounced on the experimental recording paper. This means that if you wait for the magician to find a way to steal the surname of the god of the truth, he wants to build the sect by his own development. The magical items take a long time to completely shake the foundation of the church in the short term with the fact that the magician can also make artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I found a world beyond my imagination here, and there is a sacred and bright world in the quietest and deepest death. The light inside is distorted to the appearance of the seven-story mountain peak. Countless angels and transparent spirits with white wings are flying and singing... This is the angel, the Holy Spirit and the Mountain of Heaven envisioned by Lord Thanos? The world is a natural mapping of death customs around, is it similar to this, is it mapped from the Sun God believers group? But it will be here..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The exploration of the immortal chamber failed, I think I understand why the existence of the Necromancer is sleeping near the Chamber of Secrets, why are there such solid evidence that it is immortal? Secrets, without the exploration of the forerunners, these things can't be circulated... Even the gods are seriously hurt in the immortal martyrdom, have to rely on a long time to return to the recovery from the longevity of the fate?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"...Use the 'Mirror of Destiny' again, we found the legacy laboratory of Lord Thanos and saw his experimental record..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next is some of the remaining records of Thanos:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a way to cross the immortal martyrdom, which is to transform myself into a ghost like this and The state of the ancient devil, only in this way, can not be affected by the decomposition and contraction power in the martyrdom. This is just my research direction, immortal chamber, I am coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "... After many unimaginable dangers, I finally pushed open the door of the immortal chamber, but this is the secret of immortality? How can I not see anything, what does this mean? Is it death? God is deceiving me? But the traces of immortality and all kinds of things left here are sure to contain the secret of immortality behind the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God of Death" is Tanos gives the name of the mysterious existence of the dead spirits, and how to convert it. And which need to face the danger, the former being damaged, which is due to Thanos has not yet had time to record, because he was thought of another possibility, he began to break through the level of God - attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Is it because I don’t have a level, so I can’t see the secret of immortality? And I rely on the power of emotion to transform into a similar demon The way of the road breaks through to the gods, there are deep hidden dangers, and there will be big problems at any time! Maybe it is time to try to break through again, as long as you pass this pass and become the real sun god, everything will be fine, then, by time, The level of true God, should you be able to see the secret of immortality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, there was no record of Thanos, and it was transferred back to the experimental records of Maskin and others: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I don’t think Paradise Hill is actually a tower. Created by Lord North, he found a world of angels' death, and then merged the special items he used to condense the surname of the gods with the world of death, creating a powerful paradise beyond his expectations of the paradise mountain! It reached the peak of the gods, and as the power of faith grew, with the arrival of many Holy Spirits, it gradually broke through the limits of the gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ... Lord Tanos should have lost all autonomy in the process of integrating Heaven Mountain. To be precise, he was merged and completely degraded... He became the true God, crossed the limits of the gods, and reached The pinnacle of this world, but I don’t know that I am so powerful, I can only operate according to the pre-set rules like a precise magical array. There is no consciousness, no soul, no, no consciousness is not accurate enough. He has a deep heart in everyone. All The part of consciousness that is hidden, which is influenced by the power of faith..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Lord Thanos left only a platinum scepter. Inside is his rules for Heaven Mountain. Because his body has become a true God, the scepter is shrouded in a strong will. We can only slowly crack it and gradually master it. When we can use it completely, we will use The power of the true God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The preparations for the resurrection left by Lord Tanos seem to have failed. After the perfect body is awakened by us, there is no Any memory and consciousness about the Sun King is a brand new intellectual life. Of course, he benefits from the projection left by the Sun King. The progress of the power is embarrassing. Perhaps he will become the legendary peak earlier than us, according to MacLeod’s Proposal, we gave him a new name: Mecan Tron, the deputy king of heaven and the little sun god, and his true identity is very harmonious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Looking here, Rhine couldn’t help but laugh: It turns out that Mekantron is Tanos. No wonder I always think that he is familiar. I thought it was because I was familiar with every pure beauty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Mecan Tron can not be regarded as the Sun King, soul, consciousness, memory, everything is different." Lucian believes that even if Cantan Tron himself will not think that he is the Sun King Tanos, The god of truth, Tanos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words just finished, Lucien’s mind was like being hit by a giant hammer, squeaking, grabbing the key place, muttering Speaking to himself: "Mecan Tron is the incarnation of the Sun King Tanos, Mecan Tron..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Authentic, isn't this the Sun King's own notes acknowledged? Isn't this recorded by the magician such as Maskillin on the experimental record? Is someone forged? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked and said: "Since the king of angels, Mekantron, is the embodiment of the Sun King Tanos, then only six blazing angels are legendary. The magician refining, the missing seven legendary magicians!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple math problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it was the first time that the refining failed?" The Rhine face was also dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Lucian whispered, and the picture of countless memories in his mind flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical is divided into "six copies" of substitute puppets...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the grey hall Remnant magical array symbolizing the different parts of the six-pointed star...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maskini is rushing to leave the secret lab when he is about to write the inference, leaving only one Ink marks that are shocking inside...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maskillin" screamed screamingly: "Not him, it is him!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information in the underground palace of the Sun King was taken away by Viken, the most important part of the remains, which is a monument not found by Maskin and others...<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken’s extraordinary special summoning ceremony...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposal to destroy the relevant part of the notes is Viking, The first missing is also Viking...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
