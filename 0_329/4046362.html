			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidler City, the headquarters of the pale hand, all year round, haze, sullen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe put his hands in the black long trench coat pocket, looking at the light gray sky outside the window, and the October table was on the front desk. The "Arcane", the yellowed parchment on the one side is only a half-page catalogue, and the other side is the text full of words. The title is written in the bold black body of the big two: "The discovery of a new particle 》. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About only one-thousandth of an atom..." Felipe seems to be talking to a light gray sky with a sense of cohesion. "The speed at which he catches up." It’s faster than I thought, and I can’t slack off. But I’ve not proved that the simple new particle discovery related to the internal structure of the atom should not make him a high-level arcane...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gloomy face has a hint of doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Felipe raised his hand and said to the dark black bracelet: "Mr. Rogerio, find Lucien Evans. Is it something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Rogerio came out of the bracelet: "Yes, there is no confidentiality, the committee can easily access the information. Lippe, the miracle experiment was designed by Lucien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he?" Felipe was shocked and seemed to confirm what For a long time, he suspected that the miracle experiment was related to the professor. Otherwise, the elemental will not find the direction in the short time after the publication of his own paper. He made such a shocking experiment, but he doubted it long ago and doubted it. It seems to be a little pale, a bit squeaky, "Is it a professor who is judged by the church to be sinister, ruthless and ruthless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio also brings A little bit of hatred: "So, I suspect that the progress of overthrowing human life mechanics has been under his control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it should have been an accident at the time, but after he was promoted to the middle class, maybe things would not develop according to our control." Felipe recalled the situation at the time. Judging from Lucien’s coping and emotional changes, his wisdom must not have been included in the plan and pretending to be so good. It should be said that in addition to the “Prophet,” other legendary magicians. There is no way, even if the "prophet" is planning to be similar to his own strength, even when there are still superior enemies, it is difficult to predict and grasp most of the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that thanks to Traquil's assassination, disrupting his plan and letting things move in the direction we want." Rogerio doesn't know It’s a satirical Traquel, or I’m really lucky. “Well, Felipe, Lucien Evans is a member of the Arcane Review Board. It’s already happening, don’t care too much, at least your magic. The level is overwhelming him, and he has only five rings. Even if there are more high-level magic items, it will be very dangerous to face the inevitable revenge of the church in the next few years. Maybe one or two years later we have to participate in his real Funeral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only regret is that Lucien Evans has recently been closely guarded and the church will certainly not choose this parliamentary high alert. The timing of the assassination, we have to wait a year or two to appreciate this good show.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a member of the Panel, very clear that Lucien has Held a funeral and knew the ferocious Felipe Granting "Lusien Evans has always been stunned and regarded him as the biggest competitor - even if the two are good at only the elements and the alchemy overlap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A few years later..." Felipe shook his head. At that time, the professor was likely to be promoted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubt that Lucien can The only doubt that he became a high-level magician before he was thirty was how long he could advance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sharing information to Felipe through electromagnetic communication, Luo Gerio interrupted the contact, he was busy with his own research, and the influence factor of "Magic" was raised to 3.0, letting him see the hope of being promoted to the eighth-class arcian in ten years.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hoarse snoring inside the bracelet, and then calmed down. Felipe sighed softly and whispered in a tone: "Miracle experiment...new particles..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, Lucien? Evans Commissioner! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe was not surprised. He turned his head slowly: "There is nothing happy and unhappy. This has inspired my passion for arcane research. The influencing factors of "Arcane" and "Magic" are 3.0. If I finish a few more highs. Evaluation and high-discussion papers can enter the ranks of high-ranking arcans within one year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not far from the sixth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair on the opposite side of the desk slowly emerges with a figure, no, a facial muscle rots and solidifies, the white bone is clearly visible, and he wears a picture The black robes of the gorgeous and bizarre pattern, like humans, joked and said: "Do you need me to help you? I have no research on arcane, but I know several places in the dead world and some unique materials to enhance your magical power. Very helpful, as long as you sign a companion contract with me, within five years, you can step into the ranks of the seven-ring magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Angus, My things will be done by myself, I don't need your heart. You have to remember that you are just a high-ranking undead that I summoned. I am your master. When I don't need you to talk, you are quiet. Do you understand?" Felipe's deep eyes looked at Angus with pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angus's bone shelf made a soft whistle: "Yes, my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hands back into the black trench coat pocket, Felipe walked to the door of the study, and when he passed away with Angus, he said as if he had told the servant: "Good. I am ready to start the magic experiment, no parliament or Organize emergency information, don't let anyone bother me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, Master." Angus replied with a compliment, and waited for Felipe's back to disappear. At the door, he whispered: "Proud to stupid idiot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hallway, Felipe’s mouth sneered a little sneer: "Idiot, die Can the souls of the spiritual world not send a guy with a normal IQ to sign a contract with the master and servant? Is it an idiot who will be tempted to face such a strange world situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step into the Magic Tower Lab, launch the Defense Magic Array, and Felipe's expression becomes focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab is cold and chilly, faintly white, and the anatomical table in front of Felipe lies a white, lifeless human body-- This is a volunteer who comes from money collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used after death, the corpse was dissected for life enjoyment and family happiness. For many bottom-level poor people, there is no need to consider it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last experiment, this dead body has round eyes, and the dark blue pupil reflects Felipe's cold and gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a silver-white dagger, and his right hand did not tremble and cut, and opened his chest and took out a dark red heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is placed in the magical array, and Felipe goes to another dissecting table, lying on top of a powerful undead, ghoul The advanced "devil", the individual is short, like a child, the skin of the body is rotten, stinking, revealing the bones inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe is unaffected, also use the dagger to open the chest, carefully remove the rotten pus black heart and put the magic just now Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspire the magic array to get a lot of interference, Felipe cut a thin piece from each of the two hearts, then picked up a bottle of reagents and put them At the same time dyed silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Felipe put them into the observation magic array, magnified the scene, and observed what changes have occurred in the cell organization at the level of the undead creatures that humans and humans have become. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's still not big enough to see the small details..." Felipe's face focused on adjusting the magic array became more and more gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn sorcerer! It turned out to be him!" Bahá'u'lláh's roar reverberated in Felipe's study, full of violent anger, " I will judge him and cleanse him by hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is certain that he is the devil, and he is a devil who is good at grasping the heart! Otherwise, how can he write hypocritically? "Ode to Joy"?!" Warren Hill gritted his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
