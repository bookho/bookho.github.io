			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 11th, meeting room of the highest jury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixteen members, including the seven arcane masters, have already taken their seats, and at this time, they changed back to Lucien, a black double-breasted long dress. I came in from the outside and smiled apologetically: "Sorry, late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, last night was your wedding night, very late Normal.” Alchemist master Klaus smirked and said, “We all understand.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing his jokes, others laughed in good faith Either there is no expression change, only Hathaway looks at Lucien indifferently, seemingly blaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly slammed his chin and explained to the "Mother Mother": "The wounds of Natasha's abdomen are infected by the power of time. Even if he uses high-level medical treatment with alchemy medicine every day, it will take at least half a month to completely improve, but she herself does not forget the sword that killed John Contonia in the end, trying to grasp the burning heart and let the will, The feeling of fusion of faith, spirit and blood, I am afraid that her injury will deteriorate, she can only work hard to cooperate with her and stop her from making bigger moves. Until a few minutes ago, she fell asleep and fell asleep."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my lateness is definitely not the reason you think, but when it comes to exploring and simulating that sword, she also expresses "thank you" in other ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather’s eyes are softer, and Douglas laughs and laughs: “Don’t explain it to us, this is your own business. Our emergency meeting today is mainly Discussing yesterday's events, the Flame of the Source, the night watchman of the church, was able to invite the legendary undead in the depths of the dead, so it is hard to doubt whether the church is seeking cooperation in the spiritual world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cooperation between the Southern Church and the Necromancers, which specializes in purifying undead creatures? Will it be just a private move of the flame of origin? He is the legendary magician of the ancient magical empire, maybe he is dead. The spiritual world is profound." Oliver analyzed another possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s serious expression, the door is very loud: “For whatever reason, we must speed up the exploration of the dead world, this bone shelf, rotten corpse look It is not satisfied with the dominance of the dead world, but also wants to reach out to the main material world. It is not what we expected in the past. After the mysterious existence of the dead world relapses into a deep sleep, they also calm down and have enough time for us to squander. Therefore, it is difficult for us to respond effectively if we do not understand their details as quickly as possible. In this case, we cannot wait passively."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to them At that time, the soul of the dead dominated Vicente and remained silent. The dark red flame in the eyelids jumped slightly, seemingly indifferent to the things of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook’s voice is low and low: “There is really a need to speed up the exploration process, but in the depths of the death temple, after the soul fireplace, what danger is hidden, I am completely I don't know, you must take care and be careful and take risks. You can't be reckless. You know, Masjilin, Viken and other ancient legendary magicians are missing there. Although there are no legendary peaks among them, most of them are three. The order is the absolute core of the ancient magical empire, and its strength is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Congos incident, Lucien will talk about Maskillin Organized into a report to the parliament, let them clearly know the reasons for the disappearance of legendary magicians such as Maskillin, and the real process of the collapse of the big cross-frame lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my goal for the time being is to first explore the soul fireplace, not rushing deeper, and then returning after a preliminary understanding of the soul fireplace and the peripheral area, then, Batch out those legendary undead creatures without intelligence, and then make a second adventure plan, consider the in-depth things." Douglas is very rational and very calm, but the words are quite atmospheric, as if those are not smart The powerful undead is just like ordinary cockroaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to those legendary undead creatures without intelligence, there are about ten legendary undead souls like the Lich King, not so good. Dealing with it is no less than a full-scale war." The soul of the dead dominated Vicente for a long time and began to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien listened quietly to their discussion, and weighed it in the heart. Suddenly, she raised her hand: "There is one thing, I want to explain."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Fernando’s red eyes looked over. What secrets did he hide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spiritual objects?" Oliver, Erica, and others were slightly surprised to ask, in the era of Muskillin's disappearance, the truth of the gods has not yet surfaced, where did he come from the magical items? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not know what he said before, saying: "Mr. Muskilllin calls it a magic item."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" This time, even Douglas, Brooke, Hathaway, Helen, Davy and others couldn't help but be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is reason to suspect that they are closely related to the emergence of the Truth." After so many things, witnessing the improvement of the Pope's magic, Lucy En finally able to speak his suspicion with confidence and confidence. "Maybe it is related to the conjecture in the report of the change of the name of the god of the gods I submitted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From A lot of weak mental power FM aggregation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." After a brief silence, Brooke took a white handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead. "The projection of Heaven Mountain exists, angel." Really, the king of angels is now in the holy city of Lance, and we can't find it as if it is a magical technique. Even if we don't use God's surname to make artifacts, we can't do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So further exploration is needed. Mr. Muskilllin’s last layer of '曰之冕' hides the coordinate transformation of somewhere in the deepest part of the Necromancer, most likely they are missing. Regional, that may have all the answers." Lucien said in a deep voice, and generously shared the rules of coordinate transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of the dead is too dangerous. It is absolutely impossible to go deep on it. It must rely closely on the power of the parliament. In this case, concealing important information will only bring risky action. The danger that can be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the rules of coordinate transformation, all members of the highest appraisal group briefly fell into meditation and weighed things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued: "I have to explain another thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Fernando waited for Lucien, how many secrets this guy still has! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the beginning, the Earl of Silvereye was not trapped by Prince Dracula, but because he wanted to explore the secrets of the souls of the dead, and joined forces with Thrall. Dealing with the Lord of the Silver, the Duke of Frost, Tiffettis, was trapped by Thrall during the exploration process." Lucian corrected the false information he had given in order to protect himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando seems to have guessed his mouth, and Hathaway nodded slightly, only to understand why Thrall was working with himself: "What secret?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead soul dominated the flames of Vicente's eyes and suddenly violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of Silvereye tells me this way, in the depths of the dead spirit, hiding the secrets that lead to true immortality, even the god of the silver moon, Aitna I also want to pursue the secret!" Lucien said this secret that has suppressed himself for a long time. Now, he is a legendary magician, and the comprehensive combat power is equal to the second-order, and is no longer a weak person. Strength to share this secret! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message was so shocking that in addition to the stagnation of the soul of the dead, the other members of the highest panel of judges were difficult to react at first, first guessing the accuracy of the message. surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The action of Lord of the Hell, Mardi Moss, also indirectly proves the important surname of the secret in the depths of the dead spirit." Lucien explained the hell. The plan before the Lord, "I am not sure about this information. It just reminds everyone that after the soul fireplace, anything can happen, and it may directly face the coming of the god of silver moon and the Lord of hell." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is true, they will be happy to see us delve deeper and even help. If they are willing to take risks, they will have entered." Douglas returned Exalted, slightly smiling, does not seem to be very excited about the mystery of immortality, it is not as good as when I saw the general theory of relativity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, even Hathaway, Helen, a magician with very little expression, are faintly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he looks to the soul of the dead: "Vicente, do you know the existence of such a secret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
