			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alto Golden Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You asked to kill the night watchman captain 'Clown'?" Cardinal Cosser, although checking out the physical condition of the road, said to Nata Sha's angry reaction was expected, but he did not expect Natasha to be so radical and his attitude would be so strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha's silver-purple eyes are crystal clear, like a dream, and the tone is very serious: "Yes, the clown must be executed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a cardinal, Cossé can maintain a warm and loving expression, and he said in a good tone: "His Royal Highness, Mr. Evans has no problem, no death, no jealousy, no disability, Why do you have to keep up with it? And it may not be done by a clown. At that time, Mr. Evans may have misread the person, most likely a cultist in the Silver Horn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Catherine, if you think that Lucien admits the wrong person, let the clown stand up, accept his identification and inquiry, and use the magic to lie, I think this should be able to understand everything. Natasha's imposing manner has caused a great sense of oppression for Cosser. After all, everyone is a high-ranking player. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Natasha’s proposal, Cossé was silent for a moment, because both him and the head of the referee had reason to believe that it was done by the clown. The nobility was found to be lying under the eyes of the aristocrats. The clown did not attack a high-ranking social figure in accordance with normal procedures. The prestige of the church would be hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Cossé continued to use his kind voice: "Well, let's assume that the clown is doing it. But why should he do this? It is clear that Mr. Evans may have a relationship with the evil character of the 'Professor' purification sequence. In order to prevent evil from invading the Vaurit Principality and invading Aalto and the nobles, the clown will venture into temptation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But is there evidence? Is there any real evidence?" Natasha stepped forward and her eyes were full of majesty. "Cathed by Cossack, now is not the late Twilight War, not the night watchman. Suspect who is a magician, who doubts who has a relationship with the magician, can simply arrest them by suspicion and slowly interrogate or directly test the time of temptation and inspection. Today, you can almost kill Lucien because of the evil of delusion? Evans, can you kill a nobleman directly because of the same suspicion tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think any nobles are willing to live in this kind of aristocracy." Uneasy environment I don’t want to worry about whether there will be a church night watchman suddenly breaking into his house and arresting or killing himself with no shadow evidence!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strong knights may not worry about themselves, but they are equally afraid that their wives and their children will encounter similar things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words of sternness and aggressiveness After the words, Natasha became louder: "Bishop Cossack, I represent all the nobles of the Vaurit Principality to demand the execution of the clown, and shock all the vigils who dare to violate the agreement between the church and the nobility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a few hundred years ago, you don’t have to listen to Natasha’s “unreasonable” request. Bishop Goss is somewhat helpless, but the confrontation between the North and the South Church and the Magic Council The rise of the aristocracy, which itself represents a powerful force, has rapidly increased. When they unite, they can already contend with the church on certain issues and decide on the decision of the church. This matter is a bit offensive to the bottom line of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you are a devout aristocrat, the previous treatment is very good. And Mr. Evans has no major events, even if the clown is guilty, it is not yet needed. At the point of execution." Gossip softened, first trying to weaken her tough stance with Natasha's devout faith, and then throwing a low-key, acceptable approach. "It is better to let the referee's internal court try the clown. Give him the punishment he deserves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha drew a cross on his chest: "On the truth forever."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she solemnly said: "I am a devout believer, so I don't even want to see a crazy guy like a clown in the night watchman destroying the relationship between the church and the nobility."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she looked straight at Goce and passed her strong will:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The clown is not dead, all nobles can't Peace of mind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha nodded. "I believe that Cardinal and Lord Amorton understand the serious surname of this matter. I am waiting for the final result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............ Atoll is in an ordinary villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown is looking at the collected information carefully, trying to find clues from it, confirming Lucien? Evans has a very strong relationship with the professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and the battle priest Juliana came in anxiously: "Captain, fast, run away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Julianna, what happened? Calm down." The clown raised his head and looked at Juliana with that funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana took two deep breaths: ‘Captain, the referee decided to execute you, you are going to escape! ""what? ! How can this be? ! Even the fifth-level knight, the will is amazing, the clown can't help but be surprised and ask, there seems to be a feeling of being abandoned by the whole world. I work hard for the Lord, for the church, for the referee to fight evil and eliminate the darkness. Actually, it will be executed by the referee?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana is not sure whether this secret hiding place has been exposed, can only make a long story short: "Captain, ended an hour ago 'Return to the concert', Lucien? Evans was seriously ill and fell to the center of the stage. He was confirmed by the Bishop of Cosser as a disease caused by the failure of the previous injury. Natasha was very angry and no longer compromised. He was backed by the entire aristocratic class and asked the church to execute you. From the news revealed by the adventure of Lord Lund, the church has retreated, ready to secretly arrest you, and then secretly executed in exchange for the satisfaction and non-promotion of the nobles. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Execute me...kill me?" "The clown can't accept the whisper, the voice is filled with frustration, despair, and sorrow, in stark contrast to the exaggerated smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliana thought he I don't believe it, I quickly explained: "The relationship between Captain Lund and us has not been good before the Melzer Black Forest incident. Later, it was also very alienated from us. So the referees gathered several people to gather information and arrest you. He was selected. After accepting the task, he immediately revealed it to me, let me inform you to run away, leave Aalto, go to other places to hide for a while, and then return to another identity. There are a lot of sympathy for you in the adults of the referee! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown’s whisper stopped, like a lost soul, and when Juliana wanted to urge him again, he suddenly laughed. Get up:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter is full of crazy meanings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, are you okay?" Juliana was worried about the authenticity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter came to an abrupt end, and the clown said in an unusually calm voice: "I'm fine, just feel very funny." A musician who has a close relationship with the evil magician, a princess with a deep connection with the Magic Council, can force the church to kill his most devout and most loyal dark guard. Is this the church of the magicians or the church of the Lord? How can Lord Sald, Amorton, and Cossés condone and allow such things to happen? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, don't care what the big guys think, I believe you, Minsk believes you, Lord Lund believes you, many night watchers believe in you, There are also two sympathizers in the three adults of the referee! I believe that light will eventually defeat the darkness, and sacredness will defeat evil! Juliana was a little excited and seemed to be stimulated as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clown shook his head: "Juliana, you don't have to worry about my emotional out of control, no one is extraordinary." How can I control the blood of the fifth level? I will hide well, then find evidence and testify to Lucien in front of everyone. Evans returned to the referee in a bright and honest manner. Oh, if you can kill Lucien in front of Natasha? Evans, let her look at it but unable to recover, then it is best. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, don't you be reckless, this time Lucien? There must be a lot of protection and ambush around Evans, maybe you want to seduce you and kill you! Juliana hurriedly reminded her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she knows that it is not difficult to control her emotions with the will of the clown, she will not make stupid mistakes, but she also understands the dark surname. The quality of the blood is more or less with a crazy factor.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
