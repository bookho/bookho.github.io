			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second to remember [Www.biquwo.com], this site provides you with free novels for free reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--go--><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Soul Library, "Stars and Elements The book was opened page by page, and Lucien translated the ancient Ilvanas magic empire texts that were mastered today in the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can see the meaning..." After completing the translation today, Lucien found that many sentences were either complete or not too important. The part does not affect the interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many professional magic words, Lucien has long used the witch notes to reverse the previous apprenticeship content, so began to seriously read this ancient Magic books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Astrology and Elements provides a few higher levels of meditation, but Lucien draws on the lessons of the witches and does not try them. After all, my strengths are knowledge, not mental strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When meditation, directly constructing a spell model in the soul with the four elements of the earth's feng shui, can you directly exempt the casting materials and spells?" Grace and thoughts on how to become a formal magician's passage, which explains in detail how to construct a spell model, and also let Lucien's long-standing doubts have a direction of guessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien began to learn magic and has been puzzled by a question. If the change in the frequency of mental power fluctuations can explain the principle of no spell casting, then After constructing the spell model, what is the reason for casting materials? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The material or "element" required for each magic is different, such as "acid sputtering" with sulfur, if the application is exempted, the composition of the acid Where did the elements come from? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can think of very few explanations, or the air contains all the elements, so you can call them directly, or use more essential things to change, For example, magical energy, but after seeing the description of "The Book of Astrology and Elements", Lucien has further speculation: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems ancient The magician used the fire feng shui as the four basic elemental bismuth phosphines. There is no reason. They seem to be able to construct all the magic, which just confirms my guess that the ground fire feng shui is the four basic forces, whether it is the nature of the elements, or Physical properties are actually different external manifestations of the four basic forces. With them, you can construct all the magic, so you can cast spells free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This guess is correct. Does that mean that the microscopic level of the world is similar to Earth? Are there different particles? Perhaps they are the 'magic elves' mentioned by ancient magicians?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can force be directly mastered and applied? Just like the gravitation of the 'ring of control'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No experimental conditions, no experimental ability, Lucien can only Be bold and assume that you will be careful later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After carefully and repeatedly reading the passages of the spell model in the soul, Lucien browsed the specific magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Astrology and Elements is the heritage of a legendary magician of the ancient magical empire. The ancestor of the witch is his student, so this magic book records The star system, the element is the most magic of the first to the nine rings, and the other is the basic magic of the front five rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient magical empire, magic is divided into two basic and unique. The basic magic is the magic of the same model and the same effect of the empire. The only magic is The wisdom of every powerful magician is unique and different from other people's magic. For example, in The Book of Stars and Elements, starting from the Third Ring, each ring has two or three unique magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the penultimate chapter of the magic book, Lucien sees a striking title:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Advanced approach to two legendary professions." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives way to the spirit of Lucien, the legend represents the top of the world, but the more down the road is dizzy, not only words The language of the ordinary magical empire is difficult to understand, and the two models that are complex to the extreme seem to absorb the spiritual power of Lucien and make him tired and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the words that can be understood, Lucien knows that these two legendary occupations are the "element dominator" of the elemental system and the "prophet" of the star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name of the listener is very powerful..." Lucien slowly recovered his spirit. "And if you want to advance the legend, it seems that you have to prepare a lot." A precious and unusual material, and then a huge magical ritual, and it seems that there is more than one legendary career in each magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Astrology The last chapter of the Book of Elements is the recipe for many magical potions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning through the magic book, Lucien chose the magic that he constructed when he advanced to the official magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Lucien’s choice is the same as that of the witch, but the witch’s attempt to resolve the “Mage Armor”, Lucien It is the "Starlight Shield". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After transcribing this magical translation and model onto the magic notes, Lucien began experimenting with parsing, based on the assumptions just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a thorough analysis and mastery of this magic, Lucien will choose another ring of magic transcripts, because as a formal magician, it is not only Construct a model within the soul, except that each construction takes time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ A ring of magic relative to apprenticeship magic, from plane to solid, greatly improved complexity, and Lucien is based on his own assumptions As a premise, the analysis was very slow, and it was only after the bells in the early morning that it was just a clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sly face, Lucien stood up from the lounge chair and felt the extreme weakness and exhaustion of the soul. This is just reading the magic book and analyzing the magic. Too much spiritual reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the living room, returning to the master bedroom, lying in the soft velvet quilt, because it is too tired, the spirit can not relax, Lucien is unable to sleep for a long time Even hypnosis doesn't seem to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien simply got up from the bed, went into the small piano room in the bedroom cubicle, sat in front of the piano, opened the lid, and wanted to play the music. Come relax yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacting and learning music for more than four months, Lucien has become accustomed to playing musical instruments and found that he can temporarily forget all kinds of worries and worries while playing the piano. Immerse yourself in the world of music and get peace of mind or relaxation, so use it as an effective way to relax and rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finger moves lightly and unrestrainedly on the keys, Lucien empties his mind, the melody naturally produces, skilled passages, and improvisation Unformatted play, whether it is good or not, is like expressing your inner feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes of emotions hopped back and forth in the piano room. Lucien's whole person became calm, the spirit gradually relaxed, and sleepiness finally came into being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just stood up and prepared to close the lid, Lucien suddenly heard a round of applause on the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly looking back, Lucien was full of alert, but a lazy and mature voice came immediately: "I don't think Lu Xien has sadness in your heart. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, Princess Royal, it is best to knock in the door in the middle of the night, going straight to the balcony will scare people." Lucien reluctantly saw Natasha and Camille stood on the balcony of their bedroom, wearing a black knight suit and applauding across the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and said: "My historian, did you read the knight novels during this time? Every knight is through the window." And the balcony to go to the party to love the girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien’s memory is outstanding, reading the historical documents is so strong that he is so many when he communicates with Baker. The historian needed to find information to remember the historical events, Lucian can speak quickly and smoothly, which made Baker very surprised and secretly told Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is not surprised by this. After becoming a knight, the memory will also be enhanced, but the knight who can stimulate the blood will not think of becoming history. Home, and she also knows from Victor that Lucien’s memory “original” is very good, so there is no doubt about Lucien, just humorously calling Lucien a “new historian”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
