			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the whispering exchange, Felice turned and saw that Anne and Colin all had signs of talking with Lucien. They couldn’t help but smile. They seem to be I want to satisfy my curiosity and congratulations to Lucien, but I am afraid that the closeness is the real purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Felice took Lucien half behind her and patted her palm gently. She smiled very beautifully: "Ladies and gentlemen, In order to celebrate the great success of Mr. Victor's concert, in order to celebrate our classmate Lucian becoming a recognized genius in the music industry, I would like to invite everyone to attend the dance at my estate on the 5th night. This matter has been approved by Mr. Victor. Now I want to know your wishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Felice, she has a close relationship with Lucien, with the help of Moonlight Rose. Therefore, subconsciously, I don't want to have a deep friendship with Lucien and other students. This resource is of course the best. However, she also understands that she can't interfere with Lucien's life. Only more exchanges, more entanglements and exchange of interests are the best way to maintain relationships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renee reacted first and smiled brightly: "Really? It’s my pleasure to be able to visit Miss Felice on your estate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her promise, Lott, Anne and Herodotus also replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis saw everyone willing to accept his invitation, so he turned and kept a beautiful smile: "What about you, Lucien? You Would you like to go to my estate as a guest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly came up with an idea and smiled and replied: "Of course, this is my honor, Philippine Lisi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Lucien agreed, the expression of Renee and others seemed to be a little more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the rejuvenated Victor took the book and walked down the second floor: "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, start our study, the ball There are still a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was free to find a position and was ready to sit down. When he passed away with Lott, Lott made up To Lucien’s ear, he whispered: “I heard that McCannz doesn’t like you very much and may find you trouble. Of course, you are already a music consultant for His Royal Highness, and he can’t help you directly. But it’s very likely Design traps make you ugly and discredit your reputation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Lott, I will be careful." Lucien politely thanked himself, but he There is a mood and energy to consider this aspect. Saving the Joel family is like a firefighting. Every day, the hope of a successful rescue is less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Lucien also knows that you can’t act recklessly, you have to wait patiently for opportunities and make all kinds of preparations, because this is a very dangerous thing, the more If you want to solve it quickly, the less successful it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien’s current state is like walking on the wire between the two cliffs. The left side is slow and procrastinating, and the right side is impetuous and reckless. No matter which side you are leaning, you will fall to the bottom of the cliff and you will be able to succeed only if you maintain a perfect and extremely difficult balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of Lucien's writings has been almost completed with the help of his super memory and good learning methods. What is lacking is the accumulation of uncommon words, so this afternoon Lucien and Lott and Felice are all learning music. For Lucien, immersing yourself in learning also helps you stay calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of calmness, combined with the information that was obtained and tested in these two days, a bold plan gradually formed in the mind of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the study, Lucien returned to his cabin and packed up some items to bring to the garden villa he rented at No. 116 in Jisu District. This looks like It was a very normal process of slowly moving, so at night, only one sentence was said on the white paper: "Mr. Evans, please be sure to keep your cleverness in the Lata Summer Palace tomorrow, don't do stupid things, otherwise the consequences will be up to you. Responsible for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet night passed quickly, Lucien With a calm hold and a little hypnosis in the "Star of the Stars", I don't have to sleep because of anxiety, and I sleep very hard. I wake up and have a good spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no new order on the white paper. After using the breakfast, Lucien went to the Musicians Association, occupied a small piano room, and used the piano to distract and let himself not be so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s a life that has changed dramatically in recent days, so that Lucien has the feeling of being played by fate, with countless difficulties and dangers, maybe Recently, I have been watching Beethoven's various music, so after a sturdy melody of destiny, Lusien took a short break and subconsciously bounced Beethoven's eighth piano sonata in c minor, also known as "The famous" Compassion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the pinnacle of Beethoven’s early piano music. Although it is called "Sorrow", it is actually in the same line as "The Symphony of Destiny". The sorrow and sorrow creates a tragic atmosphere that contrasts with the steadfastness of the melody, expressing the heroic spirit of suffering, hardship and destiny, and the will to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has never practiced this piano, so even if you can clearly remember all the notes, it will be intermittent, no beauty, but this kind of intermittent The feeling is more close to the complex contradictions of Lucien's inner anxiety, depression, and forcing calmness. Therefore, Lucien is playing over and over again until it feels exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the vent of music, Lucien felt that his mood and mentality had remained in a relatively good state, so he left the piano room and rested in his lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 10:30, the door to the lounge was ringing, and Elena’s voice came in:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, the carriage of His Royal Highness Princess to pick you up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Lucien was on the chair Slowly stood up and replied: "Okay, Elena, I will go down immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished a black jacket and a wide lace cuff After the white shirt, Lucien looked at the mirror in the black and black for thirty seconds, then calmly and calmly walked out of the lounge to the lobby on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage of Natasha is dark purple, with the coat of arms of the Violet family, with a low-key exterior and luxurious interior. Lucien sitting inside does not feel at all. To a little bump and jitter, the dark yellow carpet from Tria created a warm atmosphere, but Lucien kept a straight-forward attitude and did not pick up the blood red on the small table in front of him. Items such as wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the carriage reached Lata Summer Palace on time, the main entrance was a stone gate with numerous hero statues, and more than a dozen soldiers in red military uniforms. He was guarded by a muscular rifle and a mighty knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After simply checking out the possession of Lucien, the guardian waved and let the carriage pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the gate, Lucien quickly felt the solemn and horrifying magical atmosphere, and they seemed to envelope the entire Lata Summer Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lata Summer Palace is a pale golden building with a majestic appearance and finely crafted. The two sides are symmetrical and two majestic The castle-like palace, connected to them is a delicate and gorgeous palace complex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lata Summer Palace is a large square with a fountain in front of it, and the square is surrounded by a beautiful garden with a small half of the market area. A variety of exotic trees and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man-made river that can travel a few sailboats flashes through the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriages carrying Lucien passed through the garden avenue, crossed the long bridge on the artificial river, and stopped in front of the main palace. The two beautiful maids had already waited for Here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Evans, please come with us to the piano room of His Royal Highness Princess." The two beautiful blonde girls who seem to be twins use the same crisp sound. Salute to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded politely: "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two maids Under the leadership of Lu Xien, through the magnificent palaces, they are made of top-grade patterned rocks of various colors, emitting a dazzling array of colors, stairs, railings and other places wrapped in gold foil, according to the theme of different palaces, There are also giant crystals, pure white gauze and epic oil paintings on the inner walls and domes. Every detail is full of elaborate and flamboyant glitz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
