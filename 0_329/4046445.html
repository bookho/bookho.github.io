			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa surrounded by flowers, Milina is looking at Lucien’s paper that proves the tower geometry and Levski geometry with unit circle, again It was shocked by the beauty of mathematics. After a long time, I wrote it: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fantastic ideas, simple arguments, fully demonstrate the beauty of mathematics, It also proves the compatibility between Levsky's new geometry and tower geometry, and undoubtedly announces the establishment of a new geometric system, subverting the mathematical world composed of real experience and intuitive understanding, revealing the additional development of mathematics and argumentation. A road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This paper has a very important position in proving the establishment of a new geometric system. The mathematical ideas contained in it are worthy of our exploration and have a certain starting name. , to establish a reward for the Arcane points forty, the Arcane point is five hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mirina gave the assessment results in strict accordance with the auditing standards, did not let their own preferences Play a role, or else as an authority in the field of mathematics, one Scientist, she will give a higher evaluation and reward of this paper is full of mathematical beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost simultaneously, Sarguero is also reviewing Lucien "An attempt to explain the geometry of non-towers": <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The paper gives a mathematical model that violates the intuitive understanding but exists in reality, proving that Levski geometry The establishment made a breakthrough in the surname, let us really realize that this is indeed a new geometric system that is essentially different from the geometry of the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In view of this The mathematical model and the proof process break through the contribution of the surname in the new geometry field, the very important position, and the content that is worth exploring and researching itself, and the establishment of the reward Arcane points 60, the Arcane point 600."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of putting down the pen, Sarguero discovered that the dark night of the winter had already arrived. The wind outside was whistling and dark, but from this cold darkness, he seemed to see a little light. The bright future of the mathematical field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the new geometry has a real sense of arcane..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ivan The idea of ​​axiomatization seems a bit interesting..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One week After the morning, Samantha went to the tower as usual to follow the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Ms. Samantha." Several familiar low-level arcans met with Samantha and said hello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, the dome is full of darkness, inlaid with a magical crystal lamp for lighting, which is distributed according to different galaxies and different constellations, like a picture A huge star map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha solemnly but politely nodded and then sighed slightly: "Leo, Gina, what have you been doing so early?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as she knows, these low-level Arcanists’ teachers, her friends, the four-level Arcanist, and the five-ring astrologer Dasera, never The students were taught on Friday, and now at this point in time, the labs and libraries in the tower are not yet open, so it is not necessary to come so early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Samantha, don't you know? Yesterday, the tower issued a notice, and today there will be a new issue of journals, we are very curious, so Waiting in advance." Gina, a lovely face, answered honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha spent the first two days watching the stars in the night, in order to improve one of his new magic, so he did not come to the tower, but naturally I didn't hear about it. At this time, her face changed slightly, and muttered to herself: "The new journal, is the book inscription by Lucien Evans?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't know." Leo, who had been blessed for less than twenty-five, shook his head stunnedly, and Ms. Samantha seemed to know more than herself. many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Samantha, are you also buying Nature?" Rachel’s lively greetings came from behind Samantha, she always It is so youthful, full of vigor and vitality, giving people the feeling of sunshine, so that when they see her mood, they can't help themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel deliberately sighed: "Yes, as a member of the Arcane Review Committee, the top of the tower, my teacher, Ms. Isabella, should have been treated directly, but she went out to explore and find new ones. The illusion material has gone, I can only pity myself to buy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Rachel, Gina and others are obviously more respectful, and they She is unfamiliar. Secondly, Rachel is the winner of the wizard's laurels. At present, the crystal-clear hairpins on the linen hairs are particularly shocking to their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the content and inscription of Nature?" Samantha asked subconsciously, otherwise Rachel would not have to come to the tower so early, in her capacity. Still afraid of buying status? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel looked at Samantha doubtfully: "I don't know, but as a journal's inaugural issue, how commemorative and collectible, especially yourself Buy it by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Samantha found herself forgetting her friend's collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the high tower library at the back of the reception desk opened, and the two female apprentices who were responsible for the reception moved out a few thick black books from the inside. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call, I have to see what direction this affiliated journal of "Star" is." Rachel is curious about Samantha Road while pulling She walked quickly to the reception desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha’s expression of reminiscence: “Should it be related to mathematics?” This is what her teacher Nessica occasionally mentioned, and she is returning the results of the review to the teacher. When she saw Lucien? Evans's new geometric paper was swelled by the proposition that turned away from common sense and inexplicable propositions. The subconsciously resisted and almost could not understand. But soon, she was shocked by the mathematical model provided later, and read it back again. The logic of negotiation and the appropriate model persuasion, let her experience a brain concussion similar to the shaken of the cognitive world, in a state of paradox, only after two or three days, began to accept the fact that the new geometry does exist. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, did the tall tower finally decide to do a paper in the direction of mathematics? This is a wonderful thing!" Rachel became quite Excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians who came from their towers have more or less complex feelings in the field of mathematics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two girls, can you come to two new journals?" Rachel came up with his own magic badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Rachel, you don't have to be so polite." After getting the wizard's laurels, there are very few people who don't know Rachel inside the tower. The two young girls handed the magic badge into the magic circle and deducted the arcane point, and handed the two new journals to Rachel and Samantha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" In Rachel’s exclamation, the serious and calm Samantha couldn’t wait to see the front of the journal, the teacher’s sentence. Let her be curious for a whole week! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cover is modeled after "Arcane", with dark black as the base, the silver lines outline a mathematical symbol, formula, theorem, number, special geometry, which are respectively gathered It is like a star in the dark universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drawing the truth of the world in a mathematical language..." This is what Samantha directly associates with after seeing the cover, and she believes this is the true meaning. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the starry sky, there is a large silver-gray word "natural", which is written in a special squiggly form, and ten letters are like a wonderful formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under nature, there are a few smaller words:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eyes Will deceive you..." Next to it is the number in the visible range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ears will deceive you..." The same is the number of human ear hearing ranges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your experience will deceive you..." is followed by a simple but significant formula in calculus, 0.99999...=1<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
