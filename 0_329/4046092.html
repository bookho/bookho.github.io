			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen’s blood force made him irritable, but he also gave him a keen instinct, so after the whip was waved, he did not smoke to Joe. And Eliza, but the wrist flicked, the direction changed, and then pulled back, while his eyes became red, his muscles bulging together, black leather and clothes as if they were about to split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip was driven by his horrible power, and almost no shadows were seen. The sharp, harsh voice rang after the whip was pumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who was prepared, halfway, tiptoe, changed direction, escaped Jensen’s whip, and then held the dagger in his hand A stroke, easily cut this ordinary leather whip, and then continue to pounce on Jensen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Jensen pulled out the whip, I turned quickly and ran towards the wooden table because his weapon was on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a light hand, the whip was broken, but Jensen, who had a red eye, had already taken the three heads in his hand and was ready to hit Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien not only did not advance, but suddenly stopped, the fine powder in his hand slipped, and a huge roar in an almost closed cell. It sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the roaring sound was carefully measured and selected before Lucien, and Jensen’s ear slammed, his mind was short and dizzy, and he couldn’t hold it. However, he is a formal knight and instantly got rid of this influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim and other four knights stood in different places in the room, and they were still in a state of sorrow. For the iron gate was knocked open, the afterimage was thrown in, Zhan Sen’s wave of whip, picking up flail and other fast-moving things was completely unresponsive, so the loud noise in the closed room made them dizzy, their heads creaked, and all stood unsteadily on the ground. I can't climb for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And away from the roaring position of Joel, Alisa, because the physique is far less than the Cavaliers attendance, in the roar, 哼 就 就 直接 直接 直接 直接In the past, I didn’t figure out what happened and what changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cell in the iron railing is farthest from the sound, but several iron gates and an almost enclosed environment act as accomplices. The echoes are superimposed together, although they are not as good as the sound waves they have suffered from Tim, but they are all "prisoners" who have been tortured for many days, so most of them, including Ai Wen, are like Joel and Eliza. Completely fainting, and a small number of still awake also fell into the situation of tinnitus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice-level magic "Homerz's cough", as long as you know how to use, know how to cooperate with the environment, you can create a satisfactory temporary clearance effect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And getting ready is a direct spell-free spelling to save time and seize opportunities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of casting, although the mental power is very large, but Lucien can now support the use of five or six, of course, the key moment will not be embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The sound waves produced by "Homerz's cough" are range attacks, and Lucien himself has been affected to some extent, so it is slightly dizzy. By the time he recovered, Jensen also waved his own flail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shackles are black and look very heavy, but the three gimmicks are different in appearance, and a small silver snake-like lightning jumps from time to time. One is wrapped in a burning flame, and the other is covered with a layer of succulent water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a magic weapon with lightning, flame, and acid damage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen’s eyes are red, his arms are bulging, he is wielding with force, his voice fills the room, and the air in the area seems to have been stained with red and silver. Green three colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faced Lucien, who was thoroughly attacked, completely defying the defense, as if he had to exchange his injury for the opportunity to directly hit Lucien. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of amazing power, the powerful Jensen, Lucien certainly won’t fight with him, but rely on his own speed and agility in the room. In the fight, the faint afterimages are dodging and attacking in the red, green and silver colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't delay!" Lucien calmly judged the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only because the longer you drag, the greater the impact of the magic effect of the flail, the more dangerous it is, but also the fact that Camille, Cardinal, etc. Attacked in. Fortunately, Lucien has been preparing for a quick fix, so he jumped a few steps back and retreated to the door, temporarily pulling away his distance from Jensen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red eyes seem to have lost their senses. Jensen did not retreat at all, and strode forward directly, even waving and chasing Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of flashing fluorescent powder flows out of Lucien's finger slits, still without a spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling light ball pops out, and the bright light shines like a dark cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid changes in the light and dark environment, Jensen couldn’t help but close his eyes, but he did not evade, just slowed down, and continued to wave forward, as if Not afraid of injury, as long as you can solve the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanced with his eyes closed, when Jensen was slightly slow, his feet slammed hard and turned into a shadow, bypassing the flail, from the side Glowing toward Jensen's arms, the silver dagger in his hand shines in the light, giving a cold and sharp light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen’s intuition was sharp and his elbows were closed, and even the shackles changed direction immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Lucien’s speed and agility are more than him, and he can only chase the back of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver dagger stabbed Jensen’s chest, but his firm muscles were like pieces of iron, and the black leather armor was completely Blocked outside, even the dagger began to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rage Barbarian" blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no strong defense ability, how can Jensen mad after the violent attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen looked at Lucien with bloodthirsty, and even the cockroach had touched his back, and the air seemed to be able to smell the fascinating blood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Jensen saw Lucien look up and seemed to smile at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" His keen instinct immediately noticed a great danger and the danger of letting himself die! Then the body slammed back and tried to avoid the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first spur of Jensen, Lucien’s hand illuminates the crystal cold, and three transparent ice and snow blades appear out of thin air, shooting to Jensen’s Throat, chest and waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it feels dangerous, there is no distance between the two, Jensen just leaned back, "Palmera's ice blade" hit him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen desperately provokes muscle defense, and the chest grips a cold ice blade that cuts through the black leather armor, leaving it only halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, his throat and waist have no such ability, the throat is cut open, the waist is opened, the neck is broken, and the head is swaying. To fall, the blood spurts out but freezes into frost in the air. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lucien’s body quickly smashed, and there was a silvery brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames and acides quickly burned out after the moonlight burned some red and green colors, but the beating silver and white lightning swept in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burst of pain came from the heart, Lucian almost could not keep the moonlight, the whole person was paralyzed like an electric shock can not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a bang, with Jensen and Lucien falling to the ground, the shackles were also on the ground, away from Lu Xun’s moonlight body. contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien slowed down for a few seconds, relying on the self-healing ability of the "moonlight" bloodline to recover a little, climbed up and looked at Jensen's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
