			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief applause, Douglas smiled: "Lu Sien, in the past month, including me, many of the arcane masters have confirmed the cathode. The existence of the ray, and your experiment has no problem, so we can initially assume that this is a particle smaller than the atom, as a discoverer, you have the right to name it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cathode ray paper was published in this issue of "Arcane", but it is either the highest-ranking squad or the high-level arcane sect, and there are enough channels in Lucy. After submitting the paper and reviewing it, I know that a new ray has been discovered. It can test its surname earlier than other Arcans, and try to apply it to its own magic improvement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so many Arcanists and high-level Arcanists onlookers, Lucien’s experiments will be discovered as long as there is any cheating or fraud. Therefore, the experimental results are authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It has a negative charge, and the amount of charge is very small, it is called electronic." Lucien did not change the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the name of the electronic is very good, it will be the first step in our entry into the micro world, and we are close to the real important progress."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas speaks to high-level arcians, trying to minimize the psychological impact of the atomic foundation collapse and turn it into a brilliant victory for arcane, "However, We can't be proud of it. We must calm down and think about some questions. Why do electron discharges occur in gas discharges? What unique surnames does electrons have, what are the exact masses and charges? It has nothing to do with atoms, the internal structure of atoms. What is it? The electronics can't be divided... This one question is waiting for us to explore slowly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a Douglas-style speech, Lucien heard The head swelled and finally understood why his teacher Fernando would give him the nickname "100,000 Why". It was really appropriate and he was not as good as himself - Lu Xien had already learned from Fernando’s mouth, during the miracle experiment, They just half an upstairs space planes "on the sidelines", heard his "Hundred Thousand Whys" for an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head turned slightly, and Lun’s gaze collided with Fernando. He sneered and said that he was used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Oliver smiled and interjected: "His Speaker, still give time to Evans, he is the protagonist of today."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas heard the words, hehe smiled: "I am so excited, let the young people talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Evans, are you not going to share with us your experience in the arcane, why you can not be bound by the current arcane theory, do not worry about the collapse of the cognitive world, always put forward the idea of ​​subverting the surname. Lorentha is a staunch atom, I have to spend time slowly changing her point of view, so I am very curious about your way of thinking, no, this is not forced, everyone has their own secrets, and I don’t want to share them with others. Things." Oliver smiled elegantly, neither condescending nor conservative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All questions raised by Oliver, including Roland, all the Arcans have expressed a strong interest, Fernando has become serious, want to hear what his students really want What did you think, only Hathaway continued to maintain a consistently cold and quiet attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood in front of the mirrored passage and smiled at the great arcane masters, legendary magicians, and high-level arcane masters. "In this respect, I have a personal philosophical point of view, and I hope to bring some inspiration to you and my gentlemen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In my opinion, truth A distinction must be made, and I divide them into absolute truths and relative truths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolute truth is the essence and law of the objective existence of the world, not because of any new theory The change of the proposal is the reality we are looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is limited by our level of knowledge, magical power, way of thinking, degree of exploration, physical soul By various conditions, we can only approach absolute truth and obtain relative truth under certain conditions. That is to say, relative truth is an approximation of absolute truth within a certain range, and we can solve the problems we encounter under this condition. And once this range is exceeded, the relative truth will become "#br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiling Oliver smile slowly disappeared, his expression was serious and focused, and Fernando’s red eyes were slightly picked up. I didn’t expect Lucien’s thoughts to be so special. Douglas's tall body leaned back, subconsciously looking for a comfortable sitting position, seemed to fall into thinking, Hathaway's right hand held his chin, silently, like Natasha's customary name action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So many of the theories that we overthrew and subvert are not meaningless. They are relative truths under certain conditions, but as the development of arcanes, the scope of our exploration has exceeded the conditions for their establishment, and they will appear. Errors, ridiculous, and then subverted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, in atomic theory, in common alchemy reactions and potions, as far as we are currently observing The atom is indeed the most basic substance, it is the relative truth under this condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, during the period of the ancient magical empire, why their theory is in us today It seems that there are many mistakes, but they can control their own spirits, display magic, and even become legendary magicians? That is because they are also relative truths under certain conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "With our exploration, closer to the reality of the world, the scope of truth needs to be more and more broad, and the relative truth obtained is more and more similar to absolute truth, but the world is vast, we compare It is so small, it is conceivable that for a long time, we can't get absolute truth, we can only grasp the relative truth that is more and more similar to it, and it will become a mistake at any time because the conditions are expanded and the scope is broad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, we must always hold the view that the things in our hands are only relative truths for the time being, including some absolute truths but not complete, even if We believe in it, use it, and build a cognitive world based on it, and it should be limited to certain conditions. This will better reflect the subversion of the surname."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp By the opportunity of this speech, Lucien is also sorting out and consolidating his philosophical ideas, laying the foundation for all sorts of strange things that may be faced later, and trying to subtly influence the views of the magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien also understands that it is very difficult for Sanguan once to establish a change, and the same is true of the magician’s cognitive world. This is not a philosophy. The speech can be transformed. If a person can surrender his own subconscious mind and completely control his own body and mind, using the words on earth, it belongs to the category of "holy" and "Buddha". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the future, the magician who is headshot or unable to improve because of the collapse of the cognitive world must have, because of theoretical conflicts, rebut each other, argue, hate, The assassinated magician must have, and the magician who knows the philosophical point of view but can't use it to guide his arcane and magical learning must have it. Lucien only hopes to minimize this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the speech, the small conference room was silent for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Douglas took the lead in applause: "Very good philosophical speculation, explaining the magical empire to the parliament from another angle, and the arcane at various stages of parliament Theoretical development, although we have mastered some of the truth, but we can't blindly believe, but we should ask a few more questions. Lucian, you are more mature than I imagined, not just in age, but also here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to his head. "You become an audit committee, I am completely relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see that he likes philosophy very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of absolute truth and relative truth has made many high-level arcans think thoughtfully, but they also have some doubts about this, current arcane Many of the theories and laws of the system are clearly established everywhere. They are all traces of the world, the rules summarized from the phenomena, and confirmed by the law to deduct other phenomena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief discussion, the high-level Arcanists left, they must hurry to explain the contradiction between the law of the elemental cycle and the atomism to their students and friends. And gradually spread, so that the majority of magicians can slowly change their position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, well, when your paper is officially published, I will recruit high-level questions about the Holm Crown Award." Morris is almost a word. One said to Lu Xien, the expression is very complicated, and the relief is a thick "hate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no opinion." Lucien couldn't bear to stimulate him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris nodded heavily and saw that Lavendi had stepped out of the small meeting room, which was “smile”: “In fact, the miracle experiment has enough possibilities to help You won the Immortal Throne Award, it seems that there is no need to take another ring, anyway, there is electronics, huh, I am joking, you don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
