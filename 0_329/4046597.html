			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexel Palace, the peripheral area where the House of Lords is located, Richard has been waiting here with hundreds of major supporters of religious reform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two gods descended in the sky and attacked each other, these cardinal and bishops looked confused and confused, and whispered in the mouth. Words that do not have the same meaning but are similar to each other: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is heresy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always a heresy? Then why can the heresy be used by God?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord, are you testing us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, the supreme god of the Pope, no doubt It confirms the identity of the spokesperson of the god of truth, and has deterred all the powerful enemies including the gods in the past millennium. It is the most solid confidence in the hearts of the clergy, even if the bishops of the northern heresy mentioned this issue. At the same time, there will be unsuccessful silences, no longer eloquent, although the Pope has a "god" that is close to the power of the gods in a short time, Wounded and can repel "Silver God" and "Lord of Hell," "God drop technique" than up, like the Kings angel and angels difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, Thrall’s saint, the rebel sect of the Pope, also used the “God of the Gods”, does that mean that this is not the Lord’s A special gift, but an ordinary magic that can be mastered through exploration? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sarder is also given the Lord’s grace, “God is falling”, who is his spokesperson on earth? Who is the heresy when the two gods of the gods destroy each other with the "God Drop"? Why does the Lord want to create such a scene? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of emotions such as confusion, vacillation, confusion, etc. reverberate in their hearts. It seems that carelessness will shake the faith and be swallowed up by the Holy Light. In that case, the Magic Council is sure The Pope and Thrall will be awarded the “Special Contribution Award” in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the destruction of the cleric faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s question was heard in the mind of the road:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does God love the world, but love the shepherd more? God loves the world, but is not willing to communicate directly with everyone's heart? When praying, at home and in the church, the sense of the gods is different. Get the magical gift, Must be guided by clergy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is the spokesperson of God, why have you repeatedly explained the wrong Holy Scriptures? Amend the "Teach of the Holy Scriptures?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Pope and the Church are both obstructed by the desire of the individual to be between the believer and the God, regardless of whether or not they can receive God. The technique should be equally equal in the presence of the Lord..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when, the way he would think of these words in the way of reading the Holy Scriptures Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moderate cleric first looked at him with a confused and helpless look. He seemed to be seeking the true meaning of the gods, listening and listening. They seem to understand something, and some people are keenly connected to Richard's program of propaganda - returning the right to interpret the Holy Scripture to every believer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be the main test of our purpose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the Lord really wants The heavens and the earth to be created! No matter the men, women and children, rich and poor, as long as the soul is pious, everyone can get a redemptive paradise on earth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their expressions change They were peaceful and compassionate, their eyes were full of steadiness and fanaticism. At the end, all of them shouted loudly with Richard:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who told the believers 'Faith, Faith,' but the clergy who have shunned the faith to go away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those who say to the believers that 'God loves the world, God loves the world' However, it is intended to monopolize the priests who are close to the spiritual path, and say goodbye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be no artificial obstacles between believers and the Lord, only faith and Match what the faith does!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul wraps are completely lost. Richard has a feeling of being closer to the Lord and more joyful. The magical skills of the thick and thin hair finally crossed the door and were promoted to the ninth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around him, there are many clergymen who have upgraded one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the gift of the Lord, and this is His joy to our choice." Richard voice said in an ethereal voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal who has also improved the level of one can’t conceal a smile: “Bishop Richard, wait until your religious reform program is realized, maybe you Can become a pastor of the Holy Spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We pay not for reward, but for faithfulness." Richard waved his hand gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw Natasha, a silver-gray armor, wearing a golden crown with many gems, and the aftermath of the legendary war outside caused Nike from time to time. Under the dangerous environment of the enchantment of the ceremonial enchantment, the sword was held with a long sword, and the British martial arts strode over and over, full of the majesty of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, Natasha nodded lightly and painted a cross on his chest: "The Lord is always in our hearts."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple long hair she rolled up swayed up and down with her head, which made people worry that the crown would fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is forever." Richard understood Natasha's support and led the clergy to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not say anything, the nobles in the House of Nobles should have seen the transformation of these clergy, and their faith will certainly be shaken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Lords, the Duke of James, the Duke of Russell, the Earl of Pine, and other people looked at the sky as if they were gray, the light of the ocean, the scent of destruction, It is not as good as the shock brought by the words "God descending to God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are aristocrats who are biased towards the parliament, after hundreds of years of edification, they have been passed down from generation to generation, and the faith has been integrated into their blood, spirit and will. The God of Truth is undoubtedly the only true God, except that He creates everything, is inclusive, and does not discriminate against normal magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, this contradictory scene makes their faith violently shaken, perhaps the Lord is as high as the magician described, given according to certain rules The magical technique maintains the world's operation and does not care about other things at all. Even if the church is divided, even if "God is down to God", it is just a farce! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation of Richard and other clergy outside seems to give them another possibility to explain this behavior, the mood gradually precipitates, and more eyes A bit of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think Sarder can use God's Falling..." The Duke of James looked at his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russell smiled and replied: "The Pope may not have thought of it, so he has to use God to stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no extra word, no other analysis, only a plain two-word answer, everything is in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rex, Sorenfinch and other conservative aristocrats are more chaotic, as if they do not know what the Lord is, what is the Pope, what is the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of their muttering words is similar to that of the previous moderate clerics, full of confusion and sluggishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Natasha walked in, and behind the scenes followed Camille, this is the first time she wore the silver-gray "Holm Kay", Wearing the Holm crown to enter the noble house, thick and beautiful purple eyebrows, bright and firm silver-purple eyes, high nose, tight lips, slightly stiff outlines, outline a beautiful In addition to the scene, with the body armor, the golden crown complement each other, let the knight's heroic, the king's majesty, unreservedly revealed, so that the nobles seem to find the backbone, the mood is gradually stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Sword of Truth" held by her right hand made the pupils of Rex, Sorenfin, James and other nobles shrink slightly, and Her Majesty concealed her strength. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal sneakers squeaked on the wooden platform, Natasha ignored the horror of magic and magical flying outside, and the voice was low: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Start an emergency aristocratic meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the Pope and Thrall, you have made the work of persuasion a little more than the advance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strange magic item on the stage that runs on the current, recording Natasha’s voice, and then letting the sound enter a metal pipeline. Spreading out in the "land of heaven", because the pre-layed telephone line itself is connected to the city and beyond, and such transmission is not extraordinary power, it has withdrawn from the "land of heaven" and passed into the manor on the outskirts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternate magician squad in the manor, quickly relayed the "live voice" of this aristocratic conference to the Kingdom of Camelot, the Kingdom of Burrian, through the artificial planet. Aristocratic House of the Principality of Calais and the Coastal Corridor of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the start of the legendary battle, all quickly flew into the air and seized Air supremacy, if not the limit of the "land of heaven", they will fly to the height of 10,000 meters like Benedict II and Thrad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the "God Drop" to the "God Drop" breath from the sky, penetrated the barrier of the "land of heaven", St. Mermo It was unusually surprised and confused, but it was followed by heavy pressure. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salde is a traitor? Will he drop the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope Burning the rest of your life uses the gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Salde is really hot and deliberately confronts the Pope at high altitude. This is to shake the foundation of the church! Even if he is dead, the church will fall into the mud."<br /><br />&nbsp; Of course, Melmos also knows that there is another purpose for Thrad to fly to the sky, that is, the triggering medium that prevents him from falling down, the city of Rentatt and the heavens on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he used the "land of heaven" to isolate the legendary battle, in addition to strengthening the strength of the church cardinal members, weakening the magicians, but also protecting the tower The meaning of the special city believers, otherwise, in the uncontrolled battle, the entire Rantart has been destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods in the sky confronted as if they had distorted space and time, and there was an abnormal solidification. Pope Benedict II and Thrall briefly lost their sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos is ready for the Pope’s inability to draw his hand for a certain period of time, suppressing the storm’s dominance, and glance at the entire battlefield:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas took advantage of the endless stream of magic in the confrontation with the King of Angels, even the magic of the nine rings, eight rings, and one ring, used in his hands, The effect is not inferior to the ordinary legendary magic, but also faster and easier, but the king of angels with the "guardian of the gods" Mecan Tron is very sturdy, so that the arcane emperor can not free his hands, nor can he prepare for more powerful Legendary magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri gradually became familiar with the strength of the legendary peak and began to suppress the two saints. Oliver and Helen were weakened by the "land of heaven" and they were on their own side. In the case of the two saints gaining, they can still fight into a tie, and the strength of the Arcane Master is stronger than that of the saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in other places, the lower the strength, the more the "the heavenly kingdom" is suppressed, the church's Holy Spirit priests and holy knights gradually gain the upper hand, especially "star Yao Zhiguang was left and right under the siege of Estila and Azzaro. It was not killed by legendary items and many strange magics, but it seems that his degraded ending will not take long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm in front of Fernando is also suppressed by himself. Although he can't solve him in a short time, he has the ability to empty the hand to protect the super large transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the battle is still on his own side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of these, Melmos’s gaze looks at the super-large transmission array below, as long as the follow-up two Saints or third-order epic knights do not need With more tuition, you can begin to effectively kill the evil magicians, and once this happens, the seven epic knights on the Stormwind Strait should know how to choose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
