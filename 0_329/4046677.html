			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early July 825, the temperature burned like a fire. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 31st floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, successfully passed the assessment and entered Honoré of Holt School of Magic with a few students to look at it with great interest. The sky radio station in the first district is quite sorry: "It is a pity that the radio station is broadcast live at night. The school will be closed at 6 o'clock in the evening and will not be able to stay. Otherwise, it will be able to find Miss Lark and Miss Nightingale. Their voices are so good. It must be very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for using the remaining 31st floor of the Allinge Magic Tower as the teaching area of ​​the Holt School of Magic is Because there are various high-level laboratories in the Magic Tower, they can be used directly, without having to re-build the materials, and the students' accommodation areas are in other places in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can apply for a night magic experiment." Another student, Clark, said with a funny voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onorre frowned and said: "Because I started learning for two months, many arcane and magical classes are still playing the foundation. How can I apply for night magic experiments? Content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holt School of Magic began in early May, with an optional course, graduated from two to five years, with a New Year holiday and no summer vacation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the matrix mechanics of Lord Evans, I am still in a state of utter disappointment, mastered the matrix, and also grasped how to calculate, but why In this way, why does it work so completely that it is like doing a purely mathematical work, and if you don't understand the meaning of the arcane behind it, the whole theory will be incomprehensible to me, difficult to master, and often dizzy." Clarke said bitterly, the matrix mechanics are so cold that they are inaccessible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honoré shook his head and tried to use jokes to resolve the emotion: "Is it like the words of Lord Evans, every word, Every calculation, you understand, but you don't understand anything after you are connected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost like this, the same is true for special relativity, premise and I can understand the logical derivation, the specific temporal and spatial relationship, and how to apply it to analyze magic. I am very upset.” Clark sighed. As for general relativity, there is only a general introduction, no specific course. In the entire Magic Council, there are no more than ten generalized theory of relativity. I am afraid that all the teachers in the college are not qualified for this course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onorre spread his hands and was about to talk. He suddenly found that the teacher of the college’s “Department of Academic Affairs” stood out from the magic lift and stood there in the hands. Holding a journal of Arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enersto teacher?" Honoré screamed strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, Ernesto’s "Arcane" fell to the ground, and there were fears and fears in his eyes that looked at Honoré and Clark. Person: "No class?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this week's course is over, Teacher Ernesto is this period of "Arcane" ?? Honoré asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rule at the Holt School of Magic. Whether you can read "Arcane", "Magic" and "Nature", you must read the latest and most The frontiers of arcane and magic research, so as not to be abandoned by the times, and these three journals are ordered by the college, free of charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enesto looks like the devil looking at the "Arcane" on the ground, hesitatingly said: "This is the "Arcane" of this period, Don't believe the above, it's best to experiment with yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The theory of subversion of surname? Experiment?" Honoré also stared at the ground with his eyes wide open. "Arcane", the headshot frenzy of the light quantum gave him a few deep impressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Electron Diffraction Experiment with Single Crystal"..." Clarke read the title of "Arcane" to spread the page, and the doubts on his face are puzzled. , "Electronic? Diffraction? How can these two things be linked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the secret preparations to explore the world of the dead, Lucien's electron diffraction The experiment was postponed for another two months and was submitted to the Arcane Review Board after departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onore couldn’t restrain the "Arcane" and muttered to himself: "Clark, remember the previous "Arcane"? ? The highest panel of judges discussed the period of Mr. Dieppe's paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honoré was nervous and afraid to read the paper, saw the material preparation of the experiment, saw the specific experimental process, and saw the final experimental pattern, the familiar and classic diffraction pattern! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, it is true, the electronic has a fluctuating surname..." Honoré’s eyes seem to have lost their focal length, and the subconsciously said the feelings in their hearts. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there was a speech and an example of Lucien’s thoughts on breaking the fog of thinking, let him initially accept that the electronic is an unknown thing that has not really been explored, and blurted out. It is electronic that has a fluctuating surname, not an electron is a wave. This is not a disorder of worldview, and it is suspected of an objective surname and surname of the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark shook his head violently: "It must be verified by experiments and must be verified by experiments!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enesto He also nodded hard and took several students to the high-level magic laboratory to prepare experimental materials according to the method of Lord Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, until the dreamy image appeared in their eyes, Ernesto sat in a chair and slammed his head A very painful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Honoré startled, suspecting that Ernesto’s head would burst open and red and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Ernesto gradually returned to normal and couldn’t understand the world in front of him: “There are particle surnames and fluctuating surnames, that’s true. What about the world? I feel that I don’t understand anything I’ve been familiar with at the moment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honoré is afraid that he will continue to struggle and quickly shift the topic: “Arcane” There is a joint paper by Lord Evans and several students, and the papers on matrix mechanics re-processed with the classic mathematical tools of the past seem to be much simpler and cleaner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It can be refreshed and simple, and it can't be understood. It can't be mastered. If you don't understand the meaning of the arcane behind these mathematical calculations, it will still resemble the 'matrix maze' that can't go out." Clark looked at the journal in his hand, and his brow was deep. Wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly quietly silenced, Honoré also recalled the electronic surname, which showed the undisputed particle surname and presented Familiar and shocking diffraction patterns, according to Dieppe's paper, not only electrons should be like this, but also protons and neutrons. The elements, materials, and worlds composed of them also have two major names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the alchemy platform, chairs, floor tiles, magic crystal lights that can be touched in front of the eyes, Honoré also shook his head: "I don't know the real world." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark has a sentence: "There is a change to the Arcane textbook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Onnoreton laughed, remembered the scene that he met when he was in the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools" in April. The new alchemy textbook that was confirmed in the morning had to be changed at the end of the noon exam. After two months of class, the textbook has to be changed:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a crazy era, but also a wonderful time..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lab of his own magic tower, Dieppe also looked at the diffraction pattern a little unbelievably, giving the same sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of completing the experiment, he felt the "real world feedback" and improved his cognitive world, but he was very puzzled: "Why It’s much less than the expected feedback? Did Evans, who completed the diffraction experiment, account for the vast majority?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can only explain this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he didn’t know was that Lucien was rushing to experiment in order to reverse the changes in the cognitive world, and did not complete the theoretical derivation. The power of feedback from the next point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray background color, the red coat of the Rhine is unusually eye-catching, But Lucian did not care. The Temple of the Dead is full of danger everywhere, and the Rhine has always been mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I almost started to do it, but I feel the source of my residual blood in your body." Rhein said with a faint smile, elegant manners, unlike It is a dangerous area deep in the realm of the dead, but it is like preparing to attend a concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
