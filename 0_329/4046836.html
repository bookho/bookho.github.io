			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The more you go to the depths of the ocean, the more you will feel confused, even though there is actually no fog..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The sun shining from the sky is pale and dull, making the surrounding faintly awkward, as if you are in another world, and you can’t communicate with the outside..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Trying to go back and look for the starting point of this anomaly, but it can't be found. It seems to be a tiny, gradual process of change, from quantitative to qualitative, difficult Accurately define..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No matter how it is positioned according to the sun, stars or the surrounding environment, going to the end will always return to somewhere before. This is very different from the flight of the ground to the universe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the atomic universe, Lucien looked at the information in his hands, this is a generation of magic. It is a precious asset to explore the experience of the eternal depth of the ocean, just like a bit. Odd magician, Dafa under the tutelage of the ground rather than attempt to track the flight as a space jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to their point of view, starting from a certain height, the sky is like a deep fog, giving people the feeling of being foggy, and because of the existence of its own atmosphere, this The feeling is more illusory and difficult to distinguish. Therefore, flying from the ground to the scheduled orbit will be more difficult than normal. Even if the legend prefers to choose space to jump, but in any case, this flight will not be rotated in place, as long as the positioning according to the stars, Will fly out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to limitations of external and internal conditions, legendary magicians such as Douglas are currently unable to quantitatively give a demarcation point for this feeling. To figure out exactly what height it started, the observation of the ground was completely immersed in the "fog", and naturally there is no way to study the mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this "finishing the sun" failed, Douglas's focus was on this, thinking hard, trying to find a way to locate the demarcation point, the idea seems to hit with artificial Intelligent alchemy items, in order to eliminate all subjective interference, so they have a lot of support for Heidi's research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha wore silver-gray full-body armor, carrying the sword of truth, and came in with excitement: "When are we going?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of Rentait is on the right track, the blood of the knight in her veins is boiling and calling for fighting. If Lucien is not out, she is ready to go alone. The abyss gap adventures in the Rupp Forest, the mad-like chaotic demon is more suitable as a battle choice, because they are not so afraid of death after the madness - the bloody plain has been occupied by another demon king of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien’s exploration of the eternal depth of the ocean does require a companion to concentrate on experimenting, recording data, and exploring the environment. In addition, some At the time, the epic knight's intuition is better than the legendary magician, especially when the body changes slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and put down the information in his hand: "It seems that there is always something that delays you, not me, when I can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at the end of April 828, Lucien has repeatedly read the information about the depths of the endless ocean in order to wait for Natasha to handle the current affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed twice and said, "As a queen, how can I say go and go, and just hit Rantat?" The most troublesome stage of the expansion, so it was delayed for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she did not wait for Lucien to answer, "Hammer" waved: "Depart! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and shook his head, watching her two long legs fly fast, her back straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is pure and innocent, the sea is full of tumbling Gloomy dark blue, wide and wide on all sides, except blue, nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind, unpredictablely blowing, only the undulating sea surface indicates its existence, suddenly, invisible wind, the two figures are slowly protruding, One wearing a black double-breasted long dress, wearing a top hat, holding a silver-colored pocket watch in his hand, seems to be watching the "time of the feast", and the other is a beautiful lady with purple long hair flying with the wind. The silver-gray armor made her add a little cold and hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha understands the idea of ​​Lucien. Since she wants to explore the secrets of the endless ocean, it must not be transmitted directly to the neighborhood. Who knows if it has already passed the place where the strangeness begins to creep out, so the best way is to Farther away, a little closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hasn’t yet nodded, Lucian once again said: “Remember to master the changes in the body and not let go of any minor abnormal changes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." She nodded gently, her face smiled, like a cat stole, "can be used in your important experiments." , I am really, subject, pet, if, shocked..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiom "being flattered" has been transformed into a linguistic form by Lucien, but in order to accurately express Meaning, the sentence structure is quite complicated, and the length is amazing. Natasha, who has only heard it once again, inevitably feels a mouthful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing her answer, Lucien was laughing at the moment, and it seems that she is stunned by her title of "Laboratory Destroyer." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is not a lab." How can Lucien let go of the opportunity to tune Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at Lucien with a smile and smiled: "I will not cooperate with your 'experiment' after careful, anyway, I am an experimental destroyer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien coughed and didn't know when the "experiment" would succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two flew slowly over the sea, letting a sea creature that only swam through the sky look strangely in the air, how can someone fly more than us? slow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flight lasted for two days. Because of Lucian magic, there is no sea creature and fierce bird that is good at "jumping". disturb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Natasha suddenly stopped, looking up at the silver moon and the sparse stars in a strange way, not quite sure: "It seems to be heavy A little?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle smile on Lucien’s face immediately converges, taking a small and exquisite metal hut directly from the storage bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical fluctuations occurred, the metal lodge became bigger and bigger, and it was turned into a relatively well-equipped laboratory in mid-air, while Lucien’s hands stretched out and the fingers flew. Playing the piano like a different magical array and alchemy instrument, determine the important parameters such as gravity, humidity, wind level, temperature, and star position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha holds a long sword and stands out from the air, guarding the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time passed by, the quiet night only the sound of the undercurrent, Natasha looked around the circle and fell on the face of Lucien On the other hand, because of the position of the station, she can only see the side face of Lucien. The handsome face that is familiar with the extreme is not a habitual smile at this time. There is no gaze to himself, only the expression of full concentration. And deep eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Natasha not only does not feel bored and lonely, but has a quiet and warm feeling, while looking at Lucien’s focused side face. There was a smile on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound of the water below sounded, and a huge black shadow appeared on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哗啦啦, a tens of meters long sea monster came out, black pressure like a hill, it looks like a freshwater crocodile, but it is like that The sheer size, the weirdness, the scales flashing mottled colors under the silver moon, the atmosphere is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sea monster that rules the nearby waters, it feels the invasion of threatening creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha turned her head, her eyes twitched slightly, and the silver-purple smudged pupil seemed to have a silver-gray sword shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea monster suddenly solidified in the air, then turned around and dive, seemingly frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although they are sea monsters, they are more like monsters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's instinctively sharp." Lucian smiled into the ears of Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
