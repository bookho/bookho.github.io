			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so coincidental? Downey only felt inexplicable surprises and fears like a big hand, holding his heart tightly, causing difficulty breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, too, have a nightmare?" he asked anxiously, even if he tried to keep the sound steady and normal, after exporting, it was still like The smoke of the night is constantly drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Carl adjusted his breath first, answered Downey’s question, and then his beautiful silver-purple eyes looked around Sami. At a glance, it was quite majestic. "I dreamed that Sami was possessed by her own ghost, lost consciousness, and went to the center of the 'Nongmian Cemetery', and I and Downey and Jones followed him in order to find the reason..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the same!" Carl's words have not been finished yet, Downey and Jones blurted out at the same time, their expressions and eyes were terrified, and several people in the bedroom actually did it. The same nightmare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too strange? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there really a ghost in the bedroom, which affects everyone? Or a curse in the collective? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey swallowed hard, the cold sweat on his forehead gathered, gliding across his face, feeling the fear and fear that had never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all the same? Follow Sami into the tomb and see the 'original body' and find something sealed under it?" Carl's tail is a bit Pulling high seems to be equally astonished and scared, but it is fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones’s tone is stunned: “Well, when we snarled through the tomb, the mummy, the dragon lich, the ghost, and other undead creatures still turned a blind eye to us. It was because we were dreaming. ... I said. It is impossible for everyone to have a 'hidden' talent like me, but, but why I will be noticed, affecting, and having the same dreams as you..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the horror, he kept muttering to himself. He didn’t seem to believe that he would be involved in this strange thing without his sense of existence. At this time, he really Showing the heart of a 17-year-old boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you listen. Downey is more certain. Everyone really did the same nightmare, and it was a nightmare of different perspectives, or it can be said that he and others are being manipulated to complete an opera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this strange thing happens! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sami, what are you dreaming of?" Carl jumped out of bed. Looking at Sami with a gaze. He is wearing a thin shirt. The back is straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami sitting on the bed, the ghost behind it seems to have lost its vitality, lazily sloshing. He has not spoken, and seems to be immersed in a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing Carl’s question, Sami shuddered and all the faint memories on his face turned into fear: “I, I dreamed that I was What is summoning, walking uncontrollably ahead, all the way, dark and silent, as if in the legendary final destination, later, later, the huge body composed of countless intelligent creatures appeared, let me wake up, I feel like I have entered a dreamlike world, struggling to wake up, but I can't wake up until I really feel the death..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His voice is like a nightmare, the organization is not clear enough, but enough Carl and Downey and others understand that Sami has done the same nightmare! Only he is standing at his own point of view, his eyes are closed and he is felt by the perspective of the ghost possession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Karl, this thing is so weird, I don’t think we can solve it at all. We will report to the college at dawn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Jones and Sami immediately nodded, although they have their own talents, and they are inevitably a little proud, but after all, they are still underage children, even the strength of the official magician is not, suddenly encountered This kind of thing that completely surpasses the imagination, will certainly be confused, looking for objects that can be relied upon, and there is no doubt that the college with many high-level magicians and even teachers is their inner pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Karl is asked is that Downey has noticed from his dream that he has the same curiosity and exploration as a cat, and may even encourage himself. Investigate secretly, so first use the way of asking to dispel his eagerness, and he has a deep background, may be able to see something, give valuable advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? The experiment of the college?" The three surprised voices sounded one after another, and the shock and unbelief was overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said that in case, this possibility cannot be ruled out. Maybe the tutor in the college is studying the relationship between soul and dream? This is based on ordinary The dreams of the brain structure seem to be different. If this is a secret experiment that is unwilling to be known by other arcans, we rush to report to the college, maybe it will be..." Carl made a cut throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie was shocked and shivered: "It’s just possible..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His voice is getting lower because he found it really possible! This is Heidele's lock and "Tower of Life". Whoever wants to secretly influence himself and others, it is difficult to escape the induction, unless unless the induction will not be processed...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire bedroom suddenly became extremely quiet, only the fine breathing sounds indicate that there is still a living thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are just magic apprentices..." Sami frowned, his hands clasping the velvet quilt, and the blue veins of his hands bulged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones sat at the foot of the bed like a ghost, seemingly trying to cover up his sense of existence: "Don’t scare yourself, if it’s the secret experiment of the college, what do we do? Can't escape, so it's better to gamble? I don't want to have a nightmare every day, waiting for the end of the day, and hope that the people behind the scenes are not malicious! I don't want!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a secret journalist career for nearly two years, and he can still think rationally, but when it comes to the latter, it also shows a kind of hysteria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is doing the same nightmare... This level of strength is not something we can secretly investigate..." Downey could barely keep calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car smiled unexpectedly, in the dark bedroom, like a starlight, the water lotus bloomed: "I know, I mean, don't Anxious to report to the college, I have secret channels to contact the outside world, I will pass this out. Ask the professionals to analyze the reasons and give suggestions. After all, there are several ways to make several people have a nightmare at the same time. We have no What is the ability to judge, after which we make a decision whether to wait for rescue or report to the college.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This only needs to wait a day, it should not be too Great danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret channels? professional? Downey suddenly remembered Carl's deep background, and suddenly saw the dawn in the dark, slightly excited: "Really? Then please!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the capacity of Carl. It should not be difficult to deal with such a sneaky behind-the-scenes conspiracy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he really has the power of terror to the extreme. Why do you hide in the shadows? I have already stood up and overthrew the parliament and did what I wanted to do! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones and Sami were equally excited, watching Carl together, until Karl gently beheaded. They quietly sighed. One is more retracted into the corner. An eyelid began to look around and fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would encourage us to investigate and explore ourselves..." Downey said relaxed, casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl snorted: "I am like a person who is so reckless and does not know what to prioritize?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; like! Downey, Sami, and Jones all concealed in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a keen sense of inheritance from my parents. When I feel that things are not something I can solve. I will find someone to help." Calvary looked at the truth. "When it's dawn, I will pass it out and listen to Mr. Felipe's open class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have forgotten the fear and fear before , and become "carefree" again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, Mr. Felipe’s open class, I have to hurry and fill my sleep." Sami nodded, a very eager sleep, There is no feeling of nightmares at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Felipe’s expertise is not a ghost direction, he is the most well-known necromancer in the last two or three decades, so Sami also admires him. I want to listen to his open class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
