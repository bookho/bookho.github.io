			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktav opened his mouth, just about to speak, the soft light of the body suddenly lit up, swallowing his whole person together with the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light group turned into a little spot, all the traces that Octave had existed here were erased, just like the previous night watchman The same as Germany. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Richard frowned and looked at Octave’s death but could not stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put his hands in the black long trench coat pocket, dignified: "The 'angels' on their body is not only a 'gift' to enhance strength in a short time. It is also a 'poison' that cannot be reversed at a critical moment. This should be to prevent them from being captured by the enemy and tortured the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand punches the olta After the husband, Lucien didn't think there was anything, but on the other side, Aphrodite teased Lund's battle but suddenly changed. Lund got the power of "angels coming" and instantly gained the upper hand, if not Lucy. When the end of this is fast, prompt help, I am afraid that Lund has escaped, but even so, in the end failed to catch Lund, watching him being swallowed up by the "angel power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien did not attempt to move and wake Oktaf, bring him back to Allinge to interrogate, but directly swear "angel power "The opportunity to be temporarily suppressed by the mysterious existence of the silver moon and the dead spirit world, through the dream of acquiring intelligence, otherwise this kind of thing, Lucien is more willing to ask the "curse of the eye" Atlante or "King of the Nightmare" Stanis helps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richarde shook his head unacceptably: "How can the Lord's darling use this method for the Lord's servant?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly the same as the devils and demons who have done to their worshippers, and can prevent the eight-level cardinal from being lifted, obviously not the average angel can do - - The pure light just made him have no doubt about the source of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An angel is only a darling and messenger of God, but they do not necessarily represent God, just like the fallen pope in Octathon can use God. Falling, this may be the test of the god of truth." Lucian, Richard, a little confused opportunity, deliberately confused the logic and continued to guide him to think in the direction he wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common blue eyes of Richard's Holm Kingdom look at the ground where Oktaf disappeared, muttering to himself: "That name" Is the prophet 'really the 'king of angels' coming? Is it really possible to complete the religious reforms through the Pope and the Cardinal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least from Octa The subconscious mind of the husband, he believes through some things that it is indeed the 'king of angels' coming." Lu Xien was a bit confused, initially heard in the dream that Octaph said the name of "great prophet" I thought that it was the "Lord of Hell". This old friend appeared again, and his heart was more certain of his relationship with Sarde, but Octave’s unquestioned attitude toward the prophet made Lucien confuse, at least The Lord of Hell itself is unable to steal the power of the God of truth, but must pass the high-ranking devotees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "King of Angels" is the legendary Heaven Mountain, second only to the god of truth and has a record of the advent, although it may only have the strength of the legendary peak, It is one layer worse than the Lord of Hell, but it is not directly blinded by Him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the great prophet is just a shackle from the Lord of Hell, or is it another planner, like Sald? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued to think about these things while continuing to say: "And, Bishop Richard, your plan of religious reform advocates the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures The right is returned to the devout believers. Then why must we rely on the top-down reforms of the Pope and the Cardinal? You should mobilize the believers, rely on the believers, and use their mighty powers to smash the obstacles that block the channels of faith. Perhaps it is the purpose of the test of the God of truth, which may be why He does not prevent the division of the church from the north to the south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard turned his head and looked at it Lu Xien, he never thought from this angle why the church was able to obtain magical skills in the split between the north and the south. When he thought about it, he shook his head: "The Pope and the Cardinal Mission have mastered the extraordinary power of the Lord. With the unpowered believers, the reforms have no effect, depending on the middle and lower clerics, unless the Lord can take back the magic of them and give each believer power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Lucien himself has no god-like beliefs, and naturally cannot understand Richard's devout bishop. Therefore, he is accustomed to using his rights, fame and fortune, and temptation in the position of Heaven Mountain after his death. In his view, there is no driver of interest. The idea of ​​Richard Reform is hard to stick to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard listened to Lucian’s words, and the slightly blue eyes slammed: “Yes, rely on the believers, mobilize the believers, they are The foundation of the existence of Heaven Mountain is the object of the Lord's true grace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wiped the cold sweat, and this half-hanger is too much Things can't imagine what the religious reform program and road map that Richard finally came up with would look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No delays, fearing that the fall of Octave and Lund will cause the "great prophet" to be alert, allowing Richard to fully open the divine array, Lucien and Affris left the "Redemption Church." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris grief walked inexplicably by Lucien, the translucent amber eyes were full of sorrow, and kept whispering in his mouth: "My loot, my spoils..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lund was swallowed up by the Holy Light, and there was nothing left in it, and Oktaf’s valuable thing Most of them were destroyed under the "Elemental Order" of Lucian, so Affris was not caught in a little treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and patted it: "The ultimate destruction of the ball" I left this scroll, the remains of Octave are yours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphras's ear moved, and immediately turned around and rushed to Lucien's side, his tongue sticking out, and he touched Lucien's hand intimately: "The boss , sign me another hundred years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of generous, published papers often win awards, where are such generous good partners to find? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris wants to shut up Lucien to his home and urge him to write a thesis every day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien was stunned by this shameless crystal dragon, and after throwing those items to it, he quickly pulled back his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite opened the storage bag that Lu Xien temporarily used to hold these items, and lowered his eyes to pour the treasure in his palm, using his tongue It seems that this way you can leave your own brand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end, Averys looked at the treasures with a sigh of relief and asked with a courtesy: "Lu Xien, I don’t think you have a dream." Such a deep understanding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the study, but a large part of it was just too far-fetched." Lucien did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphras looked strangely at Lucien: "You are not afraid to come to the wrong conclusion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no problems at a few key points. Octave is too impressed with this. The reaction can be solved almost without skill in the dream. As for the others, it is wrong to say wrong, his What is the relationship between my mental condition and me? Am I still responsible for his mental health?" Lucien laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris did not take this problem anymore, continued to count the lovely treasures, and said with an angry voice: "Lu Xien, they actually said that I am your magic pet. Too much, we are obviously partners!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, partner." Lucien answered casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affris curiously asked: "For the magician, the magic pet is not more important, I see that except for a few wizards, there are magic pets. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only learns its own "interested" theory, and has no idea about the "magic pet" that may share its treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, the magic pet is an extension of the magician's body, the eyes and ears of the magician..." Lucien probably talked about the role of the magic pet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking, Averys didn’t speak, Lucien looked at it strangely and saw it looking brightly and brightly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aphrodite slammed into Lucien’s side, glaring at his left hand:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
