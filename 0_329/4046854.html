			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark mist shrouded the castle that seemed to be in the period of the ancient magical empire, and a burst of heart-rending beasts screamed from inside, and there was a screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any place, a similar situation will certainly create a horror story, scaring children to cry at night, attracting church clergy or magic parliament to fight The cleanup of the Master Division also attracts a group of adventurers to explore, but in the dark mountains, this situation abounds, and there may be more fearful castles than anywhere else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gorgeously decorated room with thick carpets from the southern desert of the Gusta Empire, with a piece of art with a history of vicissitudes The product, which is filled with floor-to-ceiling windows that have only recently emerged in the mountains for hundreds of years, is so rich in aristocratic atmosphere. It is not very harmonious. There is a man and a woman lying on the carpet. They are dressed in easy-to-operate locks and hold the rogue on their hands. A long sword with a blue "water wave" and a red "flame". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a 30-year-old man in a classical robe standing in front of him, his body and face are extremely thin, but his head is bigger than ordinary people. A circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a smile on his lips, and it looked gloomy under the dark mist outside, his eyes faintly burning, greedily looking back and forth at the man and woman. It seems that I can't restrain my inner desires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s so delicious whether it’s the heart or the flesh. This harvest really surprises me...” The man squats, his skinny right hand Stretching out, touching and stroking the lady's good face and the man's hard face is like enjoying two pieces of art that make him excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of touch made the two sleeping people react, and the eyes turned around under the eyes, as if they would wake up immediately, but the big man did not have any alert. Still continue to have a one-inch skin and an inch of skin to find the rhythm of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between half-dream and half-awake, Sharon felt that there was something cold and slippery on his face and walked up, like a creepy snake, which made him very disgusted. She was awakened by this creature and slammed her eyes open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a golden ceiling with a crystal chandelier and a familiar face, which is so close to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Buffalo, you... my strength!" Sharon subconsciously shouted out the other's name, but halfway through, she suddenly found her blood. The power cannot be mobilized, and the blood power that has been painstakingly upgraded to the rank of the great knight has disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fern, what are you doing!" The man next to Sharon awake for a few seconds, so he found Fain's anomaly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fern Haha laughed: "Constance, what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is it what you brought us? Why?" Sharon was also a great knight who fought a lot of battles. He quickly resisted panic and found that he could not mobilize his blood power because his hands and feet were wearing imprisoned bracelets and feet. chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her question is still full of horror. She and Constance knew Fern from childhood, took risks together, grew up together, and were promoted to knights. I got the title of the kingdom, no stranger to the dark mountains, and often came to the edge to find rare materials. This time, Fern claimed that he found a relic in a separate adventure. There should be many good things in it, so Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the castle is not as simple as Fern’s, the three of them have been attacked by many powerful dark creatures, and after a bloody battle, they encounter a strange fog. After waking up, I found that Fain became so strange after I woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fern, he has been my slave for a long time." "Fern" smiled madly, suddenly, his eyes bulged, it seemed to be It will explode, and then, in his nostrils, in his mouth, in his ears, a octopus-like tentacle grows and his skin becomes scarlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Win the devil!" Constance shouted a little desperately, this monster is good at controlling the mind, good at many related spells, falling into his hands, absolutely It is better to die than to die. Maybe afterwards, I will be the slave of the other party in the case of retaining most of my memory and personality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I take your brains away and transform my slaves, my injuries are basically restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dark fog, with this Discourse, Fain’s expression has an indescribable embarrassment, so Sharon’s determined knight can’t help but shudder, which is more terrible than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacles of the "feathers" next to the "Fern" head spread toward Sharon and Constant, aiming at their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon and Constant could not use the blood power, only the hands supported the body to recede, retreating, their backs against the cold wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless, the reason why I don’t use mind control to make you obedient, is to appreciate your fearful and frightened performance.” "Fern" proudly Laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Knight and the ordinary knight are actually not much different, but because their blood is often related to the devil, the devil or the demon, it will affect their character. And the state of mind, if the will is not strong enough, it is likely to be unable to control its own blood and become a veritable "devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling that the cold and greasy tentacles have touched their faces, no matter how strong the will will not stop Sharon from desperate and horrified shouting:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Useless, here is the depths of the dark mountains, inside my castle In addition to my slaves, there is no life, you shout loudly and no one hears, hahaha." "Fern" obviously liked Sharon’s fear performance, so he stopped the tentacles and added them again. despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythmic knocking sounds suddenly, and the three people in the room are "solidified" in place just as if they were pressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who? At this time, how can someone knock on the door? Among the three, Finn was the most frightened. No one knows the situation better than him. In one or two years, there is not necessarily a smart life that knows how to knock on the door. And this is his own castle, and there is his own hard work to find the heart. The "dark fog" of the elders! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, he is like when he was a child, he was always stalking the legendary story of his father and mother, and then scared to sleep at night, occasionally When there is any noise, the hair will rise and the whole body will shake, and a cold will rise from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knocking on the door is not too big, it seems very polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who?" Fain retracted his tentacles and asked on alertly that as a Knight of Heaven, he still had basic qualities and no blind impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharon and Constance were surprised and frightened and looked forward to it. Even if they temporarily escaped the tragic fate, they did not let them breathe. "The castle is definitely not a special trip to save the two of them. It is very likely to be the enemy of "Fern", and the strong men of the Dark Mountain Range will not be better than the "Fern". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I." There was a gentle male voice coming in. "Since someone is there, I will come in."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows who "I" is! "Fern" couldn't figure out the strength of the other side, so he kept his heart in the dark and stopped at the same place. He didn't open the door. It is the core of the whole castle. It is surrounded by heavy defense tactics. It is not so easy to break in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw the door handle turn and the door slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! "Fern"'s eyes are more bloated, my extraordinary circle? What about my layers of defense? This room is the core of my control of the entire castle, the most defensive place, but how can they disappear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fern" stone statue standing in the same place, watching the door open completely, looking at a handsome man wearing a black double-breasted long dress Go slowly and come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
