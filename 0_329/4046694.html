			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Rhein looked at each other and saw the strange faces on each other. Is this Sarde deliberately exposed? He wants to lead himself to where? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ability to summon Silver Moon Aitna has not recovered due to injury, Rhein feels that in addition to this, he has reached a state of comparative peak. The "local tyrants" Lu Xien, in the case of well-equipped, also had confidence in their own strength, so the two dispersed, one after the other, guarding the corridors that came out of the sand of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde's breath began to move, constantly moving through the aisle, and finally into a gray room that was inconspicuous and easily overlooked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the room was not closed, so that Lucien and Rhein could see the situation inside in the aisle. The center was a deep pit, pit. The bottom and the surrounding are engraved with countless wonderful magical patterns, sometimes with different symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These patterns and symbols are not flat, but extend, toward the gray floor tiles, toward the surrounding walls, toward the void, spreading continuously, the whole The room is shrouded in a spell model, giving a sacred and strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bottom of the crater, the vague, translucent gray fragments smashed into a human shape, twisting toward the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the most complicated and incomprehensible spell model I have ever seen." Lucien himself has the legendary third-order to learn the "eternal blaze". There are more than the "uncertain hands" that the current Arcane masters have imagined, and I have seen the Aringe locks, but this magic array is far more complicated than they are, and this is only part of the performance, Lucy En believes that the patterns that have spread out and disappeared into the void, the bricks and the walls are not really disappearing, but are connected in some form to the whole door world and the dead world. They also have structures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, Lucien can assert as a great arcian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's expression is a bit weird, as if I remembered something, and finally spit it out: "I used to see some patterns in Tanos, I can't think of him from that time. I started studying similar things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde walked very slowly at the bottom of the pit, completely before the fast, so Lucien had time to think Shouldn't stop him, and ask curiously: "Mr. Rhein, are you and Tanos a good friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like to get to know potential Young people, watching them grow up, they will like to be a blood family. So, my good friends are many, Tanos happens to be one of them. Of course, he is also the most talented and most like a monster, hehe, You have already surpassed him in arcane," said Rhein with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about it, quite sighed: "It’s an observer, open a history book, and just point to a famous big man. It is very special and superior to say that he knows him and looks at him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have these hobbies left." Said, "It is a pity that there is no witness to the growth of Douglas. This is a great person who is comparable to Tanos. It even wins. After all, from the most difficult situation, it has created an arcane road and saved it. Magic, and in just four hundred years, it has grown to the point where the ancient magical empire was barely reached for thousands of years, and the number of legendary peaks is the same as that of the magical empire."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? When I first saw the question of the Speaker of the House, I was very impressed with him. I believe he is a great person. You will not see Mr. Rhein. "Rousse is doubtful, this is very supportive. Young observer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein shook his head: "At the end of the ancient magical empire and the early days of the Twilight War, Douglas did not figure out the best, perhaps his '100,000 why' habits and Strange thinking, so that he is incompatible with all the magicians of Antwerp at that time, not to be seen, plus his own strength is not calculated, step by step, it is easy to be covered up by many geniuses at that time, So I just looked away and didn't even understand him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the arcane system he created is my completely weak field, so the Magic Council later The great arcane master and legendary magician who grew up, I have no way to witness, except you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you identify the approximate function? I think this magic array is the key to the laboratory, and we can't experiment with ourselves, but if it is a magical array that makes people into monsters, Thrad changes and then Will deal with us..." Rhein seems to want to see what Sarder is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "It can only be reluctant to judge and resurrect. You see that the 'flame of origin' is also resurrected after the "destination meteor" In fact, there is a magical common sense. The more complicated and more powerful the magical array, the easier it is to be destroyed before the operation is completed. We can first see what Sarder is going to do. If there is something wrong, it will be played at a crucial moment. Broken, if there is a lock power protection at the beginning of the operation, then we will destroy immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Rhein itself has a tendency to get the road Sean’s explanation is in deep agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human form of the gray fragments lies in the six-pointed star in the center of the big pit, so that the magic lines around it are lit up, and the silver-white light is pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the magic lines are shining, the solid black and white ash death rushes in along the gray tiles and the patterns on the walls, a quiet and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough with the power of the Necromancer." Lucien seized the opportunity to remember and analyze the entire magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the pattern that extends to the void is dyed with sacred and majestic light, and the holy and vast atmosphere also floods into the big pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of Heaven Mountain..." Lucien was very surprised, death and life, ** and sacred? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not so bold before, so I could not judge this magical array to extract strength from Heaven Mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tedious black-and-white gray and pure light are centered on the translucent figure of Thrad, and then they entangle in a strange and unimaginable state. With the observation of Lucien, sometimes it shows solidified black and white ash, sometimes showing a lively and delicate milky white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt, who was shrouded in them, changed his body rapidly, and it fainted to the extreme. It was like flesh and blood. Gradually, the feeling of flesh and blood came to an end. The stronger it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Resurrection?" In the mind connection, Rhine himself asked himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there was a vast, high-pitched radiance in Sarde’s body, and a sacred sacred sacredness, the entanglement of death and life was suddenly destroyed, ** Distinguished with the sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde's body is condensed into gray pieces, which seem to be composed of endless unwillingness and despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not willing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vague screams, gray shards After a disintegration, Sarder completely disappeared into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this change, both Rhein and Lucien are a little bit fascinated. After a while, Lucien is half-hearted and shocked: “Salde spent a lot of energy to bring us here, just to die in front of us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein & Sarde had a deep hatred against him. The death was just incomprehensible, so I was immediately amused by Lucian’s words: “Maybe he really just wants to die in front of us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien recalled what he saw before, and took a deep breath: "At least I have a rough guess about the effect of this magical array. It should be more than just a resurrection... Thrad is the opportunity to resurrect himself, deliberately telling us the magic array. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, he did not expect that the power of God's descending surgery would be so terrible, actually extended to the present, but unfortunately, he is ambitious and brilliant. Also good at forbearance, but finally got a 'unwilling' end." Rhein used two , Have become quite sadly, you can pit their conspirators turned out to be such an outcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "His biggest problem is that he did not recognize the historical trend. The development of the parliament completely exceeded his imagination, but he carried it. This trend has changed. At the beginning, if he really chose the Southern Church, he may now become the pope of the legendary peak. The torrent of the times, rolling forward, and trying to go upstream, will be broken."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
