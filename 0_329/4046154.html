			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise first smiled and answered Betty: "When the castle of Baron Habero, thanks to your protection, I and Mr. Mars can be completely innocent, no less. A finger. Even if Betty didn't ask, I would invite you to my concert." Then he looked at Lucian with a little doubt. "Mr. Evans, what are you doing at the concert? What? Need me to help? Oh, and, are you willing to accept my invitation?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Lucien has always stressed that he has no title, everyone continues Call him a gentleman, not an adult or a master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Evans, if you have something to do at the concert, I can barely help." Mars had a hard time Grateful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks that before he was surrounded by evil, rotten undead, he was shuddering and nightmarish, if he was only an ordinary music consultant of Baron Habero, often Going back and forth between the towns of Gray and Kose, from time to time, attending the high-level social communication salons and banquets in Korse City. If they become a corpse, they are easily found, and I am afraid that I will have been pussy and rotted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty, Simon, and Joanna are delighted with Wise’s invitation, and equally strangely looking at Lucien, why did Mr. Evans go to the Musicians Association? Is he also a music lover? But along the way, he just listened to the music exchange between Wise and himself, and rarely interjected. Maybe he has friends at the Koster City Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Thank you Mr. Wise for your kindness, I may not have time to attend your concert. As for my affairs, it is only a small matter. I want to use the resources of the Katherine Musicians Association to send letters to my friends. Mr. Mars, you know, apart from the church, the most frequent communication between countries is the Musicians Association, Music Review and The Symphony Herald is available in every city in the mainland. The only difference is the number of periods of lag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no messenger in the world, but there is no postal system in all directions. Especially between different countries, ordinary people can only rely on caravans and travelers who pass by. Send a letter from afar. Of course, ordinary people do not have many relatives and friends in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mars gently squeezed his head and smiled: "Mr. Evans, you are a knight. If you really want to ask, the association cannot refuse, but also I won't let the 'Hasmere' eagle send you a letter, and it will charge you a high price. Oh, although I am a little older, I still have some status in the Katherine City Musicians Association. Let me help Mr. Evans. You deal with it, and ensure that your letter arrives in the hands of friends in the shortest time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Hasmere' eagle?" Lucien knows in addition to ordinary Beyond the common animals, they are all magical creatures. They have never heard of this breed of eagle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise Wenge smiled and said: "This is a special product of the Djibouti Principality. It is a huge and fast flying eagle. And after taming, it also has a pigeon identification direction. And the ability of the route, it takes only ten days to travel to and from Coser City and Aalto. Oh, so in the Djibouti Principal Musicians Association, you can see the latest issue of Music Review and after the fifth to seventh day of each month. "The Symphony Herald"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is July 2nd, it seems that it will take a few days to see the latest issue of these two newspapers." Lucien answered with regret, because it is possible to see the current situation of Natasha, Victor and others from the articles in these two newspapers. "Exactly my friend is in Aalto. Please ask Mr. Mars to help me. Let them receive my letter in a few days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkles on Mars’s face are stretched out: “Can help Mr. Evans You, my heart is much better. In fact, even without me, Mr. Wise is valued by the association. The degree can also help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mars, you have won the prize, I am just a newcomer who has just embarked on the music path." Wise replied modestly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars nodded slightly, turned and took the road to the Koster City Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien handed the last day’s employment expenses to Simon: “Thank you for your help all the way. I hope that you can start regular knight training as soon as possible. Maybe there is a chance to meet again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Evans. But I don't think I have yet to say goodbye because I am going to follow you. The musicians association looked at it, just by the way of Mr. Wise and Mr. Mars. Oh, I always wanted to visit the Musicians Association!” Betty said first, then blinked at her sister and brother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna glanced at Betty, but she was equally curious and said: "Then we will go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Coser City is the mainland A small city in the south-central region, but not one-fifth of Aalto, did not take long, Lu Xien and others saw the quaint iron-gray four-story building of the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards here are stricter than the Aalto Musicians Association, standing in front of the iron railings, not letting strangers in, until they see Mars, the famous music. The family was released, and he was sent to report to the director responsible for the regular affairs of the association, because the invited Mr. Wise came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of beautiful crystal ornaments, a huge oil painting of different musicians, stepping on a soft and silent dark red carpet, soft and bright wide space, together The hall of the Coser City Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Betty, Joanna and others were curiously looking around, there was a smiling middle-aged man in a black suit and a lot of people greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Wise, sincerely welcome and thank you for coming to our concert in Kosher City. I am the director of this Caspar, they It is the 'musician' and musician who is currently in the association." Casper is very enthusiastic about holding Wise's hands, this is a talented musician who is famous in the capital of the Principality, and no one in Coser City can really be A character called a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiseth smiled indifferently: "Mr. Caspar, you made me feel the enthusiasm and sincerity of Coser City..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary 'musicians' and musicians behind are also surrounded, and they are equally eager to welcome Wise, even directly in the hall to exchange music and discuss the tracks prepared by Wise. They took Lucien, Mars, and Betty all over the perimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so stylish!” Seeing the Coase City Musicians’ Association’s grand welcome to Wise, Betty not only didn’t mind being squeezed outside, but instead Both eyes exclaimed, "and the melody they discussed really sounded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joanna’s eyes were slightly blurred to her husband Simon: “Wait for you Inspire the blood to become a knight, we will return home once, and we will certainly be welcomed by the same grandeur."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being respected and being liked, everyone Like it, Simon is no exception. He focuses on the following: "I must start the regular knight training as early as Mr. Evans's warning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at such a lively scene, I smiled at Mars: "Mr. Mars, I went to the counter to write a letter and visited you to help me deal with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I followed you and told the little girl," Mars pointed at the seventeen-year-old. Haired girl, she tip-toe, craned his neck, he is trying to look to be surrounded Wise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cris." After they walked over to the counter, they saw that the girl did not turn around and greeted, and Mars called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clys did not return, and put a white palm: "There is nothing to say."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars shook his head with a funny smile, coughing a little, then the voice was slightly enlarged: "Crisis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? Mars Hello, sir, what do I need to do?” Chris was shocked and quickly stood up and asked uncomfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars escaped from the dead, in a good mood, more open-minded, did not pursue the impoliteness of the little girl, pointed to the way to Sean: "Give Mr. Evans paper , pen and envelope. Wait for him to finish, arrange the eagle letter to send to the Aalto Musicians Association as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It eats a lot of meat, fly once A lot of money." Chris took out the pen and paper and handed it to Lucien, while whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars’s serious face: “I will coordinate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clydes I vomited and spit out my tongue. I didn’t say much, and I took out a stack of newspapers: "Mr. Mars, this is the latest issue of Music Review and Symphony Herald. Do you need to buy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
