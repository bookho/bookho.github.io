			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Douglas" School of Magic, a seven-eighth-high tower of magic towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Celi sat in the classroom of the high-level apprentice class, and listened a little bit to Vernier’s "Elemental Basics", which is a trainee, Formal, high-level courses, from the shallower to the deeper, bring apprentices to the door of elemental magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, Reyia, they are said to have more than a dozen arcane points, already an official arcane..." Cherie is enviously admired Thinking about the situation of a few good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vernier said on the podium: "...the theory of ancient elemental magic was first introduced here, and the current elemental system is based on Lord Hathaway. Based on the atomic theory. What is an atom? It is the most basic substance, and it can no longer be divided. The same atom constitutes this kind of element, has various surnames, reacts differently, and combines all the substances in the world. This is also the basis of courses such as 'Magic Pharmacy' and 'Alchemy'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I came to Allinge a year ago, I have graduated and left school. I don’t have to listen to courses I already know, but also like Heidi. Join the Evans Institute's Atomic Research Institute and start a magical arcane experiment to become a true arcane master." Cheli in the daze is quite annoyed and feels that she has wasted a year's time. by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Velnia continues the course and is very pleased with the highly dedicated apprentices who know the important surnames of arcane and magic learning, understand it directly Representing power, power, and status, so few people are slack and sloppy, and they are exactly the same as the apprentices who just started the magic school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-order apprentices of the Douglas Magic School who have been expelled for years of learning attitudes can count clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I brought some pure elements, you first know each other, then experiment to understand their surnames, as well as different alchemy reactions and potions. The role of the system." Vernier took out a bottle of magical seal elements, and at the same time opened the magic array, turning the platform into an alchemy platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and formal apprenticeships seldom talk so deeply about the nature of the elements, just lead the students to understand the elements, know the basic surname, remember the magical reaction equation, Develop their magical research skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorgeous magical ray of light pulls Cherie’s thought back and sees that Vernier lifted two bottles of elements: “This is two structures of carbon. Elements...Atoms make up elements, and carbon is the main constituent of the human body..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the grainy, transparent diamonds and shimmering metallic luster The dark gray opaque "scales", even if Cherie had heard about Lucien, there was a strong shock at this time: "The carbon of different structures is like the difference between angels and demons..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And is it the main constituent element of the human body?" Chely looked at her slender and delicate hands, and it was hard to imagine that it was different from the "appearance" in the bottle. Consistent carbon composition, "Carbon can also be divided into carbon atoms, and other elements of the body are also, is the essence of 'I' is such a tiny particle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning to look out the window, the big tree like the phoenix tree is green and full, one wears Color high-hat, man wearing dark suit holding a walking stick from a tree after he came across a lady wearing a light purple cake skirt graceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of gentleman, such a beautiful and intelligent woman, is this colorful and splendid world composed of small atoms that cannot be divided? "Chee, who hasn't officially stepped into the magical world, is a bit unimaginable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Atomic Research Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien improved the magical array of vacuums and tried the experiment again. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the cathode ray has a continuous last name deflection in the electromagnetic field, Lucien took a deep breath and began to adjust the magical array of magnetic and electric fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Lucien recorded the data and began to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the particles contained in the cathode ray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wave of peace of mind, and naturally there is no illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the experiment between different places in the room, it was said that Lucien was not affected at all, and the answer was accurately calculated:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Charge-to-mass ratio, one-seven-six-tenth-tenth-tenth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! In the spiritual world of Lucian, the meditation environment is reborn and changed. The different elements are suddenly magnified, surrounded by countless tiny rays, and the track is mysterious. It seems to contain infinite secrets...<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the electron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electron that breaks the indivisible illusion of the atom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The microscopic world is far more complicated than the arcane masters, and will be more exciting and more incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Rentart, inside the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trainee pastor after listening to the story of Bishop Abidal, asked in confusion: "The bishop, why does God not directly create people, create everything, but instead Do you want to create atoms first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daniel, don't think about how to do it for the Lord! Since the Lord first created the atom, the material study of the world and the human body also shows this. That must have His deep meaning in it." Abidal screamed at the question of the trainee Daniel, which is the mortal's idea of ​​speculating God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was in the late Twilight War, Daniel would be arrested immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abidal looked at the apprentice pastors who seemed a little frightened, and the voice eased a bit: "The inseparable surname of the atom is the embodiment of its holy name. It represents the Lord's domination of the world, which is impossible for the Arcanists who claim to master the truth of the world. You only need to remember this and use it in the study of the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Bishop." The trainee pastors answered with a compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abidal nodded with satisfaction, ordinary priests only need to know the extent of this approximation, anyway, all roots can be attributed to the Lord - more in-depth study is very It is easy to embark on the path of the evil magician, and it is easy to be confused by the theory of the magical parliament, which is swallowed up by the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Magic Council’s assumption that “energy is a share” has no effect on its own clerics, and it’s continuous or discontinuous. It is created by the Lord! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ From those trajectories, Lucien captured the wonderful symbol of perfecting his "Elemental Order" magic, but it is not complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is probably because of what, but Lucien did not force change his cognitive world, for himself, logical derivation, formula, theory Verification and experiments confirm that these steps must be done before building the cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the world and the Earth’s cosmological constants are consistent, they cannot be blindly constructed according to the experience of the Earth, otherwise it is easy to explode when the two worlds are different. Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice is the only criterion for testing truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After remembering the new magic symbols, Lucien changed the composition of the metal material in the core of the cathode magic array and the low-pressure gas, and redo the experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the Glory Cathedral of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filliebel took out a message from the holy city of Lance: "According to the confirmation, Fernando’s newly accepted student Lucien Evans? X It was the musician Lucy Evans who died in the city of the Holy Ghost. Sald has assigned several vigils to help deal with this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominates The Arcanist, his attention to him has always been one of the key points of the church, so even if he only became his disciple, Lucien was highly valued, and the information was communicated to the cardinals and cardinals of the various parishes, and then He was quickly recognized by the people of the Vaorrit Parish as another identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
