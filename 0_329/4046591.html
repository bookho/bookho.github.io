			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary clergyman white robe, slightly sullen eyes, if not temperament calm and deep, Sald and Rantart street sun-drenched civilians It is hard for the old man to say that there is any difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at the empty church square and laughed and said: "I am still worried that the storm dominates you and dare not come."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a stormy momentum and sneered: "Is there anything I dare not come to? Is the church watching us continue to grow and develop? I bet that it will be ten or sixty. In the year, when the Pope’s gods are restored next year, he will launch a full-scale war against us, so it’s better for us to take the initiative.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rapid development of this century, From time to time, there will be subversive achievements of the Holy Scriptures or the Holy Scriptures. The Magic Council has become the focus of the church's current containment and combat. It is no longer possible to bury its head and enjoy the peace of the North and South churches silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a force develops to a certain stage, it must have a war with the original controller to gain room for continued development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the past decade, the Magic Council has been provoking the church, just to let them break out a controlled local war in the absence of preparation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that the Pope was restrained by the Northern Church and the Dark House, and the corresponding mobilization and mediation preparations were not prepared, the highest scrutiny of the Magic Council believed that the legendary magic could be The loss of the division is controlled to a certain extent. In this way, there is a basis for striving for the seven epic knights. However, the pope has always been rational and has been suppressing the radical movement inside the church and preparing it step by step. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, the magic parliament is under tremendous pressure. If it is not the follow-up effect of the blushing moon event, the magic parliament may have been chased by the church. Now, this is the adventure of Douglas's use of artificial planet experiments to deceive the Pope's gods, so that the situation can be changed again and more time is prepared. Even without Sald seeking cooperation, the parliament will try this year or next year. The war was provoked at the beginning <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Thrall, the Pope judged that the parliament could develop to the point where it could not be contained for 60 years, so the full-scale war would erupt in ten or twenty years. Fernando and other members of the highest scrutiny team are completely unbelievable. The Pope and the Cardinal members are not blind. In recent years, the rapid expansion of the theory of arcaneism, they cannot be invisible, it is impossible not to make new estimates, and, most importantly The discovery, before the discovery of the new alien space, the Pope issued a full-scale war order due to the new alchemy, but was later delayed by the more important search for the god-like action. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, big arcans such as Douglas have reason to believe that in the case that the situation in the new alien space has gradually stabilized, the Pope will In addition to the focus of the Magic Council, perhaps this time next year, it is a full-scale war with sufficient preparations for the church. If so, it is better to take the initiative to provoke changes in the situation, create a general trend, and avoid throwing a legendary peak as a cannon. The terrible situation of God's descending surgery - no legendary summit will be willing to die, which will bring about internal division of the parliament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Salter’s cooperation is such an opportunity to cater to the idea of ​​the Parliament’s plan to launch this year or early next year. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the most detailed plan for the parliament’s action was to report to the Pope’s sudden arrival of fifteen or six cardinal members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde smiled: "Sure enough, it is a vibrant magical parliament. After nearly a thousand years, the church has slowly become decayed, only blood and Fire can make it glow with new life. You go in, the enchantment of the magic has been closed, and even the gentle clerics I have found the opportunity to send to Richard, there are only a few people left, including on behalf of my supervision process. Vera Amorton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He requested that the Glorious Cathedral be preserved in addition to the transmission array for future use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stingy and eager attitude seems to indicate the sincerity of his cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the enchantment of the magic, Fernando’s spiritual field is unobstructed to cover the Glorious Cathedral, but he did not care to follow the elements that came. The president of the will, Donald, and his students, the student pedigree, are advanced to control the core of the enchantment and the super large transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are biased towards the Magic Council, they also have the same ideas as the Northern Church under the temptation of Sarde, and they do not want to live under the miraculous pressure of the Magic Council, but they see the Glorious Cathedral, the truth god, opposite the Stormwind Strait. The symbol of effective control is controlled by the magicians, and it is inevitable that there will be a feeling of ignorance and redness in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A time is over? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the sturdiness of the super-large transmission array, it was difficult for the Grand Masters to destroy them directly, so Fernando dragged the red magic robe to the Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Thrard smiled and said: "I will quit Rentart first, eliminate your doubts, and wait until you have complete control over this area, I Come again to crown the Archbishop of Glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando glanced at him with a stormy eye, did not say anything, directly crossed him, "absolute defense" Atumman followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde laughed twice, seemingly walking but walking out of the church square very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge" I did not know when I had flown over Lentstadt, and the intercepted railroad tracks were all collected, like a battle fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sits on the 35th floor of the Central Magic Tower and orders: "Atlant, you are staring at Sald."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Eye of the Curse" nodded, and the closed eyes opened, and there seemed to be a world of fascinating fascination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east of the city belongs to the aristocratic area, regardless of the Nexus Palace or the Glorious Cathedral, so the scenery is beautiful and the population density is extremely low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Sarde came out, there was a knight who was beating the dragonscale horse and galloping quickly on the wide and deserted avenue. The midday sun was fierce and he almost did not meet. Whoever arrived at the villa of the Duke of James. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her Majesty’s request for an emergency aristocratic meeting." James said puzzledly, and the time requirements were tight, almost only letting the aristocrats of Rantat participate, the field Can't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recognizing the true heraldry, the Duke of James went to Nexel Palace with a full stomach question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the remote corner of the northwestern Necker Palace, Lucien leaned behind a big tree like a sycamore, waiting for orders, hoping for the best situation. Don't happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, don't be nervous." Morris took the members of the royal family of Holm and flew in the direction of the Royal Magic Tower, the road to the ground. Sean called and then flew to the other side of the Nexus Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord Morris, I am not nervous." Lucien witnessed them go away, and answered coldly and humorously, he looked wide on both sides of the road. Aristocratic villas, can not help but think of the Joel family, they under the "arrangement" of Natasha, went to the manor on the outskirts, so as not to be affected by possible war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappearance of Juliana and Minsk has always made Lucien somewhat uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that there will be no plan five... The plan three is also best not to appear..." Lucien quietly hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the West End of the Monastery, Hathaway, a dark black magic robe, stood quietly in the shade, waiting for Fernando to destroy the super large transmission array, to At that time she will destroy some of the radical clerics in the entire Grail Knights and the Rantat Monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the legendary first-order sacred knight Shidong, she is not careless but not overly concerned. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 35th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, information from all over the world Returned one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elika controls the Cox Cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vicente Control The Cathedral of Blanes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
