			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the "曰之冕" unleashes a layer of seal, the atmosphere of the Necromancer that can be sensed by it must be strong enough and the distance must be very close. This means that there is a horrible undead creature hidden by Lucien, and that one blow can kill the powerful undead of the lower-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the road to the spirit of the senses, the entire study has no strange places, and from any angle, there is only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter sunshine and the sun, the warmth of the sun on the body, Lucien did not feel warm, but the bitter chill rose, creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly resisting fear and fear, Lucien quietly picked up a card and "read carefully" the elemental surname of the abstract above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm of the cockroach is getting stronger and stronger. Lucien looks at the cards in his hand, and his heart is inexplicable: just beside his cheek, just in the In parallel with his own head, there is a clear and clear pale head, which is full of bright red eyes, and carefully read the elemental cards with himself, while the opposite mirror only has his own focused figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a pale hand to monitor me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't seem to have Link me to the professor, otherwise it’s not just monitoring....”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the thoughts, Lucien looked at the elemental cards one by one. Like all hard-working and beginners, I have tirelessly memorized, understood and mastered the various surnames of different elements. I have not shown a slight difference. I just thought: "You must write an arcane research paper as soon as possible..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afternoon time passed quickly, Lucien put down the cards and walked out of the study, and the burning of "曰之冕" has become like a warmth. Explain that the powerful undead is a little far away from himself, but does not really leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, it’s just monitoring." Lucien relaxed a little bit, as long as he didn’t show an abnormality and lived normally according to the pattern of the past week, there is no value. The place that others doubt, but this does not allow Lucien to completely relax. No one knows how long the patience of the pale hand can last, and whether it leaves or uses other means after not finding the abnormality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After dinner, Lucien came to the Magic Experiment Tower as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they stepped into the tower, the warmth of "曰之冕" disappeared completely and returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this magic tower is equipped with a strong protective magic array, so that the undead who monitors me is afraid to come in." Lucien was half-hearted. If you find this, it will cause people to collapse if they are monitored anytime, anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time K walked in and saw Lucien, and he was delighted to say: "Lu Xien, I thought you didn't have the mood to do magic experiments today. You are tougher than I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a self-destructive person who has been hit hard." Lucien laughed and walked alongside K. "Yes, K, what is your paper published in the "Elements" journal? I was hit today, and I fell into the joy of being quoted by the Archaic Master, and I forgot to read the "Elements" journal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K is a little embarrassed to scratch his head: "It’s about the magical pharmacy and alchemy reaction, the element is always combined with a fixed number of other molecules, This is the question of the valence price that Mr. Larry said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the basic problem of elemental magic. No wonder K is valued by Mr. Larry. I have to wait. Looking for it, it is suitable for my recent magic experiment of mastering the element's surname." Lucien smiled and praised it. Sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K became more embarrassed, smiled and didn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, several people on the third floor of the Magic Tower passed through the stairs and just saw Lucien and K. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Mr. Mr. Evans, good evening." He spoke of an ordinary ordinary black-haired young man with a silent face. It looks like a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After responding politely, he did not look at Beatt and his companions and continued on the stairs leading to the fourth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien politely and coldly gently squeezed the jaws, and did not say anything to follow K's step on the upper level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that Mr. Evans has not really reflected on his mistakes." Seeing the performance of Lucien, Beyat laughed, "also I hate us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K jerked around, and the thick voice contained anger: "Beyat, I know that Lucien’s teaching style is indeed contrary. School rules, but why don't you advise him a few words? If he doesn't want to correct it, then it is not too late to complain. Are you just so careful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, the well-recognized good guys are also angry.” Beyate’s companion, Benoa, who excels at electromagnetics and astrology, exaggerated and exaggerated, and then his slender face became serious. “This is a serious violation of the school rules and contrary to the long-standing tradition. Things, how can we cover up and persuade privately? Only by letting Mr. Evans be punished can he learn the lesson and remember it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants to speak, Bayat has already smiled and looked at K: "It is not a big deal to violate the school rules, electromagnetic waves. Development is the most important thing now. K, if you still insist on spiritual particles, insist that the atom is the foundation of the world and cannot change the concept of arcane. I am worried that when you meditate, the head will blast open. Ha, we have to understand the application of electromagnetic waves according to the magic experiment dominated by the storm, and do not bother you to continue to study the elements~"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail is prolonged, he is usually silent So arrogant, several of his companions are similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at them angrily and turned away, and puzzled: "K, why do you blast your head when you meditate?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a guy who still lacks a lot of magical common sense, Lucien can only ask K around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K is not so angry with Beatt’s satire, the heavy voice echoes in the stairwell: “This comes from the speaker’s account of meditation. There is no exact theoretical basis and it is not included in the basic books of the Arcane, so you don’t know it for the time being. He believes that the meditation environment is the realization of its own understanding of the nature of the world. What kind of ideas and knowledge are there? Meditation environment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded secretly, without interjecting, it seems that it is not only his own feelings, but Mr. Douglas who laid the foundation of the arcane also thinks so. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the more than a dozen meditations that are generally applicable, different meditation environments correspond to different meditations. If the meditation environment conflicts with the meditation, or in meditation If you continue to meditate in an unstable environment, there is a danger of mental explosion, which may damage your soul and brain structure, or you may blow your head directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a theory of subversion surnames appears, if the magician can't accept it, can't master it, and can't adjust his own cognition according to it, then the meditation environment will not change. And a magician or a wise creature, if it is to the world, right The concept of magic cognition has been established, and it is difficult to be changed by external forces. Therefore, the magician who cannot accept the new theory of subversion is often occupied. For example, the speaker of the "Arcane" journal will write another article. A magic experiment denies that mental power is an electromagnetic wave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the correct surname of this theory is unquestionable, even the unacceptable magician himself When they can't deny, their conception of the world and the magic will collapse completely. Cognition will fall into the contradiction of extreme chaos. The meditation environment will become very unstable. The light will be stagnant and the serious soul may be damaged. Even die directly. There are only a few excellent magicians who can rebuild their cognitive world and step into the right path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the confidence received The blow can also be ignored, and it will also affect the efficiency of meditation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the Lucien is listening, the more frightened, it is no wonder that at the death feast, Felipe faced Synthetic urea will be so excited, he thought he was arrogant, and it was difficult to give up the theory of human life mechanics. Now I understand the extent of the danger at that time! Fortunately, urea does not have the right to decide the surname, neither the world nor the earth, can completely negate the theory of human life mechanics, coupled with the shock of the reputation of the church purification sequence, it is dangerous to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
