			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chilly winter night with snow flakes, a fascinating magical crystal lamp sets off the villa of the Duke of James, beautiful and dazzling. Like the deep night sky, the stars are gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a high-level magician, no one will set up their magic tower with crystal lights. They often use the magic candle lighting for their surnames, anyway. The effect is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of the nobles present here, they understand today what is truly a brilliant light, beautiful, and beyond the natural scenery, and so on. The dream scene, which comes from the great power of human beings to change the world, can be popularized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please invite distinguished guests to enter the villa." Barry’s female student Lilian seems to be the ceremonial ceremonial ceremonial, smiling to indicate that everyone is stepping into this sun-like king. The "splendor" villa of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady who loves beauty, carrying her own skirt, gazing, swaying, can’t wait to enter the villa of the Duke of James, the gentlemen are tight Then, curious and admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect seems to be very good, the initial promotion of our magical crystal lamp seems to be no problem." As a man who is devoted to making money, Arthur Soon after, I recovered from the scene of this shocking surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he has never seen a similar spectacular scene in the past, it does not prevent him from putting most of his mind on observing the reaction of the nobles to the magic crystal lamp. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to install my magic tower too!" Aphrodite has the least resistance to the shiny things, just brightly lit It is a saliva, "I pay with the Arcane Point!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a treasure, gold, gems, crystals, etc. All the hardships, Lucien even suspected that it had "corrupted" most of the materials used to build the magic tower, and then it became the ugly and ugly mountain look - anyway, in Aringe, not afraid of being attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can only be limited to the nobility, if it can not reduce costs again, spread to the public class, it loses its meaning of simplifying promotion, this is every human being The enjoyment of the achievements of civilization.” Lu Xi’an feels that the advancement of a civilization should be seen as the change and improvement it brings to the lives of most members of society. Now, the upcoming electrical era will have This ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur ruined Lucien’s emotions with incomprehensibility: “But, I’m afraid there is no hope of reducing costs again in a short time.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, we need a lot of skilled workers to separate some of the steps that don't require magic, and to compress costs through assembly, standardization, etc." Lucien Capitals likes to decapitate I thought of the descendants of the dwarves in the night plateau, but they caused such a big change for the vampire family. They were no longer suitable to pick them up in a short time. At least two or three years later, when everyone’s attention was completely transferred to When the new unknown space is searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It took a long time for a large number of skilled workers to develop..." Arthur didn't understand what was meant by the assembly line and standardization, but for the time being, he was not interested in asking because Even the basic premise can't be reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lillian closed the main crystal lamp in the banquet hall, leaving only a few small ones, and the light immediately became bleak and brought out. Warm and romantic feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled humorously: "Don't worry that the popularity of magical crystal lamps will make us lose the romantic atmosphere of dinner under candlelight. Romantic is always the soul and feelings. As long as you do it with all your heart and soul, you will be able to create the feeling you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you walk through the corridors of the castle at night, you don't have to worry too much about the candlelight. Dark, the environment is too gloomy, the bright feeling will always accompany everyone with the use of magic crystal lights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啧, Lucien licked her teeth, she It should be the money of Arthur. In order to promote the magic crystal lamp, I spare no effort, but I like it! This can bring significant annuity benefits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the villa of the Duke of James, the banquet entered an elegant court dance session - the conservative Holm kingdom has not yet begun to prevail in the court of Tria The dance of the circle. The dances with their backs and tight cuddles made many old aristocrats resentful. Only when some young people gathered in private, they danced in the name of pornography. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The set in her mouth refers to the set needed to renovate a complete villa, and the price is only equivalent to the previous one of the magic crystal lamps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook the sky blue in the shaker and smiled: "This is due to the convenience of current transfer energy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, to be honest, when the lady just pressed the switch, I was shocked by the bright lights. There was a feeling of incomprehensibility, which was both dreamy and beautiful. Proud, and all this is your masterpiece, you are a miracle magician." The aristocratic girl's face is reddish and her eyes are like water. "Even if I have no magician and knight talent, I can use it. Don't envy other people anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "Popularize some of the alchemy items so that most people can use them without barriers. They are my ideals." Especially in terms of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are such a great person." The aristocratic girl sincerely admire that Lu Xi'en, a cheeky guy, couldn't help but blush, <br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alchemy items that most people can use, Evans, you are really far-reaching..." James Duke and the seven-ring Master Barrek came over and listened After the words of Lucien, he whispered a whisper, and seemed to be keenly aware of the hidden purpose of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Duke of James, the aristocratic girl’s face was a little redder, and she quickly said to Lucien: “Mr. Evans, do not bother you and the Duke’s exchange. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Evans, how do you stand by like the old guys like us? Just now Julie’s face is full of 'Please dance.' ''Please let me dance,' you mean, you are indifferent? Can't you look at our lovely little Julie? She is the baby granddaughter of Earl of Pine." James started the joke of Lucien, "I noticed, Have you deliberately ignored several beautiful ladies before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stunned the sky blue, half exaggerated: "Maybe, my heart is really old It’s not like a young man.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young and handsome, gentle and elegant, talented, highly qualified, promising, wealthy, in the eyes of noble women’s surnames Such an image of Lucien, naturally attracted the favor of many women, and this is the opening of pro-magic School banquet, they marry for the magician and no prejudice, often even fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James sneered two times and then said: "The magical flow of water flowing into electricity is increased, and the lines of transportation currents are popular, and they enter the public class. I can probably use the simplified part of the alchemy items cheaply and conveniently, and wait until they get used to this kind of life. After this kind of life brought by magic instead of the gods, I think Evans is your purpose. Almost reached."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien felt that he should re-recognize the Duke of James. Although his appearance is a fierce and reckless bald man, his heart is quite sensitive and thinking. It is also very open. I just guessed a lot of things from the words I said casually. Fortunately, he is an alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the wire and power drive are popularized, we have to consider an important issue. The current is much more dangerous than a candle, and the candle is at most Burned, but broken wires are likely to die directly, which will allow the church to magicalize the current and prevent its promotion." Lucien said he was planning a recent question. At present, electric energy is the cheapest and most easily transmitted energy, not directly comparable to mental energy, solar energy, and tidal energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James looked sideways at Barrek and got a positive answer: "Magic Lab of the Electromagnetic System, the magician who forgot to do the electric shock protection and died unexpectedly every year There are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 50th place in Aringe’s most stupid death method has this one: "Poor magician Ossan, in a magic In the experimental accident, a more powerful lightning-like spell was discovered, so he was pleased to be greeted with excitement. At this time, he discovered that the spherical lightning that filled the house exceeded his protective spell limit. Let us thank him for improving The outstanding contribution of the spherical lightning magic, and more thanks to him using the blackened body to tell us that we must stay away from the uncontrolled current."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do? Ivan Since you think of it, there must be a way." James smiled at Lucien and seemed to believe his ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not anxious: "The damage caused by current to the human body cannot be eliminated. We cannot force the users to be magicians, nor can we A piece of wire is magically isolated. I hope that Mr. Barrek's electromagnet master can write a "Safety Power Handbook" to teach people how to use electricity safely to avoid possible dangers."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
