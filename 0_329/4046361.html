			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being familiar with Lucien, Lazar has become accustomed to being quiet, calm, and elegant. He will occasionally say something that everyone can’t understand and entertain himself. Self-interest, so he smiled and replaced him: "Mr. Eric, you open the "Arcane", the first one, look at the first one, you can understand why Lu Xi'an wrote an inscription, why should I write this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric heard Lazar's words, quickly turned over "Arcane", skipped the catalog, and saw the fifth-level arcane in the first post. Teacher, five-ring magician Lu Xien? Evans? The name of X. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sight shift, the title of the paper appears in his eyes:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""A new particle Discovery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Particles? This Month..." Reminiscent of friends from time to time this month or writing letters to discuss atomic issues with themselves, Erie Ke fainted the excitement and uneasy hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Eric, pay attention to stay calm." Seeing Eric seems to be a more obvious expression of the stiff face stuck by the glue, pull Zal’s low smile, he knows that Eric is not good at elemental magic, and certainly will not use atomism as the basis of the cognitive world, so he is not worried that he will poke his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric quickly passed the paper and jerked his head up. A pair of light gray eyes on the dull face illuminate the enthusiasm: "It’s much smaller than the atom." , the new particle, Lucien, the truth of the world is more complicated than we think! Your contribution can be compared with the existence of the planet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For researchers of mathematics and magic, this is more important than the law of elemental cycle and energy discontinuity. The former only summarizes the law, the latter is limited to the hypothesis, and the discovery of electrons will cover the veil of the world. Opening a layer is a further manifestation of the essence of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they really exist..." Lucien added a subconscious mind, and did not expect Mr. Eric to remain in a specific administrative position. A few points are purely about the arcane, the real hobby of exploring the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the existence of the planet has not yet been determined, and the meaning of electron discovery should be compared with the electromagnetic wave, the electromagnetic equation, the three laws, and the miracle experiment. To the starry sky, to the extent that we are among them, it is such a 'small one.'" Eric quickly corrected his mistakes, with ambiguous words in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard resisted his urge to ridicule again. After all, this is the deacon, turning his head and laughing at Lucien: "Mr. Eric, I have never seen it. I only heard that he occasionally appeared in a magic school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Eric calmed down I have alienated my rare hair: "Evans, there is no problem with your inscription! You are right, the door to the micro world is opening to us, how small can the material be?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The micro world we know so little now, we need all the arcans to explore together. However, Mr. Eric, the discussion of truth can lag behind, first help me out the documents and badges, Otherwise, other important things will not be transmitted." Lucien ten fingers crossed and closed, reminding reminders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric remembered the badges and documents in the small cage, so he reached for it and said to Lucien: "Arcane" There is a paragraph on the title page: '10th issue of the 7th year, especially given to Mr. Evans.'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special Collector's Edition..." Lucy I didn't expect "Arcane" to have this thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Six or six?!" Eric spoke a little, and the badge in his hand and the two documents was six silver stars on the black background. The ray of light seems to sway the eyes of the flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sixth level?" Lazar looked at the past and was equally shocked. He knew that e-discovery would give Lucien a generous reward, but Unexpectedly, he can now become a six-level arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a Sixth-Level Arcane Master is a high-level threshold for the brightest, belonging to the upper class of the Magic Council! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it wrong with the badge?" Eric has some doubts: "Lusien Evans, Arcane points three thousand and sixty Nine, really is six levels..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, can I see?" Although I was eager to know how much the e-discovery score came, Eric did not forget the etiquette, especially Lu Xien has become a six-level arcane master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not mind laughing: "Mr. Eric, read it, Lazar seems to want to hear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order not to spread the name of the surname, Lucien submitted the paper only a few days ago, and did not expect the audit result to be returned with the journal in which the paper was published. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't seem, yes." Lazar laughed at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raven's comment is: 'Simple but classic experiment, confirming a particle that is smaller than an atom in magnitude, showing an implication A new field of infinite possibilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery of Lucien Evans is undoubtedly the creation of a surname, which opens the door to the microcosm, perhaps in the future Will change our era, and when we look back at that time, we can really confirm the significance of this discovery. At the same time, it breaks through the old concept, subverts the theory that the atom is the most basic material, and has a very important surname and Discuss the value, it is recommended to reward the Arcane points 600, the Arcane point is 5,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric will review the assessment results of the review committee member Ravendi But the rewards for arcane points are not as much as they think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter's rating words are similar to those of Lavin. The reward points are also 600, so the comprehensive rating is:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The creation of surnames in the microscopic field has broken through some of the limitations of atomic theory. It is a contribution of extremely important surnames in the field of elemental magic. It is of great value in discussion and may bring new microscopic in a certain sense. In the era, rewards 600 points for arcane points and 5,000 arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evaluation value of the periodic table is higher, but the micro age does not know when Can really come, Lucien, you have two papers of this level, and let us not retain confidence!" Lazar half-jokingly congratulated, "However, only six hundred arcane points, the poor one Where did you get a thousand arcane points?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there a copy?" Lucien pointed to Eric’s paper, since When you are in public, you are ready to be exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric quickly opened another document, then suddenly looked up, his face stiff and strange, and his voice shook slightly: "Is the miracle experiment designed by you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!" Lazar suspected that he had got it wrong, although he was not qualified to be in the manor when he was in public, but later based on the published paper After renting an alchemy laboratory, the simulated original environment is just the result of normal gas and water, which can slowly generate life source. The mystery of life is so profound and fascinating, especially the elemental system he is good at. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, there was no strength to bear the consequences of the experiment, so we chose to keep secret. Now, everything is different." Since the beginning of the cognitive world and electronic After mapping, the effect of Lucian meditation is doubled, with sufficient financial resources to purchase medicines and materials, perhaps within five or six years, the soul and mental power can directly interfere with reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you are a monster!" Lazar did not know how to express his shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric lingered for a while before revealing a bitter smile: "This miracle experiment almost dragged the god of truth to the throne, Evans, you are uncompromising The genius of the Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also the crazy arcane master, he added in his heart, "You have to be careful, new particles, miracle experiments, churches not I will let you go, and the magician who is stagnant inside the council may also go to extremes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for reminding me, I am ready." Lucian nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The comprehensive evaluation is: This experiment shows us a possibility of the origin of life, simple and full of unspeakable mysteries, like a miracle, The results of the creation of surnames, breakthrough surnames and extremely important surnames in the field of origin of life are of great value in discussion, rewarding 600 arcane points and 5,000 arcane points." Eric will finish the assessment quickly, "plus these two More than a thousand points are enough for this experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
