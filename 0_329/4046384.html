			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dominate everything, control the boundaries between life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elder Augustus has two hands that are extremely distorted, and the waist is swung left and right, and the pace is extremely chaotic. However, if you look closely, you can feel a little mysterious taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves such as Mirana and Harold who followed him to "pray" have been stunned by this complicated "dance" movement, and they are difficult to imitate. Strive to persist, and keep saying: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You give us life, give us food, give us the courage to face difficulties, and give us goodness and integrity. Pity and determination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the hall, the empty place, the four transparent figures are watching the prayers of the dwarves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gestures they prayed are like the gestures and gestures of some rituals of the ancient magical empire." The vampire bride Tess uses the kinship talent instinct for "short-distance communication" To the follow-up housekeeper Galata, the supervisor Wells and the accompanying maid Edith, the tone is doubtful and funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They actually found the hiding place of the Dwarf Rebels! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wells and Edith are both blood servants. They have lived in the dark plateau since childhood, and the farthest went to the nearby Vampire Lords Castle. How is it possible? Knowing the rituals of the ancient magical empire, so after hearing Tess's words, they are all unassuming, I don't know how to answer them - the study in the castle is the blood servant they can use, especially Wells is even a kind of text do not know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs, the action of the old dwarf is too complicated and too distorted, and it differs greatly from the magical ritual." The vampire butler Galata replied reverently, "It is more like The sacrificial dance of the Church of Truth when it first developed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the original ritual movement of the Truth is changed from a simple magical ritual, and, Gala Tower, you didn't see it? The reason why the old dwarf's movements are complicated and distorted is because he is playing a magician in six different directions and different movements, and he can even stand up..." Tess whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Wells and Edith buried their heads low and did not dare to interject at this time. The low-lying dwarves are unclear, how can they not know how to wait for the noble blood servant, the lord Vlad is wounded by the magic of the gods of truth in a later period of the war called "Twilight", and has not been cured. These centuries have been sleeping a lot, and have not left the "night plateau" step. Therefore, in the castle, the topic of truth is a taboo. Only the orthodox family such as Mrs. Tess and Mr. Galata can discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs, your eyes are very good, it's a bit like it." Butler Galata looked closely for a while, agreeing with Tess's guess, "but their The prayer is definitely not a mantra, so the ceremony will not have any effect, but in this case, I can't see which ritual is specific."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, Anyway, the ritual will not have any effect. We can take these stinking dwarves and then we can torture it out.” Tess sneered, standing completely in the position of the vampire. “Don’t dare to pray for the gods? I don’t know that I hate the missionaries the most. Pastor, bishop? They made my dear Vlad not always accompany me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thanks to the lady, your eyes are sharp, we can find the dwarf There was a problem and found the hiding place of the Rebels.” Wells was afraid that Mrs. Tess couldn’t control her emotions, and it was very likely to hurt herself, so the semi-transfer topic was flatteringly flattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tess smiled a little: "In the castle, at least three years of slavery, he can still maintain vitality and vitality, hey, if not in my heart I hope that it should have been as dead and numb as a normal dwarf. This contrast is very good, indicating that he is likely to have problems. I don’t think it is related to the rebel army."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. You are right, the dwarves are not worthy of hope, they are captive cows!" Edith followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the prayer ceremony is coming to an end, there is no more onlookers, Tess waved his hand: "Kill them, hang on the castle wall and dry, shocking other dwarves, Lest you be laughed at by other counts and viscounts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold followed the great elder Augustus and whispered, whispering: "Great life and death dominate, you love us, just like you have the highest authority. We must let all the population smash your Name, honor you as holy. May your glory shine away from all sufferings and evils."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May your steam name come again!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the prayer, he quietly added: "I hope to rebuild a brilliant steam civilization under your blessing!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! what! The inner voice just fell, two consecutive screams of screams, Harold slammed up and looked at the entrance to the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four figures are slowly emerging, it is the familiar Mrs. Tess, the Galata Butler, the Welsh Supervisor and the Edith Maid, among them Galata Holding a dwarf at the end of the team, two white fangs plunged deep into his neck, and Wells shimmered the metal luster on his hands, cutting off the throat of another dwarf, and spraying the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood servant is not qualified to enjoy the blood, even if it is wasted, it cannot be exceeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are here?!" Harold blurted out in a panic and shivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glamorous dwarf vampire Tess took out a "nightingale" shawl from the Kingdom of Holm, gently rubbing the corners of his mouth, like laughing and laughing : "Don't you bring us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf rebel army stunned by the vampire's sudden emergence and cruel killing, all turned to look at Kazakhstan Rhodes, there are doubts in his eyes, hatred, contempt, and bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harold, why are you selling us?" Quinkins took the giant axe and cut down the shameful traitor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf girl Mirana looks incredibly at her companion: "I believe in you like that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have not betrayed you, Grand Elder, Mirna, Uncle Warren, Uncle Quinkins, I don't, I don't! You must believe me!" Harold frightened desperately to other dwarves Explain that I forgot the situation of being surrounded by vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tess giggled and glanced at Galata and waited not to be busy killing. She really liked the feeling of playing with people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe in you, Harold, you have to sell us, just bring them in." Grand elder Augustus is calm and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder..." Harold had a feeling of dawn, even though he only knew what was called dawn in the story of the elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augus shook his head in grief and shouted loudly to the dwarfs who were stunned: "Is it a fight to fight, killing a bloody road? Or numbly Death in the land? Look at your own choices!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam first!" The dwarves picked up the giant axe around them and shouted loudly, for a while, full War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tess licked her mouth and said with disappointment: "It’s really boring, Galata, hands-on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Galata sorted out the bow tie, turned a blind eye to the dwarf who rushed over the giant axe, and turned and shouted: "Follow your instructions, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A huge axe will cut his back. Suddenly, his right foot smashed into a ghostly afterimage, and he wandered around the dwarf, his left hand became a claw and pulled forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf made a scream of screaming, and then the voice disappeared like a plug of saliva, rolled up and down, after a few moments, his legs slammed, no more Can't move, the blood in the throat is berthing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he turned into the dwarf, and the figure kept going, and there was a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs were so close to him by the number of people, but he sneaked into countless small bats, flew away and regrouped in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he couldn't beat Galata, and the guards of Wells and Edith did not have the strength of a formal knight, the elders reluctantly said: "Crash to the door! Escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven or eight dwarves glanced at each other and shouted, dragging Galata and using life for other dwarves to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every ten seconds, there was a scream in them that seemed to be delayed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gively glanced at these dwarfs, the rest of the dwarf rushed to the door with tears, and completely rushed the lines of Wells and Edith. Into the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waste!" Tess said coldly at the entrance to the passage. She was born with two delicate white teeth and then her right hand. With a wave, a black gas will rush to the dwarves in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! The sharp screams came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gas dissipated, and the dwarfs in the forefront were all overwhelmed and pale, as if the blood was drained in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the dwarves only feel fear into the brain, scared to run away, but no matter how they run, they dare not approach Tess within one meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vampires can be more than just melee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is it so strong?" The elders, Harold, Mirna and other rear-streeters whispered to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the elders have been sober, knowing that the rebel army can’t compete with high-ranking vampires, but did not expect this ordinary or intermediate vampire to slaughter the Rebels Slaughtering cattle and sheep is also easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our efforts, our hard work, our sacrifice, have no effect at all?" The elders had a soft leg and stumbled over the altar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tess did not continue to use dark magic, took out the nightingale handkerchief and wiped his hands: "Do you still understand? You can survive because other blood races Too boring, want to play the game of cat and mouse. If you don't hope, you won't be disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The elders shed turbid tears In the head, the "dwarf family will never have a way out? Can the sacrificial people change a little light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and was The altar is crying and hitting the ground: "The god of steam, the master of omnipotence, the ruler of life and death, please save your Dai!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The screams of a dwarf around them sounded one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up, do you think there will be gods to help you?" Tess sneered. "Thousands of years, or tens of thousands of years, you guys." Is the dwarf family so naive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders are completely trapped in their own world, while mourning the name of the gods, while constantly hitting the altar with their heads, The blood stained the stone surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, this group of idiots." Wells finally eased from the impact of the dwarf, could not help but sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold, Mirna and other dwarves see fewer and fewer families able to stand, Galata seems to be an invincible slaughter machine, but also desperately kneel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Rebel Army finished like this? The hope of the dwarfs will never appear?" Harold thought painfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a flash of light flashed in his eyes, the subconscious raised his head, and his expression solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar, the altar that had not responded before, even raised a layer of sacred and solemn mask! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light and the faint light are constantly shining around! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief coagulation, ecstasy, gratitude and other emotions come to mind, Harold shed tears on the ground:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great life and death dominate, you love us, just as you have the highest authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
