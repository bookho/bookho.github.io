			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Dear Mr. Peter, I am delighted that your member of the Vladimir family came to Ural City to be a guest, just as the blizzard stopped and the weather was fine. Therefore, I would like to invite the nobility in the city to hold a winter safari in the forest of my estate to celebrate the coming of spring and welcome guests who are far away. I wonder if I am honored to invite you?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carlina? Lotnoff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a delicate and beautiful invitation, the paper is hard Delicate, printed with blossoming to the hollyhock pattern. The above is written with Shuai Lanwen, which is different from the lingua franca, with a faint sweet fragrance. When reading it, it seems that a mature and beautiful lady is coming. A picture of a feather pen carefully written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Baroness Carlyle..." Lucien heard the name from the Sergei mouth of the suspected fraudster at noon, and received it. Her invitation, although not afraid of fraudulent gangs by her own strength, still seems a bit hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch, the members of the caravans, such as Berf and Lena, who had a chat with Lucien, saw Lu Xi’an’s silence after reading the invitation, curiously asked Road: "Mr. Peter, is the invitation of a nobleman in Ula City? Oh, on this road, if you don't have your aristocratic status, how can we arrive in the Ural City so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar invitation, Lucien received it many times. Many lords heard that after the members of the Vladimir family came to their own territories, they would invite him to be a guest based on curiosity and friendship. Lu Xien kept a normal etiquette and etiquette in order to be unobtrusive. The enthusiasm of communication, basically will be happy to feast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these lords know that "Peter" is only the son of the Lord and has not yet been able to inherit the title, the attitude tends to become cold and unusual, but theirs The invitation allowed Lucien and the four or five caravans he joined in front and back to be spared many martyrdoms and successfully passed through the Shahran Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is an invitation from Baroline Carlyle." The Shahran Empire is a vast territory with a total of twenty-three provinces and hundreds of states, each with There are many aristocrats, so Lucien only knows more about the Ural lord, the Count of Viter. It is difficult to find out the little aristocrats like the Baroness. At this time, they can honestly answer the questions of the children. They want to get from them. These merchants who have been doing business in the province of Kinov all year round know the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking Black Metz at noon, Biel’s face was ruddy and his nose was brighter. He laughed: “It turned out to be Baroline Carlyle. Mr. Peter, she is a famous beauty in the Ural region, and she is still a widow. She inherits the title and rich property of Baron Lotnikov. I don’t know how many nobles want to get her favor, and earn the title, manor and beauty together. In the pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drunken look and eyes are unusual, seemingly suggesting that Lucien has gone for a peach blossom, maybe he can taste the beauty, even further The land is beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s always small, most men are always in a position to talk about similar topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blonde girl in the caravan, Irina, added a bit of sullenness: "The Baroness Carlyle is called the 'Black Widow' among the nobility. 'And 'the fox who admires the vanity', because she is a noble family, and is the niece of the second wife of the Earl, but for the title and property of Baron Lotnik, she abandoned many nobles who pursued her. Married to this full-fledged coward, who is 46 years old and has no heirs. In less than five years, Baron Lotnik, who is still healthy, became aging and sick, and soon became the Lord's call. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the deity called Carlylena as a female baron, people in the Ural state are still used to calling her a baroness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irina, don't talk about these rumors." A more stable gentleman in the caravan reminded me seriously that this is not a pub, not a wilderness. It is a high-class hotel in the Ural City, and the aristocrats of the Shahran Empire are much more brutal and barbaric than the areas ruled by the Southern Church. In private gatherings, it is said that the aristocratic bad words are punished by the whips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berf waved his hand: "It doesn't matter, there is no acquiescence from the nobles, how can the Baron Carlyle's things spread everywhere? They hope that this will Other competitors are scared. Anyway, for them, the character of the Baroness Carlylena, the reputation is not important, the important thing is the title, property and the wonderful body."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien smiled and said: "In any case, since the baroness invited, the caravan will have to wait a few days to leave. As a qualified aristocrat, you must not live up to the host's hospitality."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With aristocratic status, Lucien was able to reach the two provinces of the Vaolirit duly so smoothly, but due to the aristocratic status, many unnecessary entertainments had to participate. , there are advantages and disadvantages. Since the Baroness Carlyle also invited other nobles, this winter hunting should be no danger. As for the scam, as long as it does not greedy, it will not be deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his main purpose is to pass through the Shahran Empire, strictly speaking, also a liar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of several caravan members have become complicated, there are laughter and jokes, there are ridiculous things, there are little friends who are unhappy, and they are disdainful. Sure enough, you are the appearance of the hypocritical nobles I expected... Lucien sorted out his bottoms, smiled and said with a courtesy: "You, see you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; While saying that Lucien is closing the "Actor's Self-cultivation" opened in the Soul Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A piece of white earth, coniferous trees shake off the snow from time to time, and many mighty black Ural giant dogs roar in the snow Running west, the prey that replaced the gray-white long-haired rabbits came out of his hiding place, and they got rid of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a long arrow flew from a distance with a beautiful arc, and accurately shot a gray long-haired rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, there are applause in different places in the sparse forest, and a young aristocrat is pleased to say to the woman next to him: "Calilina, yours The archery has improved, and the rabbit so far can shoot so easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calilina proudly raised the bow and then Turning to Lu Xun Road: "Mr. Peter, the next time you show archery, the Vladimir family has a lot of archers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She is twenty-seven years old, with long blonde hair, a pair of blue eyes often with a smile, a slightly thicker lips but a red name, with a tight black safari, the whole person exudes a mature and charming The charm of the place, so that many young aristocrats around her eyes are filled with love and passion, is a rare stunner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, who has seen the true beauty of the beautiful, just looked at it with appreciation and politely replied: "Thank you, Mrs. Carlylena, your praise, God. The archers are the glory of the family. Oh, maybe my archery is not as good as you. After all, I am better at close combat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien pointed to the two long swords hanging, then picked up the longbow, aimed at the distance, and shot an arrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point of the bow and arrow is that the hand is steady and the eye is accurate. This has no problem for Lucien. After the long arrow flies out, it is penetrated by the cold wind. A rabbit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, you are too modest, this archery is close to the Cavaliers, can you teach me?" Carlylena blue twins Hui Li looked at Lucien with an obvious admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attitude attracted dissatisfaction from other young aristocrats, a black-haired aristocrat picked up the longbow: "Calilina, he is just close to the knight's archery, I Let's take a look at the real Knight Archery!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, his bowstring shook, and the long arrow seemed to be wrapped in a red flame, just a short moment. Shot through a giant tree, the Kirov snow beast hiding behind the giant tree was shot to the ground, and it shot its eyes, without hurting the fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completion, he triumphantly turned to look at Lucien and Carlylena: "Peter, how? Of course, if you think you are stronger in swordsmanship If you can, we can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not speak, Carlyleina smiled and said: "Bal Shak, you this Extraordinary longbow is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a subtle sentence, Carlylena spent a lot of time talking to a group of young nobles to hunt and keep the atmosphere harmonious. warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the distant forest, two people in black cloaks watched Carlyina quietly, waiting for the young nobles to give love. When the objects offered more precious prey and scattered, the ordinary black people used a very ordinary voice: "Miyaka, you become a winter bear, and raided Calilina. Attention, the first must To fight empty, then attack the blond handsome aristocrat around her. After waiting for a while, let him hurt, you pretend to escape with difficulty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
