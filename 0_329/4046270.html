			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Divine calendar 819, end of January (starting month), noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky of the lead color is full of blue light, as if the blizzard that can cover the world has finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-dome unique style of the house is full of thick snow in front of it, and some even have half a person high, blocking the door. Then the inhabitants of the Shahran Empire turned out from the window and sipped the spirits while shovel the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mainly golden, yellowish, and pure black hair color, most of them are big and round. The young girls are generally good, but the aunts are very blessed. Many of them have their husbands two wide, often need a few strong men to promote the snowball, they can get it with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second floor of an elegant dark green hotel on the street, two young people are looking through the window at the lively scene, the beautiful girl with blond blue eyes I started to play with a smile: "I have never seen such a big snow in the Ural state, and the New Year has passed almost a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ural is a sand The province of Khlong, the Khlong Empire, is located in the southwestern part of the empire. It is separated from the northern fortress of the Vauritic Principality by two provinces. It is famous for its blacksmiths, ores and weapons, and provides logistic support for the Marinov defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the girl’s soft and beautiful face, and the bumps and wraps wrapped in the fire fox fur coat, the pale yellow hair around her is shaved The young man opened his mouth with some hesitation, and finally he said with courage: "Lena, you don't... Are you still very close to the Peter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Lenna turned his head in confusion: "Igor, is there any problem? Mr. Peter is a well-educated, well-informed, humorous gentleman who is very happy to chat with him."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to being happy, Lena’s mouth twitches gently, revealing a faint smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smile made Igor very uncomfortable. He hurriedly took a few steps in the same place, ignoring the grace, and the voice was a little too high: "Lena He is an aristocrat, and his wife will definitely be a descendant of the aristocracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lena's delicate eyebrows wrinkled slightly, a little unhappy: "This is What do I have to do? I am only a friend with Mr. Peter. Igor, can you not think about it? If Mr. Peter is here, he will talk to me about the blizzards in other places, and talk about the fun games related to heavy snow. It won't make me angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, Mr. Peter, Lena, can you not mention him?! Their nobles are hypocritical! Always maintain an elegant and solemn manner in front of everyone, but you can do anything bad in the dark, from the two long swords that he carries with him, from the courtesy of all the beautiful girls in the caravan. Polite, you can see that he is actually a frivolous, fancy guy. And he hasn’t motivated his blood, and sooner or later he will lose his nobility!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar conversation has been done several times between the two youngsters, Lena and Mr. Peter were still laughing and laughing, and there was no distance at all. Igor couldn’t help but surpass the turbulent feelings and spit out all the sour feelings hidden in his heart...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Igor sullenly said: "I care about you before mentioning these things, it will make you unhappy. Like him, this constant and elegant thoughtfulness can only show that he did not You put it in your heart, just want to lie to you, lie to you..." Although he is trying to stimulate blood, he always gets along with mercenaries and adventurers, and occasionally speaks rudely, but when he faces Lena, he still does not use swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenna’s face smashed down, and there were crystal tears in the blue eyes: “Igor, Mr. Peter is not the kind of person you imagine, There were two single beautiful girls in the team who tried to seduce him and they were rejected by him. Moreover, in your eyes, is it a person who is greedy for vanity and easy to deceive?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she turned her nose and turned away, went back to the room, and closed the door, leaving Igor annoyed and annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the corridor, the corner is also seen through the glass window to watch the snow outside the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, the etiquette of the Vladimir family is really good, and you are the most decent aristocrat I have ever seen in women." Wearing a grey coat The red-nose old man smiled and said that he was Lena’s father, Belf, a member of the caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the characteristics of the Vladimir family, Lucien's hair was dyed golden with a tree-derived juice, and the eyes turned dark blue through the spare invisible film. The whole person looked a lot of sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is to please the nobles, write to lie to the little girl, let them be willing to be the lover of the nobles." Biff said exaggeratedly, then Hehe laughed: "Mr. Peter, have lunch together? I still have a bottle of black mace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien retracted his right hand and shook his head "Mr. Belf, thank you for your kindness. I was hurt when I was traveling in the north. I can't drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Mr. Peter, this is you. The most glamorous place. Wine and fighting are the romance of men!” For more than a month, the old fox of Belf almost touched the temper of Lucien and was able to make jokes more relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shahran Empire is known as the kingdom of the knights, because they stimulate the blood to become a knight, the proportion is higher than the Vaurit duchy, the Holm kingdom, etc. Fifty, this can only be fought for hundreds of years when the power of the clergy is much weaker than that of the Southern Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes many adventurers believe that the hard environment helps to temper the will to fight and stimulate the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the restaurant with Belf, Lucien looked for a table in a secluded corner of the corner, while the old butler dressed Leo was meticulous The waiter is standing next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, when Lucien bowed his head and used a spoon to drink red cabbage sweet and sour soup, a middle-aged man wearing a black coat and a purple leather vest The followers came over. His pale yellow hair was brushed with thick oil and brushed back. His mouth was covered with thick cigars. His hands and fingers were wearing seven or eight gold rings with different gems. It was dazzling, as if it could brighten the eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Peter, is there anyone here? If not, mind if I sit here?" The sturdy middle-aged man asked warmly and politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked up and looked around at the restaurant. Seeing no space, he nodded. "No, Mr. Sergey, you can sit here." The snow was closed, and many passengers did not leave, causing the restaurant to be crowded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sergei joined the caravan in the last city five or six days ago. The destination is the Ural city, the capital of the Ural state. His surname is bold and generous, and he is generous. Good at talking, and getting familiar with most of the caravan in just a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ordering the Brin, frozen sea caviar, veal and kebabs, Sergei smiled without a trace: "Mr. Peter, after During these few days of travel, I found out that you are a true aristocrat with elegant grace, just like the Vladimir family, Count Kutuzov. I used to see him when he was doing business in the northwestern province of Falk. A few faces." He seems to be showing off the big guys he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cut a piece of fried chicken and smiled: "Uncle Kutuzov? Does his joint hurt when he encounters wet weather?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big man of the Vladimir family. Valentin naturally did not forget to mention it, and revealed his many privacys, such as the failure of the Knights’ ranks. Under the inability to heal the body, when the weather is wet, it will be very uncomfortable, just like ordinary people have arthritis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is still the same as the Earl," Sergei hit a haha, then transferred the topic without revealing the beginning, and began to mention other nobles he knew. We. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the name of a nobleman set off the image of the mysterious rich man with an amazing background and a broad friendship, Sergei sighed softly: "Pity has arrived in the Urals." City, I am going to bid farewell to Mr. Peter, your talented aristocratic friend. I met the Earl of Viter through the personal relationship of the Baroness Carlyle, and bought a newly explored gem mine. Mining is difficult, but the value is amazing, so many people are jealous, so for a long time in the future, I have to stay in the Ural City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The territory accounts for nearly half of the Ural state and is the actual controller of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowly chewed the chicken and waited for a few minutes before he asked: "What's amazing?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
