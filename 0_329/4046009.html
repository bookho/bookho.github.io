Well, the new book comes out, I hope everyone can promote more, click more More recommended, thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin glanced at Lucien, and walked slowly to the ruins of the Witch's hut with a special elegant rhythm. The voice was low and gentle: "Evil wizards always like it." Playing with the hearts and minds of good people, especially on the night of the silver moon, but the witch has not yet got the evil power of real horror, her magic can only affect one or two people."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien first heard the confusion until Benjamin finished, only to understand that he was explaining why he only heard the cry, and the nearby residents were still asleep, even Was awakened, listened carefully, and did not gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the opportunity to speak to Lucien, Benjamin extended his hands with white gloves and continued: "And I guarded the four churches, I have the Lord’s care, so I can hear this evil voice.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four guards walking forward and forth, after hearing this sentence, immediately draw on the chest With a cross, shouting in unison:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this shout Their spirits have become slightly more exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slum dwellers who are far from watching, also whispered: "The truth is forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they whispered: "This is the power of the gods, and it is worthy of being a distinguished pastor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the faint praise, Benjamin took The face of the unique arc became more solemn and solemn, slowly opening the hands with white gloves, and sending a weird short syllable in the mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Paso.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short and rushing syllables just ended, and the ruins of the entire cottage were covered with a faint white light, like the silver moon in the sky. Glittering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the white light shrouded, the ruin and the road to the road to the Westside of the broken wall, the demon blood red, the shape of a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the mysterious curse and the effect of the magical effect, Lucien is as shocked as the surrounding poor, feeling ups and downs, but they are more Intoxicated and feared, Lucien is fearful and mixed with longing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin put away his hands and gave orders to the guards in front of him: "Gary, that is the secret door, there is no magic trap, you go to open it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary’s chest is a bit, and the iron on his body is slamming: “Follow, Benjamin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Gary and another guard walked, Lucien, who was next to the ear, heard Benjamin whispering a curse: "The arrogance of the referee, the light will use the 'detect magic trap', Can't you learn to 'detect the secret door'? Hey, because it's just a magic apprentice, is it so sloppy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the instruction of the magic, Gary shows With his strong muscles, he broke the broken wall two or three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, another guard pulled out the long sword, and the big scorpion focused heavily on it, smashing an organ and letting the black hole at the corner be truly exposed. Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hole is not big, it can only accommodate one person, the wind blows, and brings a stench of smell from the hole. Benjamin frowned slightly and used it. The right hand of the white glove covered his nose and mouth, while Lucien was almost nausea and unconsciously stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary looked at the hole carefully and ran over: "This Benjamin, this secret passage is a sewer."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin wrinkled with golden eyebrows and looked at Gary, his mouth and nose seemed to be oppressed a little distorted, and the voice became low and boring: "OK?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Benjamin did not speak. As a noble and elegant pastor, as a member of the fascinating Lafati family who had been inherited for many years, when he thought of the dirty and stench in the sewer, he was uncomfortable and mastered the magic. The structure and the several magical techniques that construct the imprinted model in the soul do not have "purification". If you want to display it, you must rely on the mantra, gestures and casting materials. No one knows where the secret room is in the sewer. Going over requires a few purifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, it’s just a magic apprentice. With the holy emblem of truth, there is no problem." Benjamin thought too much, then he looked at the road. Sean, loose the right hand, the voice has once again become majestic and ease: "You and the witch are companions, the body must be contaminated with evil power, need to redeem, can wash, but your piety to the Lord touched me, I will My holy emblem lends you, once you can purify the power left by the evil witch, you can regain the Lord's care. Go, Lucien, do things for the Lord, the Lord's eyes will look at you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running to the church and leading Benjamin, Gary and others, Lucien relaxed a lot of mood, there are pastors, guards, remove the grievances, ghosts It should not be difficult, and it is harder, and it is not the ordinary person who has just recovered from this body. Therefore, when he heard Benjamin’s words, Lucien’s mind immediately squeaked: “He actually let me clean up the complaints. Spirit?! Me, I am just an ordinary person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s face full of surprises and resistance, Benjamin asked gently and slyly: “You, don’t you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Half a bit malicious, Lucien had a nap, sobered up, if the answer is not willing, it may become a body immediately, and promised to go, listening to Benjamin's meaning, seems to intend to lend the emblem to himself, and Most of the guards will follow two or three, to deal with the incomplete grievances left by a magic apprentice that Benjamin does not pay much attention to. The danger should not be too great<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether Benjamin is really disgusted by the dirty sewers and unwilling to go down, there is still another idea. It is not good for him to do this seemingly simple matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressing the hatred of the heart, Lucien laughed very stiffly and replied: "I am willing to serve the Lord."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin did not put Lucien’s stiffness on his heart, and the right hand took the holy emblem on his neck and handed it to Lucien: “This is the holy emblem of truth, wait for me. A 'blessing technique' will be applied to you. With it, you can concentrate more easily, and then cooperate with the mantra and use the spirit and fingers to communicate the holy emblem, which will stimulate the power of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien pressed his emotions, he was filled with curiosity about this holy emblem that could perform magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden emblem of the sacred emblem is engraved with a white cross with a faint glow. Around the cross, in the deep gold, many lines and circles are drawn. Patterns of triangles, squares, rectangles, etc., which are connected strangely and set off against the cross, appear mysterious and solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the holy emblem in his hand, Lucien immediately felt a warm and soft power coming in, soaking the whole body, even in the face of the deep night breeze. It is warm as if it is basking in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are two informal magical techniques in the Holy Emblem: Brightness and healing, three times a day, and three first-order magic: Holy Light shields, shining swords, and holy light strikes can only be used once a day. Well, you can hear their spells."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean has no way to retreat, he must go on, so the power of the magic is very important to him. The mantra taught by Benjamin is to study hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mantras are all short syllables, but the tone changes extremely vocal, and it takes a lot of spirit, and Lucien can barely make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin nodded invisibly and his right hand extended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time there is no mantra, a white light shrouds Lu Xien and slowly dissipates, making Lucien feel full of strength and unprecedented health. At the same time, the spirit is concentrated and sharp, and you can hear the voices farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The priest adult actually let Lucien go down and give him the holy emblem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you hear it? It is the mercy of the pastor, let Lucien go down and wash away the sins of his body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien had little common sense about the world, so after accepting the "Blessing", he was quietly waiting for Benjamin to perform "Blessing" for Gary and the other two guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin Benjamin has a blessing every time, about two to three seconds apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Benjamin looked at Lucien and others: "Paul is at the entrance to the secret road, Gary, Howson, Correa, three of you, Go with Lucien."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his expression became serious and he painted the cross on his chest: "May the glory of the Lord protect you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The truth is forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary and other three guards look a little excited and answer aloud, Lucien slowed down half a beat, answering no, not answering or not. Fortunately, Benjamin didn't care about this, and watched them four slowly walk into the secret passage connecting the sewers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other guards Paul, his voice is low, and he asks questions that have been doubtful for a long time: "What is Benjamin, why is he?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mantras, sacred emblems, and guards such as Gary and others can also stimulate the magic of the inside, but each time they are inspired, such as pastors, trainee pastors, or evil wizards, such as Benjamin. Let's slow down, but even so, it's better than the kid who doesn't even have a formal and complete workout. Benjamin is not willing to go down. He can hand over the holy emblem to Gary, Howson or Correa. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin looked at the entrance of the secret road, his right hand licked his nose and mouth, his voice was low and slight: "His mental strength is slightly higher than normal, better Inspire the magic in the Holy Emblem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But too old, no cultivation value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One enters the secret passage, mixed with the stench of countless kinds of flavors, Lu Xien can not help but retire twice . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are living in the Adejan district, the kid is so unsuitable for the smell of the sewer, it seems not as poor as I imagined, whether it is The city of the Holy Ghost, or Antiphre, the real poor people living in the sewers, not even in the ruined house," Correa, who entered the secret road in front of Lucien, satirically said that he had black hair and contours. Unlike Gary and Benjamin, the cheekbones are high and the cheeks are thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucine answered, follow Gary, who came in directly: "Quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correa shrugged his shoulders, closed his mouth, and took a few steps in a high-key lane, then jumped out of the sewers that extend in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien followed and jumped out, stepping on the wet and slippery, not knowing what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are everywhere, the surrounding walls are full of strange moss, they emit a faint glow, so that the entire sewer is not in complete darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary whispered the voice: "I, Howson, Correa are high-ranking knights, you pay attention when you use the holy emblem, etc. Danger, immediately summoned 'Glory Sword'." He has a golden beard, but every move is very calm, people feel peace of mind, in the four guards, faintly dominate the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Gary holds the long sword in his right hand, with a small round shield in his left hand, greets Hausen, Correa, Lucien, looking for ghosts. The place where the cry came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rossien, who has no common sense, laughs and laughs: "How do I know the strength of the high-ranking knight attendant?" But this kind of thing, Lucien I dare not ask Gary directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miserable, sad crying sounds more and more resounding in the narrow environment of the sewer. It seems that it is difficult to distinguish the specific position from all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the specially trained Garry and other guards, as well as their own mentally good Lucian, under the blessing of blessing, it is easy to distinguish The direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
