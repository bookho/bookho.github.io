			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memphis's "greedy" devil stunned and then laughed: "I just want to make things easier, in fact, no matter how angry you are." Indignation and anger are not hindering the occurrence of things. I have already said that when you want to take the star nucleus, your mind and spell defense open a gap from the inside, and it is no longer perfect." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way you will see the real ancient hell, see all the ancient devils!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It confessed to its greed without any disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the star nucleus that exudes a clear radiance, each facet reflects a figure, a humanoid monster with a head goat's horn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of thousands of projections suddenly jumped out, condensing a huge monster in midair, two eyes bright red, back wings, pale skin, silver overhead The white goat's horn is like the "silver-white master" Tiffettis who has fallen for many years! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its bright red eyes sigh with raging anger, hate everything in the world, and want to destroy everything completely, just like a deepest part of the world of the dead. The grievances have returned to the kingdom of the living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all you, blame you, or how perfect I am from the big cross-frame locks!" It snarls in a grudge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the resurrection method left by Tiffantidis, the "Lode of the Silver", was used by the "disgusting" devil. Now it is just "abomination". The carrier of the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, its aura of silver and white is spreading in all directions, which is the biggest feature of Memphis, which is distinguished from the "mysterious master", the master of Silent Hell. The legendary third-order big devil can use the "ice aura"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver-white ice of the oil painting spreads like a wave, the gray stone bricks freeze, the broken stone pillars freeze, the dark red soil freezes, and the air Also frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of freezing is not a solidification caused by ordinary low temperature, but a kind of decaying sleep from the inside, even a building with no vitality is also dyed a layer The color of death and tranquility is as if it is the eternal destination of the dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abomination" The devil is the most tempered devil, it is used to direct attacks, bursting into the inner hatred! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Avalanche of Ice" has just expanded, and the "Greek" of the "greed" devil has begun to use its own "Duke of Frost" extraordinary ability to cooperate with the offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this point, they heard the mechanical sound of ticking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dead country where there is no sound in the dead, this happy beating is so abrupt, so strange, but it is like the passing of time, so Normal, so ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time has stopped, the world has become quieter, and Lucien gave them a "luxury crack". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Lucien flashed far beyond the temple, his right hand half-closed, uplifted, the "atomic universe" emerged behind, and the explosion erupted The huge fireball is just near his right hand, and the hot heat distort the air, creating a phantom of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing yang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien did not manage the "star nucleus" "Whether it will be damaged in the fusion explosion, just see it, see its speciality, and you will not be white!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, you can't let "greed" blind your heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time stop effect disappears, "Eternal Blazing Sun" takes over everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple at the core and the two ancient devils were completely vaporized at that moment, and the distorted shadows were completely dispelled even if they were too late to be sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the heat and the light, the energy storm like a raging wind swells around, but when it comes to Lucien, it can only break that layer. The distorted "time and space" cannot affect Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the specialness of ancient hell, the mushroom cloud that rolled out brought a fascinating glamour while wearing a huge red. straw hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything subsided, there was only one huge hole in the temple, and “greed” and “disgust” lost their traces and breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?" Lucien snorted and flew over the pothole, seeing the bottom of the vitrified scroll with a clear "gem" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nucleus was not destroyed... Lucien showed his magic to check its condition and rule out any possible danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The feeling of pulling the surrounding space inward has disappeared. Perhaps it is the special ability of this space-time material that makes it effective against ultra-high temperatures. And the energy storm is only suffering from severe trauma, temporarily losing the ability to interfere and influence the outside world, but it is slowly recovering..." Lucien picked up this special star and put it into the reservoir. Bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien was about to leave the temple of disappearance, there was a sudden exclamation of laughter around him:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No use! You can't kill us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a gap in your heart, so you will see the real ancient Hell! Hell of the Seven Ancient Devils at the same time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this roaring and cheering, Lucien is slightly stunned, they also like "the ancient devil" This title? Actually, I am also using it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the ridicule and announcement of the ancient devils, Lucien identified the direction and flew to the remains of the ancient core of ancient hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took to fly. Lucien saw the palace built on top of the mountain. It was made of gold and fell in dark red. Under the glory of the last glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful investigation, Lucian fell to the front of the palace, pushed away the heavy door and walked into the dark and radiant interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided by Douglas and Rhein, the scenes here will vary according to each individual’s situation. It seems that the ancient devil has chosen the most entrant to fear. And the situation of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark corridor, a little candlelight swaying in the distance, bringing a dim light, as if the last lingering warmth in the world after death . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you go inside, the more and more candlelights, suddenly, there is a hall in front, there is a silver candlestick in the hall, and the ceiling is also hanging down. The retro chandeliers, therefore, the interior of this hall is brightly lit, brilliant and brilliant, like a white, so that Lu Xien can clearly see the scene inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a library! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a library full of bookshelves and full of books! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a library that is very similar to the Lucien Soul Library! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a scene of fear and fear..." Lucien laughed and smiled like a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not talking, walked quietly into the library and walked straight to the front of the largest bookcase:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "On the cycle between elemental surrogate and atomic weight** and predictions of some new elements";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distribution of energy in the blackbody spectrum";<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
