			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallen Hill, sitting next to Bahá'u'lláh, has a firm face and a right hand clenched into a fist. The milky white light is flowing quietly, apparently against the evil of God. Magician Lucien? Evans is very angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the reaction of both of them, Philippe Bell, the cardinal with a thick white beard, smiled and handed another briefing: "Ba Haola, Warren Hill, what you see is the first day's briefing, this is the second and third day. There is no need to care too much about Lucien Evans, just synthetic urea, are you guys? Do you think that this kind of substance that exists in dirty things such as feces is a living substance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several pope transformations, members of the Cardinal Group may Or less can understand the arcane thesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly took over the briefing in the hands of Philip Bell, the appearance is as rough as the giant red-haired Baha'u'llah read carefully, all of which are defined for urea. Discussion, discussion of the theory of human life mechanics, and apparently the reasons of the Necromancers prevailed, and the Arcanists who are good at elements could not present more powerful and reliable evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are not as serious as we think. This is the blessing of the Lord." Philip Bell painted the cross on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to read Bahá'u'lláh also nodded: "In fact, really should not use the dirty urea as a gift of God, this aspect The definition of us should also be perfected as soon as possible in the Holy Scriptures on the 'Life-giving theory'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we don't have to take great risks Send a devout watchman who is willing to be the Lord's glory and sacrifice everything to clear Lucien? Evans. Command the referees of several major parishes such as Holm and Colette to pay close attention to the movement of Lucien Evans. I will shoot again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallen Hill was sent here by the Pope to kill the evil wizard, but he also understands that in several countries such as Holm, The power of the Magic Council completely suppresses the church, unless the church can draw up the reinforcements of most cardinal members, so the Northern Church, the evil kingdom near the Dark Mountains, the dark creatures in the Dark Mountains, and the ancient heritage magicians There is a chance to enter. Therefore, after discovering that the Magic Council’s research on natural magic has hardly progressed, both Wallen Hill and Baha'u'llah agreed that Philippe Bell did not provoke a big incident, and prepared to make a small fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment of Lucian synthetic urea seems to throw a boulder in a gradually gradual situation, so that Valen Hill and Baha'u'llah are both devout The believers once again ignited the flaming flames that defended the Lord's majesty, and the ensuing changes extinguished their adventurous mood and continued to steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with Wallen Hill's suggestion, but this arcane genius rarely leaves Allinge and Rentatt before becoming a mid-level magician. There is basically no chance to clear him." Feili Bell is the most familiar member of the Cardinal Mission to understand the style of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a rapid knock on the door of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come in." Philip Bell has seen through the vast "eye of the gods" that the door is a pastor who expresses his sorrow. Drastic fluctuations seem to swallow him at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor opened the door and uncharacteristically did not salute the three big men, but eagerly said: "His Philippe Bell, this is the morning morning briefing They took great risks and sent them out in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stabilize your emotions, don't doubt the Lord, don't doubt the Lord's omnipotence." As if to soothe the soul, the priest’s sorrowful fear was calmed down a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept painting the cross on his chest and slowly stabilized the uncontrollable God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feili Bell has received a briefing with a bad premonition and looked at the first page with the most calm attitude:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Experiment on the synthesis of a fatty acid through a series of alchemy reactions using several non-living substances such as charcoal" - Felipe? Carneiro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introduction of this paper, Felipe proudly wrote directly: "Through this experiment, I think it can be said to all magicians that human life mechanics is thoroughly Exit the historical arena of arcane development!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His white beard's chin trembled with the sound of his voice. He seemed to want to go to the town of Sariva or Heidel City, Aringe and other places to purify Felipe. As for Lucien? Evans's "small" role and his "insignificant" experiment have been completely forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold and bold Bahá'u'lláh took the briefing and took a closer look. He hit a fierce punch on Filip Bell's desk, and the faint darkness Under the radiance of the light, the desk was completely annihilated, leaving no powder: "The mortal can see the field of God, this is the sorcerer who must be tried at all costs!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; If the Bahá'u'lláh is an epic knight, the power comes from the blood of God, and the current shake of faith has already made his soul hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First choice we want to confirm the true and false of this paper." Valensil did not go to the briefing, but said the cross calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a strong paper can make the church’s strong beliefs shake and self-destruct, the Magic Council has long produced countless fake papers to defeat each year. Enemy, basically every priest has the ability to complete the experiment according to the paper guidance - there are similar experimental vessels and divine arrays in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blocking this paper, you can't leak it to ordinary bishops and pastors in the same way as the Holy Light event." Philip Bell closed his eyes a little tired. "This is the test of the Lord to us. The devoutness of faith is reflected in this time. After finding loopholes in the experiment or other explanations, we will preach to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Feiliel, who has served as Cardinal of Holm Parish for nearly a hundred years, has experienced many shocks, so he has not lost control of his "sacred soul", has not lost control of the Holy Light, and has changed other people without facing similar shocks. The cardinal, perhaps after reading the paper, was burned by his own light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All glory belongs to the Lord, and the truth is forever!" Baha'u'llah, Warren Hill and the next priest prayed in unison and kept telling themselves. Even if non-living matter can synthesize fatty acids, it is from the omnipotence of the Lord, but the believers themselves cannot understand what the Lord's test is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prayer is over, Warren Hill sighs: "Bishop Felix Bell, I request to send a few devout vigils to assassinate Felipe. Have the opportunity to purify Lucien Evans, who will cause this thing, if not, then wait for the opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is devout The night watchman is because this is a task that has almost no return. Even with the help of a meticulous help, Fei Peipei is successfully assassinated. It is impossible to surround so many high-level magicians and mages in the vicinity. Survived, not to mention there are several big arcans there. The average, compiled night watchman is certainly not willing to sacrifice himself, forcing them to force them to vote for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This matter, you and Baha'u'llah are responsible for the arrangement, I contact the nobles, and let the churches increase their alert to prevent revenge from the Magic Council." Liber returned to calm and authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Menshak held the briefing in his hand, and the body of the human body couldn’t stand the impact and turned into carrion. But the soul flame in his eyes is still tenacious and not extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to see the debate over the elemental magician, what is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Human life mechanics is really wrong, it’s really wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even Felipe’s genius has abandoned it. He is too blind and arrogant, or is it really wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The experimental design looks fine, but I dare not verify it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men Shak suddenly mourned, his body squeaking, this is a manifestation of the refining of the flesh that can no longer be controlled:<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have studied in the past hundreds of years, has the magical strength of the past few hundred years been built on the wrong?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this life a mistake?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if wrong, why can I live for so long? Why can I turn into a lich? Why can you improve your magical power? ? Xi kinds of magic "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;A piece of carrion fell off, a white bone landed, and Menshak had only one white skull floating in the air, and the soul flame in both eyes burned it a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s finally stable, but I’m skeptical before, and Felipe’s experimental results are trustworthy, since he’s always insisting on human life mechanics. Guys can abandon the past cognition and get back on the road. Why can't I? The Necromancer magic has developed to the present, and has been overthrown three basic theories by myself, and every time I can get great development, why don't I accept it? Our Necromancer is a faction that can correct its own misperceptions and is full of vitality. What do I want to despair?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the evil elements of the magicians To overthrow the human body mechanics, it is corrected by the Necromancer himself that it seems to be more acceptable to Menshak, at least to make him feel that the road ahead is not desperate, at least let him understand that past learning is not just a mistake, human life mechanics is on the surface. It is common to the truth. What is needed now is to explore its essence, so it must abandon its wrong "look".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh, the brief turns to the second page, Now Pesor, Tina Dimos, Rogerio and other pale hands of the high-level evaluation of this experiment: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a great, Outstanding experiments, the genius of Felipe let us get rid of the mistakes of human life mechanics, indicating that we will step into a more correct and brighter path. "--Pesol.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is no doubt that Felipe is a true arcane genius, he will be shrouded in the head of our Necromancer I don't know how many years of dark clouds have blown away. Dear Necromancer, think about why you are stagnating, can't break through the difficulties, become a more powerful magician? That's because the foundation is wrong, we just have to correct it, the future will be more broad and flat! ”——蒂娜迪莫斯.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is an experiment of creating a surname, breaking a surname, an important surname, and subverting a surname. Felipe let us see To the spirit of the Necromancers to explore the mystery of life, let us accept the end of the theory of human life mechanics, because there are more broad and closer to the realm of the field! We cannot deny ourselves, we can accept our own mistakes, and we can explore new directions! ”——罗杰里奥.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One big man is very good at Felipe and Necromancer, and they are one-sided The Masters slowly accepted the fact that the theory of human life mechanics was overthrown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of authority!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Slightly less stubborn Necromancers, the meditation environment has begun to stabilize, but not everyone can abandon the past. Many extremely conservative Necromancers are exempt from the headshot death, but they continue to insist on it. The impact of human life mechanics, let them understand that their meditation environment has been riddled with holes, it is difficult to go further, so the hatred is concentrated on Felipe, this traitor!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Inside a magic tower in the city of Heidler, an elderly man wearing an ancient magical robes looked at the briefing in his hand and shouted in resentment: "This is impossible!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the bang of the bang came, his head was completely blasted, his body was unable to fall to the ground, and in the magic tower, a countless rare magic gems There was also a crack in the fate of the made, and then a voice of old grievances came out: "Fortunately, I knew through advance that Tralipe was close to success, or else I could not do it through the resurrection." Felipe, Rogerio, Professor, Lucien? Evans, I will not let you go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Felipe, who sits opposite Rogerio in the town of Sariva, tastes a red wine and looks at Heidler’s direction. The heart sneered: "Damn old guys, have you tasted this time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Morris, who arrived at the manor, sighed with disappointment: "Unfortunately, it is not the evidence that we have decided to surname, or the loss of the pale hand." It’s a heavy one. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also good, lest the strength of the parliament be greatly weakened." "Raven is more open-minded. He likes and insists on the truth. He is more satisfied that a wrong theory has been overthrown. Then he looks at Lucien: "Evans, I seriously ask you, you really don't know the human body." Life mechanics says, still do not know? Did you intentionally cause this thing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Mr. Ravendi. Lucien answered calmly and then took out the Holm crown ring that Natasha gave. "Before I came to the Magic Council, I completed the experiment." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
