			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of many arcans, Lavin, standing behind the experimental device, started the subject without any nonsense: "In the elves, dragons, humans In the legend of the Wisdom Race, the world was very similar at the beginning: lightning and thunder, volcanic eruptions, floods. Even the church we hate most, their description in the Holy Scriptures. When life matter can be artificially synthesized After the controversy, the 'partial' high-level arcane division of the elemental will was inspired to propose an idea. Why don't we simulate this kind of environment? Look at what happens in a natural environment?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sound was suppressed so low, everyone heard his hidden excitement. Felipe nodded thoughtfully: "High temperature, lightning, is there a natural production of methane, urea and other living materials, and the artificial synthesis in the experimental environment is extended to the natural environment? This can further overthrow the theory of human life mechanics, to the church The heavier blow is conceived by the professors or the elements of the high-level elements. Listening to the tone of the Lord Lavendi, seems to have succeeded in the experiment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lippe turned to look at Lucien and found that his expression was dignified and focused on his observations. It seemed that he was not very clear about the experimental content: "It should not be him. If there is such a decision on the surname, he has already thrown it out. How? Get me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other arcans have similar ideas, after all, the focus of this discussion is this, and Laven is directly instructed and thus inspired So they whispered and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of living substance will appear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methane? Many places where volcanic eruptions occur This kind of living matter is only caused by the decay of plants buried in the ground, and it is ejected along with the volcanic eruption."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a direct exclusion The disturbance of living things such as plants is produced in the most primitive natural environment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following arcuists talked a lot, and the waiters waiting for orders outside the main house door Nikola and Valent used all their strength to suppress their anger and keep their emotions steady without being sensed by high-level arcians. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "these damned evil magician blasphemous, we still have further to break into the field Felipe God everything is caused by this blasphemer! !! is his, he must purify "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; relying on special divine items repressed her two divine breath and strength like a real ordinary people, in The old Master Fern’s arrangement was mixed into the Saliva Manor for half a day in advance, waiting for the cold wind of the early spring with other waiters to sit next to the gate. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; only a few Mofaxuetu wait until their supervisor told, it can hold hot water, towels inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the two have not found the opportunity, they will see Lavindi on the platform, hear him introduce the situation of this experiment, almost can not control the anger of the heart The land is dedicated to the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quiet, please be quiet!" Lavin's loud voice stopped the whispering in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around the hall again, Laven continues: "Based on the analysis of the gas near the volcanic eruption, based on the analysis of the constituent elements of the living matter, we will Completely pure water, hydrogen, methane and ammonia are introduced into the interior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In which methane is burned with carbon through a hydrogen gas, artificially synthesized with the help of a catalyst ...and the proportion of the last injected gas was selected from a number of simultaneous control experiments we conducted at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Lavin's open alchemy array artificial preparation Ammonia and methane, the archer of Tina Dimos, Felipe and others began to understand what he wanted to produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment of artificially synthesizing methane can be taken as one of a series of evidences to overthrow the theory of human life mechanics. The performance of Lavin is like he is in the magic experiment. There are a few small things in the room that are not worth mentioning at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a quiet but full of doubtful atmosphere, Lavin is not flustered and synthesizing gas in a step-by-step manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Methane is really made of non-living matter, no longer just a rotting corpse and some bacterial life can produce..." After a while, witnessed After calmly mixing the newly prepared gas with hydrogen and introducing it into the glass bottle in the upper left corner of the experimental device, many Necromancers couldn’t help but sigh. In just over a week, many of their past ideas were It was relentlessly overthrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a rigorous attitude made the Arcanists more curious about the results, and then Lavendi directly injected the pure water produced by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into the glass bottle in the lower left corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the experimental environment and experimental materials are ready, they are common in the natural environment. Next, let's start the formal experiment." Open the magic array and let the electric spark appear in the glass bottle in the upper left corner. "This is simulated lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the simulation of the high temperature of the volcanic eruption. Flooding floods." Lavin first introduced, while inspiring the alchemy array around the glass bottle in the lower right corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he opened the conduit valve to allow the entire experimental device to communicate. The pure water in the glass bottle in the lower right corner evaporates at high temperature, passes through the conduit into the glass bottle in the upper left corner, meets the mixed gas, and is shrouded by the “lightning” that keeps on appearing. After a while, the naturally condensed water It is returned to the water-filled glass via the lower tube and other experimental devices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the loop appears completely, Lavin exits the platform and starts the surrounding magical array of protection: "This takes about a week. I will open the magic array. Also ask the Arcans to arrange their own unique magical mark around to prevent artificial interference during this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About a week? What? The Arcanists did not understand the meaning of this experiment at all. With the gold-rimmed glasses, the gentle and gentle Timothy said humorously: "Does a baby be born inside? So need to be pregnant for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this obvious joke, the Necromancers are not in the mind, the body is very complicated, even if it does not mention the problem of the soul, the complex life substance Not so easy to produce! This experiment is too simple, it is hard to imagine what advanced products can appear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s solemn jaw: “Yes, it takes about a week. During this time we just discussed the problem of alchemicals helping plants grow. This main house The rooms in the above four floors and the buildings in the back are enough for everyone to use, and please be able to supervise the objective operation of this magical reading."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People Rogerio et al. used the communication technique to ask for the requirements of Lavendi after the death of the nearby dead soul. They themselves were very curious about what the experiment that simulated the original environment could prove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essilion and Elstin, who are sitting next to Lucien, are interested in nature and primitive things, but they have little knowledge of magic experiments. I can't guess what this experiment to simulate the original natural environment wants to do, so curiosity overwhelmed, and asked Lu Xien: "Evans, the high-level arcane master of your elemental design designed this experiment to prove what ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to Mr. Ravendi's words, it may be to further overthrow the theory of human life mechanics and confirm that simple living things can also appear in the natural environment." En said the same speculations of other arcans, but enough to get rid of the two elves of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aylestin used to use her right index finger to rub her own pink lips when thinking. She is more aware of the huge gap between life and non-living body. But the discussions of the magicians in the past few days have made her a little shaken: "There seems to be a good appearance in the natural environment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original natural will There is no involvement of the gods?" Exxon wondered with the thoughts of the Druid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nikolay and Valent outside the main house are in a hurry, their plans are divided into two options, one is to enter the hall after being ordered and passed Around Felipe, there is a mortal mentality to do a Thunder strike, and the other is that if the old Master Fern can't create an opportunity for them to pass around Felipe, then wait for the discussion of the magicians to end. Lippe suddenly attacked when he came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this meeting has to last for a week! The longer the time, the easier it is for both of them to be discovered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only hope that Felipe is not arranged on several floors above the main house but in other buildings, so he will leave the hall when the evening comes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old mage, who is sitting in the front of the center of the hall, smiles and touches the white beard on his lips. If you can’t naturally have a chance, then come yourself. Create one, but it seems too late today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Now the experiment has entered the observation phase without the druids' natural magical skills, which takes about four to five months, so we discuss here in advance which alchemy materials are useful and how to simplify their alchemical reaction. Scale preparation and popularization. Next, Ivans shared with you the process of discovering the results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm applause sounded, at least in the minds of most Arcans If there is no Lucian accidentally hitting synthetic urea, Felipe will never think of overthrowing human life mechanics. Although his results determine the lack of surnames, there is no doubt worthy of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few cognitive worlds are confused and difficult to carry out effective meditation. The necromancer looked at Resin with a bit of resentment and walked on the road in front of the platform, but did not kill His impulse, after all, overthrew the life mechanics of the human body, said Felipe, and he had other people after he had the opportunity to teach him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cleared his throat and talked gently and gently about the experiment. The control experiments included Ellers and other elves and Thai The magicians such as Odor confirmed that there was no problem - although they falsified some of the data, they were changed back by reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the process of arcane research, when everyone applauded that Lucien would go down, Lucien made a gesture of depression. Signal the arcans to be quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone’s doubts, Lucien’s expression was serious and serious: “Through my arcane thesis and the circumstances of each experiment, I think everyone’s attention. At this point, these elements that have been proven to help plants grow must be contained in water-soluble alchemicals to be absorbed by plants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not obvious? The plant relies mainly on water and sunlight, so it can only be absorbed by it when it is dissolved in water. I think most arcists will think of this after the failure of the previous experiments, but you are ahead of Mr. Evans. The human life mechanics said that the arcane masters who are good at both the dead spirit and the elemental magic are slightly dissatisfied with the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xi’s delicate face reveals an indescribable smile: “Since it’s obvious, then I want to ask everyone why it’s only dissolved in the water. Are they absorbed? Why are the particulate matter suspended in the water? The plants do rely on water and sunlight, but there is no direct experiment to prove that the water is used here as a transport tool! An alchemical body before and after it dissolves into the water, Why is there such a big difference? On the last point, the Arcanists should have noticed similar phenomena in other magic experiments, but why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A series of reasons why the arcane masters are a little dizzy, but when you carefully recall the magic experiments you have done, you find that there are similar phenomena, such as the huge difference in the salt name between salt crystals and salt solution, but because these phenomena are too Common and common, it has become common sense, no one thinks about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing these questions, Lucien stepped down the platform and gave time to the arcane masters to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you started this again. I remember that after you confirmed the periodic table, you also asked a series of reasons, just like the habit of Douglas "Larry's chubby round face has a smile on his face. "You are amazed at the problem. This is the place I need to learn from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lucien had not had time to be polite, Timothy pushed his gold-rimmed glasses and joked: "Evans, I think there are several nicknames that are right for you, such as 'Love asked why Ivans', such as ' Questioner', what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not good, and the first nickname also contains the name." Lucien shakes his head from among them. Go through and go to the central position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy smiled and said: "What do you think Evans thinks is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "100,000 why..." Lucien sat down blankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ In the half-plane space, the storm master gently smiled: "There are so many problems." At the same time, I turned to look at the speaker of the Magic Council. Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the gaze of the storm, Douglas took his sight back from the experimental device. He just simulated the possible outcome of the experiment in his own meditation environment. The matter, then returned a questioning look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
