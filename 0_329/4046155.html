			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s low laughter did not attract the attention of others, because they have begun to eagerly discuss the famous musician Lucien? The newly created piano sonata of "The Moonlight" by Mr. Evans discusses the quiet, unconventional first movement, the noise is noisy and noisy, drowning all other abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Wise, it seems that you like the first movement of "Moonlight", why don't we go to the piano room and try to practice?" Caspar sees Let Wise be rude in the hall, so he was invited to go upstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise gently nodded and smiled: "Mr. Caspar, you are really good at understanding other people's wishes. I am now trying to practice this beautiful and soothing "Moonlight". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Wise's consent, the so-called "musicians" and musicians of the Katherine City Musicians Association immediately surrounded him on the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty apologetically smiled at Lucien: "Mr. Evans, I want to go and listen to Mr. Wise playing "Moonlight" and will not stay with you. Otherwise, you don't write a letter, go up and listen together, this is a rare opportunity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Evans, go listen together "Joanna and Simon hold hands, the same eager look." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and said: "For me, writing a letter is more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joanna and Betty sighed at the same time: "This is really regrettable." They began to think that Mr. Evans, as a knight of a princess, should have seen many outstanding musicians, so it was so calm to face Mr. Wise. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Simons hurriedly followed Wise to the stairs, Mars also apologized to Lucien: "Mr. Evans, huh, I am It is in line with my hearing that the famous musician Lucien Evans's "Moonlight" is very good, so I plan to go up and listen to the music while listening to Mr. Wise's performance. He is more than the science of Koster in the art of piano playing. Musician and musician. Mr. Evans, you write a good letter and hand it to Chris. I will arrange the following things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, please Mr. S. You." Lucian did not care to see Mars leave. Since there were no other tables and chairs in the hall, he stood directly at the counter and spread out the stationery, and began to write the ink here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisis looked at the stairs with disappointment and sighed helplessly: "Why should I stay here? Hey, missed Mr. Wise privately." Playing in the room." Then she fiddled and walked behind the counter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned a blind eye to her performance and seriously wrote on her stationery that she had traveled during the past two months, mainly focusing on scenery along the way and national customs. The monsters and robbers I met, and I wrote seven or eight pages before I stopped writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where so many pages of stationery, Lucien wrote the address of the John family on the front of the envelope, then set aside and continued to write the next one. Letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether, as long as Lucien signed and stamped the envelope, the Aalto Musicians Association would naturally send him to John’s house, which is the musician’s treatment. And if you don't sign or seal, this inexplicable, the only thing that the recipient is not the insider's letter is the trash can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second letter was sent to Natasha, who added different folk music to different places in the trip on the basis of the first one. So I wrote more than twenty pages, and Kliss, who was doing nothing, couldn’t help but frown: "This gentleman is really good at nonsense, and can write so many pages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp At the end of the writing, Lucien thought about it and added a smile with a smile: "Your priest is coming soon, but I am in another country, I can only bless one sentence in advance."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing this letter, Lucien wrote "Natasha Vaoliate" on the front, because she did not need an address, the association The Othello Council is very happy to take this opportunity to visit Latava Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to spread the letter, Lucien begins to write a third letter, this is not for other friends - they can see the first from John The letter was prepared to be sent to President Christopher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing a few letterheads, Lucien still struggled to write a book. Very boring and slightly curious, Chris couldn’t help but walk to the side, screaming that she would spell, recognize some words, and stretch her neck to peek at Lucien. The address of the two letters that were written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The purple lily area 154 John received ... do not know." Chris first read the obvious word to be several times the number, then look at the other One, "Natasha Vaoli, Natasha Vaoliit... Natasha Vaoli?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Is that Natasha Vaoli?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s name often appears in Music Review and Symphony Herald. Therefore, it is well known by the people of other national musicians associations, and the reputation of Vaolirit is very special, very rare, so Chris directly associates with the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does this gentleman have to do with Princess Vaolirit and the Countess of Violet?" The deep surprise and strong curiosity drove Chris to speculate. Lucien’s identity, “Wait, Mr. Mars called him Mr. Evans?! Mr. Lucien Evans?!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Name There are a lot of people in Evans. Chris has seen more than ten people in Coser City. The name is Lucien. It is not uncommon, and the combination of the two is ordinary, but with Princess Vaoliette and the Countess of Violet. There is only one Mr. Evans who can be connected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crisis's pink mouth is round and close, and there are countless voices in his heart shouting: "Is he the Lucien?" Mr. Evans?! My favorite musician?!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps move a little bit, and Chris slowly writes to the feather pen. Lu Xien moved next to him and planned to peek at the contents of his letter paper to determine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved cautiously, moved for three seconds, stretched her neck, rubbed her eyes, and observed whether Lucien found out, like a thief, that Cautious, curious, and looking forward are very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Lucine’s mental power and intuition not find out the secret tricks of Klis, slightly feel funny, think of himself, etc. Zhang, so did not stop her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Wise, you have mastered the first movement of "Moonlight" just a few times, it is really a musical genius." Caspar loudly The praise came from the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty’s sweet voice followed: “The play of Mr. Wise is not a skill, but a wonderful. The delicate and soft melody completely touches our hearts.” She doesn't know much about music, and it's just a few compliments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise smiled: "It’s Mr. Lucian? Evans’s music is so good and moving, I can fully realize my potential, actually I It’s just getting started on the music and piano path.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are already a great musician, huh, Mr. Evans only wrote the first movement. Mr. Wise, would you like to try to create the two movements behind? Look at what is different from Mr. Evans himself.” Caspar is a broken aristocrat who has limited musical talents and can only rely on relationships. The ordinary city of Kesser City is a council member. Facing the famous Wise in the country is a very feminine thing. If you can know one or two big aristocrats through him, then there is hope for the restoration of the title. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wise is gentle and gentle: "Every piece of music has its own creative ideas. I forcibly write it, it is difficult to get along with the first movement." And, Mr. Casper, don’t mention this again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Mr. Wise, you are too modest." Caspar and others The man said together, then he walked to the hall with Wise and pointed out, "I have already prepared a villa for Mr. Wise, so that you can prepare for the concert."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your arrangement is always in line with my wishes, thank you, Mr. Casper." Wise did not refuse, and the group went to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Chris, who had no interest in Wise, finally moved to Lucian and secretly looked at what he wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complicated staves instantly stunned Chris’s eyes, and she couldn’t help but slightly sharply said: “Lu Xien, Lucien Evans "The voice is excited and surprised and looks a bit stuttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
