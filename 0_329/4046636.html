			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprint doesn't agree with Annick's statement: "The teacher should focus on improving the level of magic, and strive to promote the 9th Ring as soon as possible, and wait until the 9th Ring. I believe that the parliament must have all sorts of weird rituals to help him become a legendary magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to rely on rituals to improve two big levels, there are percent More than 80% of the possible failures, so Sprint believes that if the teacher wants to enter the legendary field in the shortest time, the best choice is to rely on himself and the pharmacy to assist in the advancement of the Nine Rings. As for the Nine Rings, can it be successfully promoted? Sprint has no doubts, a legendary career with perfect flaws and his own cognitive world, and is engraved in the cognitive world. It can be directly integrated into the soul's legendary spell model during rituals. There are many legendary magicians' experience and help. The teacher will never fail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you are right." Annick did not insist on this issue. "The number of times the teacher recently came to the atomic research institute seems to have decreased significantly." It should be focused on improving one's strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this appearance, in recent months, their burden has been reduced a lot, in addition to continuing to learn Beyond the two relativities, there is only the task of analyzing the principle of the "assisted computing matrix". The test questions and exercises have not appeared new, which makes them seem a little missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review of the paper, because Lucien has become a member of the highest jury, automatically dismissed the members of the Arcane Review Committee, they no longer bear - The Arcane Review Board also maintains a rule that if the paper identifying the surname is subverted, it can be handed over to the storm to rule the Lord, Lord Evans, or the Arcane Master in the opposite field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprint took over the journal that Annick bought back, and looked at the catalog of Magic, and suddenly saw a long-standing paper: "spectrum splitting complex in a weak magnetic field with the new model of contradiction alchemy", author: Brooke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six months, they have been working hard to mend the new alchemy model, although most of the hypotheses and repair ideas put forward by Hathaway and Lavin The first, Joaquim and others refuted the meaninglessness, but the arguments with the Arcanists and the high-level Arcanists still made them greatly, far more than in previous years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that they didn’t learn anything under the guidance of Lucien, but in this way they gave Lucian’s knowledge The practice, the experiment that I usually do, the various novel ideas in my mind are really merged together, and I have made great progress in my own things, becoming a veritable young man who is expected to become a high-level arcane master, not a A vase brought by the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as soon as I saw this topic, Sprint’s face became dignified and quickly turned to the page number corresponding to Magic, and read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, this, how can this split phenomenon, the current quantified model of new alchemy does not seem to explain..." I don't know how long it took, Plint’s face was black and talking to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, new alchemy is not perfect enough. Everyone knows that the magicians who use it to build their own cognitive world are concentrated in protons, neutrons, and electronics. The simple structure, does not involve specific energy level orbits, etc., he did not know the world shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick next to him heard his self-talk, and also took the "magic" solemnly, and Sprint took a deep breath, big Step into the magic lab in the villa to verify the things described in this paper. The teacher said that in the arcane, even the Arcanist can not fully believe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick looked at it, the cold sweat on his forehead ran out, and the slightly thin face became paler, and found that his current knowledge and ideas could not be explained. this phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the new alchemy really have a big problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand holds the journal tightly, and Annick also entered the magic lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was about to light up, the two men came out of their respective labs and looked at each other and saw each other’s bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basic framework of the new alchemy is definitely right." Sprint emphasized to himself that protons, neutrons, electronics, and teachers were named The basic strength of strong nuclear power has been confirmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half-year repeated disputes and research, they also understand that some things should be given up when they give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the strength of young people in this area, and wants to immerse those decades, decades, and hundreds of years in a theory or model. It is obviously unlikely that the surgeon will suddenly give up his persistence and good at it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will try again to solve the problem with energy levels and orbits with pre-additional assumptions and preconditions. If not, slowly explore other things. "Study." Sprint said seriously. "When the New Year holiday is over, ask the teacher. He must have an unusual idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new alchemy In the discussion and disputes, they can feel their remarkable growth every month. Whenever they meet monthly, they will find that the gap between them and their teachers is not small but bigger, each of their own. In doubt, the teacher can give a certain answer from a reasonable angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Annick seems to have forgotten to sleep, walking to the study with the ruby ​​"Magic" journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene also happened in the villas of Katrina, Heidi, etc., also occurred in Hathaway, Morris, Ravendi, and Stone is in the magic tower of the upper arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in "Thunder and Hell", Fernando is a violent face, so that students who come to congratulate the Happy New Year, such as soup, Chloe and other students become cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, Happy New Year." The score of the spell's arcane level has reached level 7, which indicates that he hopes to hit the nine ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stared at them and almost roared: "I am not good at all! I can't understand Brook's abnormal splitting!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Brooke discovered this phenomenon, he first looked for a paper he discussed and later wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe with poetry temperament: "What paper? Teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He It is the authority of the field of heat. Although the level of arcane and magic is not as good as that of Lucien, it is already eight-level and eight-ring. But Brooke’s paper has just passed the review for a few days, and he still has no content. "Magic" has not been bought yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't give me that damn essay! I would rather be a poet, a playwright, a playboy, so I don't have to think about this damn paper! Fernando used his gestures to strengthen his tone, bursting with the violent feelings in his heart, Soup, Lacey? Carter, Asikana and others all squinted slightly, sideways, as if the sailboat sailing on the sea encountered a horrible hurricane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum quickly shifted the topic: "Teacher, why didn't Lucien come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He and Affis have arrived earlier than you, have left." Fernando's emotions calmed down a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe is curious and said: "What does he think of this paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the voice just fell, he felt the burning indignation of the soup and other people, and suddenly understood that he had asked questions that should not be asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s expression is once again distorted: “He also acknowledged that the energy level and orbital model of the new alchemy had a big problem, and that it would be necessary to introduce a new quantum number to explain it. But his original system had no way to do this, I would rather he never proposed a new alchemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar is like a storm, Chloe I regretted my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diyep left the teacher’s study, full of abnormal lines of the line and the teacher frowning, keeping the draft . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher's preparation for the promotion of the legend has almost been completed, and this time should not focus on other issues." Dieppe thought worried, he is Lavendi The highest one of all students' abilities and magic level is already a six-level seven-ring. Although it is not a younger generation such as Lucien, Felipe, Larry, etc., he can compare with other magicians. Obviously young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
