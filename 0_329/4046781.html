			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the nobility, the night winds are blowing, and the evergreen trees are rustling. !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the trees, there is a two-storey villa with a half-dome, which is bold and bold, and has the characteristics of the Shahran Empire. However, I don’t know why. This villa looks very gloomy in the dark, like a sly monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the villa from afar, Katrina couldn’t tell if this was his true "star of destiny" hunch, or from psychological effects, as if it were integrated The shadows of the surrounding cold winds are getting weaker and lighter and disappearing without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although things have passed for a few months, and the villas have been cleaned with the Holy Light, the warnings should have been withdrawn, but Katrina is not willing to care. Still using "high stealth" and other spells, instead of relying solely on the strength of the Cavaliers - she trusts and loves magic more than blood power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds did not obscure the silver moon, the faint light sprinkled on the ground, letting the trees drag out a long shadow, like a twisted monster, Catri On such a bright night, Na was quietly approaching the villa. The effect of "high invisibility" left her with no trace. Even if a carriage that passed the night road passed by her, she was not aware of the recent There is a lady in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina entered the villa very easily, then gasified into the hall and began to carefully check the "discovery site." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hall is covered with smooth, dark-colored stone bricks, which are the same style as the Shahran Empire, and are so huge that one is topped by Allinge. Five blocks of pattern tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the ceiling of these dark stone tiles, Katrina has a feeling of inlaid with a mirror on the floor, and my heart secretly said: "Even In the residence of the Earl of Calcut, the tiles will not be so smooth, and they will not be dark. This is nothing but the wrestling of the guests wearing pointed shoes. Is the owner of the villa specially designed for this purpose? Or is there another idea?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats of the Shahran Empire have always been more arrogant than the “peer” in the south Katrina did not dare to rashly rule out this possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "Higher Invisibility" - Every time you cast a spell, you will see the body, but after you cast the magic, you will return to the invisible, so the surface of the dark stone brick Katrina's changing appearance is constantly flashing, and the long blond hair and green eyes are all clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a few months after being cleaned by the Holy Light, and then the magical magic seems to have no effect.············· I have shown all the prophetic investigations of magic that I can think of, but I can't harvest them. I can only stand in the same place and smile and laugh at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, she is not without any gains. At least the traces of the long swords, daggers, etc. on the floor tiles can be judged by one thing. That is At that time, no one really showed extraordinary power, otherwise they would not be so shallow, and there was no difference between the traces caused by an ordinary person throwing a long sword on the floor tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The use of extraordinary power can only explain two possibilities. Either the official magician is completely controlled by the demon, or his power is sealed in advance. If it is the former, in the absence of reason, only the killing and destroying desires will not be able to use the magic that he is best at and the most lethal, so whether or not he worships the devil, it should be sealed at that time. Katrina did a simple inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the magician took part in this killing feast because he wanted to reach a certain wish, and he controlled himself without using magic. That was the most dangerous moment. Any wish can't be compared to its own safety. Under the subconscious, he will definitely use the spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, from the body of the magician, I can figure out how his magic was sealed..." Katrina thought of a clue. The right hand was swiftly and annoyed. "But the magician was identified by the church as the initiator of the admiration of the demon event, and his body was burned on the firearm, and the damn church."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always Sven’s politeness, she couldn’t help but burst into a foul language. This kind of thing happened. The Northern Church certainly wanted to find a culprit to appease the nobility and the people, just to die at the scene. An evil magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she seized the clue, she looked a little uplifted and checked the upstairs and basement again. Unfortunately, she did not gain anything. Just as she was about to leave, she suddenly felt that the alert spell was touched, so she turned her head and looked Windows in the direction of the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Katrina found that the familiar knight would blow in from the window gap like a cold wind, cold and carefully explore the situation inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this will spread to Katrina, her "high stealth" effect produced a burst of flaws, perfectly forging the signs of no one here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kakaka, even after a very slight sound in the quiet night, the window slowly opened back, and a thin piece of ice quickly melted into The water droplets, soon, the "murderer" who opened the window disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow drilled in, tall and strong, with a snow-like pattern on his hands<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yakov, he really came..." Katrina stood in the middle of the hall, quietly watching the figure moving around and checking, from the familiar atmosphere, she is not difficult to judge the identity of the other party . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she didn’t feel too surprised that Yakov appeared here. When Anna mentioned the dead magician, he was a bit abnormal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov looked around and confirmed that there were no items and suspicious traces, and finally he was relieved, but he never found Carter standing behind him. Rina, even if she stood so bright and big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wanted to think about how to ask him. If you run into it, don't waste your chance..." Katrina's green eyes flashed a bit, and there was The decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yakov is straight up and ready to look up to the room upstairs. Suddenly, he feels a sense of uncomfortableness in his heart! Come from the mercenary for many years The experience made him start to go to the body without thinking! The whole body was entwined with frost. At the same time, his heart was shocked and thought inexplicably thinking, "Is there an ambush?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idea From the beginning, his head suddenly slammed, and his eyes became vague, as if he had fallen into a fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a question to ask you." Then he heard a voice that was fascinating with men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is weird, but in the heart of Yakov, I feel that this voice is so familiar, so sublime is like the Lord who worships in the weekdays, and like the heart of himself. The girl who secretly loves, so there is no resistance to appreciatively: "What problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your relationship with the magician who died here? Why did you come to investigate?" The voice continued to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question pokes the fear in the heart of Yakov, and the subconscious refuses to answer, but the inexplicable state of surrender worship makes him irresistible, or Frankly replied: "At the beginning of May, I happened to meet a formal magician and worked with him for a period of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I give He provided intelligence and led him to the plains to find various resources. He gave me some information to stimulate the blood. Based on this information, I corrected some of the mistakes of the past and found the way to become a formal knight. Then I led the mercenaries. The squad accepted another mission. After returning to the icefield, I heard that the magician was involved in the admiration of the demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of worry about his affairs When I was involved, I was facing the critical moment of the seal, so I was so worried that I came to search and planned to destroy all the remaining clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina愣Hey: "Why does his business involve you? When he was working with you, he was alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official magician is dead, and there must be no items such as Yakoff’s tokens on his body, otherwise When he returns to Calcutt, he will be asked by the church to "question". What is he worried about? There is no clue as to this kind of temporary cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, only he is alone." Yakoff is just as honestly answering his loyal lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
