Although he knew that he would become a formal magician, he would get a lot of income. But before he was in school, many subsidies were directly allocated arcane points, basically no cash. Trading, so, after hearing the offer of ten Queen's gold coins, I couldn't help but speed up my heartbeat and swallowed a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten Queen’s gold coins are nothing to the nobility, the wealthy big businessman and the magician, but Downey was born in a civilian family in the town. I haven’t seen a gold coin until now, and just go for a trip. I don’t need to solve the problem really, I can harvest a lot of wealth that can improve his family environment. How can it not be awkward? Heartbeat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to continue the path of the magician, materials, scrolls, books, extraordinary items, etc. are inseparable things, and they all need the support of wealth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem is solved, how much will the Baron Herdos pay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s thoughts rolled and his voice became slightly hoarse: “If I can solve this problem, how much will the Baron give me?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward looks the same, does not ridicule Downey’s self-discipline, knowing that there was a three-ring magician before, but failed to solve the problem, his attitude is respectful: "My master said that if Mr. White can restore the tranquility of the castle, in addition to the ten Queen's gold coins, you will be given a 'Magic Glove', which is a second-class extraordinary item."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extraordinary items? Downey only felt the blood rushing, and almost immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the long-term meditation and spell-casting practice kept him in the last line of waking, calm and serene: "The Baron Herdos is the lord of the town. I am very happy to be able to help him, but I need the previous masters and apprentices to handle the record of the castle's spiritual events. If you are sure, I will go to the castle in person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing is a little more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper’s respectful face showed a smile, and a thick stack of documents was taken from his arms: “This is the record you need.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling Downey’s surprise, he smiled and explained: “My master is no stranger to the magician, so I know you will need this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey was relieved, took the record, showed the spell and saw that there was no trace of tampering, and then read it carefully. After a long time, he rubbed his papers and said calmly: "It’s just that the two apprentices were so surprised that they jumped out of the old castle window and fell to the place." There is no record of the death of the Master. Well, for me, there should be no danger. Mr. Housekeeper, please take me to see the Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He in front of him The second sentence is not for the butler, but for the parents and sister, lest they worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after hearing his explanation, Lily and Mrs. White, who were worried about what they wanted to stop, sighed with relief and emerged from their inner smiles. The son (brother) can be valued by the lord of the Lord. This is the glory of his own family. It was the right choice to choose him to go to the general school! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As civilians, their fear and obedience to the lord is better than to ordinary magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey’s father, Old White, nodded with excitement and let Downey, despite going, didn’t have to worry about the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills near the town are undulating, covered with evergreen trees A dark and deep castle stands beside a beautiful quiet lake, which complements the surrounding scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old castle, Downey and the baron of Herdes, who was sallow and coughing, sat on the sofa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the castle that our family has inherited for 900 years. It is a symbol of our family, but the haunted phenomenon of recent decades has made us No peace, I hope that Mr. White can help you solve it. You are a professional of the Necromancer." Baron Herdos said weakly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Downey is a necromancer in the direction of "body structure and genetic factors", the knowledge of ghosts and evil spirits is a compulsory course for Heidler College, so it is no stranger to this, and asks dignifiedly: "I don't know dozens What happened before the year before, which led to haunting? I hope you can tell me all, don't miss it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden appearance of haunting is certainly not without cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really not, the previous few magicians have asked." Baron Herdos answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician he had requested before was not a professional of the Necromancer, but since it was to solve this problem, the necessary preliminary investigation would still be done - Unless you are crazy, no magician is a completely reckless guy, especially the current arcane master, clear thinking, logical clarity is the basic feature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a sudden appearance, perhaps who did what was secretly, but after so long, the clues have long been gone." Baron Herdos Added one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny nodded. "I hope that the baron will give me the family information for that period of time. All kinds of information will be there. I am staying here tonight. They 'send' time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come to Mr. Downey tonight." Baron Herdos slightly decapitated, after which he stayed on the table. Ten Queen's gold coins, left the castle with the butler and returned to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servants in the castle are coming during the day, leaving before the evening, no one dares to live here, so, with the departure of the Baron of Herzos The castle was restored to a deep and tranquil atmosphere, and the fire in the fireplace burned, but it could not dispel the deep cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey checked the castle for a while, nothing to gain, then found a bedroom, began to meditate, stay energized, and wait for the night to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! when! when! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bells rang, the old wall clock "gears" at 10 o'clock in the evening, and according to the information in the hands of Downey, all the haunted phenomena are this What happened after the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! boom! boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell just stopped, Downey heard a dull and strange voice, and frowned. This is the window that the wind blows constantly hits the window frame. sound? I have checked it before, and all the windows are closed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand rubbed the magician badge on the chest, Downey opened the door, entered the hallway, and walked toward the place where the sound was heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge and dull percussion sounded behind Donnie, scaring him to turn around and seeing that the door he had just left was automatically closed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜呜呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint illusion of crying is introduced into Downey’s ear, and his pores are shrunk. If there have been several real nightmares, he’s probably already Can't keep calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the wind whimpered and suddenly rang in the hallway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A candlestick went out, and the darkness completely enveloped the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey quickly applied a "lighting technique", and the glove immediately glowed like a torch, illuminating the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cold sigh of breath blew on Donnie’s neck, stabbing him cold hair, and then, “lighting” was silent. ended! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This evil spirit is more horrible than the description!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey "seeing" a nightmare Among the various undead creatures, the strength of this evil spirit is more clear than that of ordinary magicians. The heart has passed a trace of uneasiness, speeding up the pace and walking directly toward the castle gate. "It interrupted my spells and actually let me Nothing to know! How could the past few magicians survive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
