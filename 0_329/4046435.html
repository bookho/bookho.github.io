			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow is clear and the sun shines on the body, bringing a warm feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the heavy footsteps of the Iron Golem came from the corridor, pushed open the door, the eyes flashed red, the sound was metal-cold: "Master I have already received six similar papers submitted by the authors of the paper and the evaluation opinions of the audit committees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of being a member of the Arcane Review Committee. First, you can read the papers and evaluate the results without using the arcane point. Otherwise, it is ridiculous for a committee member to review the papers and spend the same time to exchange similar papers. It is not an attitude to encourage arcane research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking this thick stack of papers, Lucien waved the steel magic statue to the door and turned it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these papers, it is obvious that the author Levsky’s in-depth and perfection of the study of “anti-tower geometry” has recently arrived. At the time of the thesis, a new geometric system has been constructed, based on the assumption that the five axioms of the tower geometry, the four public works, and the “outside straight line, at least two straight lines can be parallel to the known straight line”. A new geometric system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think anyone has already derived Roche geometry..." Lucien said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This geometry is the first non-Euclidean geometry system on Earth, and the author is Lobachevsky, who made The hypothesis of at least two parallel lines and the deduction of a new geometric system is still a well-recognized young mathematician. But after he presented this research result, he was greeted by the indifference, scorn, and slander of a lifetime. He was ignored or accused by an authoritative mathematician. Even the "King of Mathematics" Gauss remained silent on the basis of recognition of Roche's geometry, fearing the dissatisfaction and opposition of the entire academic community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a desolate situation, Lobachevsky did not give up, and has been working hard to survive and develop for his new geometric ideas, one year before his death. Completed a work of geometry, but unfortunately, he did not wait for the dawn of death, died in depression and pain, blindness in both eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until his death for more than a decade, his new geometry was recognized by academics as another mathematician proved the realization of Roche geometry on special surfaces. Concerns and research have won a high evaluation of being late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of research seems to have no meaning for the current development of arcane, nor can it enhance the magical power, but in fact, the arcane and magic are explored again, stepping on When it comes to time and space, the universe, etc., current mathematical tools will face dilemmas and cannot accurately describe and help solve practical problems. At this time, mathematics needs to be developed and new tools are given. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, on the earth, another non-European geometry system that was established on the premise of "a point beyond the straight line and no straight line parallel to the known line" "Man Geometry" is the mathematical basis of the great general relativity to explain the space-time problem, and Roche geometry is applied in the study of the universe by humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the tower geometry (Euclidean geometry) is the human's intuitive experience and understanding of the world, then the two non-European geometry systems are close to objective Reality - In fact, the three geometric systems are only the difference in curvature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sighed, compared to the cognitive improvement, the magical world of the level of strength, currently used as a tool in the field of mathematics, rebellious, The theory of subversion is more demanding and more conservative, just like the assessment results they give:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ridiculous reasoning, getting ridiculous results, I want the author You should look up the window and see the real world... My opinion, the paper cannot be approved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is a erroneous paper , worthless, can't pass the review."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I think that for this kind of whimsy, no one can understand the nightmare, the best way is to It was thrown into the fireplace, which played its sole role. Obviously, it could not be approved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While watching, Lucien is shaking his head, although he has also encountered a situation in which the paper was given a lower rating. The criteria for evaluation and the tone of the words are common sense. They are “products” that do not understand the papers or can not verify the conclusions. If the results of the examinations of these papers are directly attacked or destroyed, or the papers are distorted. The content is accused, and there is no discussion on the matter. From the premise of the paper itself, deductive reasoning and logical contradictions, the duties of the audit committee are seriously shackled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bold assumptions, rigorous interpretation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A late evening Line was dyed with a golden aftertaste in the setting sun and sunset, unusual beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a towering magic tower, a white-browed old man wearing a "high tower" special gray pointed hat is frowning to calculate a mathematical problem, occupying most of the time. Several complex magical arrays of desks are lit up from time to time to assist him in the calculations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚, at this time, his assistant rang the door of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old man who seems to be sixty or seventy years old with an eight-level arcane master and seven-ring magician coat of arms is interrupted by his thoughts and temper Some violently authentic: "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His assistant is a beautiful and serious young lady wearing a conservative Holm style dress with a stack in her hand File: "Teacher, your secret puppet will send the papers received today, please dispatch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man screamed: "Show me Look." If it's not important or difficult, let the students help with the review. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful and indifferent young lady who has no expression on her face is not too big to move forward, putting several papers on the right hand side of the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the paper, the old man first looked at the subject, suddenly, he slammed the table and made a squeaking noise: "Levsky submitted again His imagination is geometric! The deacons of the Magician Management Department are all sleepwalking, and even let him submit it? Is it worthwhile for us to review the committee's time? I have to ask the committee to ban this paper from being submitted again!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Samantha, you changed it according to my previous review results and threw it back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a house in Aringe is known as the most complete flower category in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful lady with a hair-lifting hair throws the papers in her hand to the ground: "Levsky still does not give up? He is wasting himself The talent and life! This kind of look is the value of the submitted paper in the wrong paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, she picked up the paper and pulled out a special shape The beautiful feather pen, began to write the audit results, brush a few brushings, and it took less than two minutes to finish writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she angrily told the servant: "The dusk after two days is returned to the Audit Committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Let Levsky, who is stubborn, crazy and disgusting, hold hope for two more days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning the results of the review to the committee, Lucien smiled and took out Paper and pencil, start writing papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Lucien just stepped into the study of teacher Fernando and saw Douglas in a black evening gown and a kindly magical speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning, Lord Speaker." Lucien greeted with a puzzled voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and said: "I am very surprised to see me. I came to your teacher to discuss the two theories put forward in the recent "Arcane" and "Magic". It is the two that refute my experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this time, I really like to meet face-to-face with Fernando. Listening to his roaring these theories, my mood will change. It’s very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien almost stopped talking, and the Speaker of the House also has such a humorous side? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stunned and shook his head: "These worthless essays can even be published on "Arcane" and "Magic"! Although their style And the level has not been high, but it can't be reduced to this extent! What kind of charged particles will shorten the relative movement of the ether, so the measurement will be biased, and the result is not accurate. Does he use experiments to confirm this deviation?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
