			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal magic test tube contains solid, colorless things, exudes extreme cold, just watching, it seems that there is a feeling of blood freezing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mourning of the mantra, the magic test tube began to roll, as if it was about to break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling this scene, Rudolph II, who suppressed Natasha, shook his head gently, and said in his heart: "The biggest problem with this magic is..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It takes too long to display! And Natasha’s strength is still unable to entangle the king!” When the latter half of the idea appeared, Rudolf II The world combined with the flipping of the books behind, a slamming Natasha played a short stiff, then the wings behind, a fan, flashed in another direction, got rid of Lucien's mental power lock. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Rudolph II, who once witnessed the release of the "Wings of the Goddess of Ice and Snow", not see the pros and cons of this magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a snow-and-snow-like nine-ring magic that is very close to absolute zero, when it is displayed from the Archmage, it is indeed powerful and has no obvious weakness, but when passed When the material is released in advance, the lengthy spell, the casting time of three or four seconds is destined to not really threaten the Knights of the Sky and the Golden Knight, unless it is accompanied by a contract, or encounters that for various reasons. Lost the wise enemies of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just flashed out in the air, the holy angel wing behind Rudolph II was gently fanned, and the "purifying fire" sword in his hand was slanted and dragged, ready Continue to attack, do not give Lucian and Natasha a chance to breathe, otherwise Lucien, the high-level magician, uses one of the auxiliary magic to enhance Natasha's strength, weaken and interfere with himself, that "Daniel "This pseudo-golden knight may have the danger of failure - this is the power of a high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the two sides are deadlocked, drag on for too long, wait until Etna absorbs the "essence" fragments, or the half-god Lich Conggs resurrected, There is no chance for yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel wings behind Rudolph II have just moved, and the long and arduous curse of the road in the ear disappears inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, his face changed and his expression solidified, because he saw Lucien’s eyes laughing, his right hand bounced a silvery coin, and his body was like a current. The long snake is coiled and the magnetic field distorts the sense of space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the colorless solidified thing is unchanged, leisurely going down, very eye-catching in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have his mantra been fake? Deliberately forced me to go away?" A deceived anger rose in the heart of Rudolf II as " The symbol of honesty and kindness, he hates being deceived! However, "Lu Xi'an's electromagnetic gun" is a spell inscribed in the soul, instantly turned into a huge electric dragon bombardment, the speed is fast, so that he just finished flashing inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face became dignified, and the wings behind it slammed forward, holding Rudolph II's whole person under the white feathers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! The place where the electromagnetic gun projectile collided with the wing occurred a terrifying noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pieces of black feathers are beautiful, a striking hole in the wound appears in the center of the wing, and even Rudolph II’s chest is flesh and blood, and the body is slightly trembling. Suffered a brief tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the voltage and magnetic field of this electromagnetic gun are not strong enough, just the level of the six rings, and can not really seriously hurt the "pseudo-golden knight". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucien wanted only a slight pause under the huge impact of the electromagnetic gun, and the left chest lit up with a crystal clear but indifferent cold light, which was outlined as a medal. The appearance, followed by a quiet, cold beam quickly hit, hit the wound on the chest of Rudolf II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this wound as the center, Rudolf II condensed a layer of crystal clear ice at almost no time interval, as if he had made a human form for him. Hail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne also planned to use the spells such as curse to reduce the resistance of Rudolf II, and then it was the silent hail, but when it was really hands-on, it was discovered. Under the baptism of the previous "Life Sacrifice" and "Heavenly Rain", Danielle, who was possessed by Rudolf II, had long been destroyed by armor and his magical resistance was reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien showed his master's hand and caught the "solid", once again abandoned it high, and mourned a long spell in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, when the mantra went to the middle section, the test tube ruptured, and the solidified colorless things inside twisted and squirmed, taking a deep chill, and then turned into A glossy ice crystal ray, along with Lucien's right hand waving, slammed on the silent hail that melted to half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sudden blue and crystal clear light around everything, everything is condensed into ice, Rudolph II is a "destroyed" body like A lifelike ice sculpture, then turned into a drop of rain, gasified into a diffuse smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Natasha holds the "pale justice" in both hands, and has stepped over a distance of nearly ten meters, a heavy weight against the white smoke. hack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white smoke suddenly highlights a illusory face without facial features, which is torn apart under the attack of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projection without attachment is like a grievance, and it is completely annihilated by the "pale justice" that restrains it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pseudo-golden knight, and several magics, including the Nine Rings magic, solve the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, it’s a devil!" Sophia in the distance seemed to feel empathy at the moment when the grievances disappeared, shivering, and "Citrus" on Lucien again. Have a deep understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, she was awake, and she was fortunate that she was only remotely controlling the situation, otherwise I would not have had the last good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wiping the forehead with a cold sweat, she sighed softly: "It’s a quasi-big arcian and a genius musician. He has a better devil than a devil. More talent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that even a man like Natasha would like him, brother, you have no hope."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha puts away his sword and self-examines his physical and mental condition, Rudolph II The projection is so weird that I have to be careful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, his projection has been severely affected by Aitna's sword. It is difficult to continue after the second eradication. The ability of the body." Lucien comforted Natasha while examining his own soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha carefully checked it again and asked Camille to check herself as well, which faded away from seriousness and calmness, and smiled: "I don't think about Etna." Is it placed on your left hand, is the usual activity affected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I look at Natasha’s expression, the more she feels that she laughs very much. Deep and picking up an eyebrow: "What activities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am talking about the gestures of these activities." Natasha deliberately pretended to see through The serious appearance, and then could not help but laugh, which made Lucien feel very cordial, still Natasha who discussed the gentleman's topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after she smiled twice, she converges and looks around: "Now is not a joke, we are going, the devil is not going to be a demon." How long will it be resurrected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tell me the location of the Magic Council, I rushed myself." Lucien saw Natasha's eyebrows pick, The right hand rubbed his chin and quickly explained: "My destiny has a special star, and I have a pinnacle on it. It is basically not locked by Congos's legendary powerhouse. It is easier to avoid him, not only with you, not only It hurts you and hurts me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha gently decapitated, agreeing with Lucien’s reason, without any muddy water and entanglement: “Magic The parliament needs to cross the desert to the east and then fly over a sea. They control and search for a small continent there, and this belongs to the category of the church, but it has not yet had time to find the west. Oh, it looks like something. Can be solved, you are careful on the road, except your teacher Hathaway mother-in-law, don't trust too much other arcane masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will set off immediately, this pale justice..." Lucien When she finished, she was interrupted by Natasha. She smiled and said: "I want to give it to me? Well, I like it very much, but after you get rid of the danger, you may still use it along the way. I will also sneak into the magical parliament to control the side, inform Hathaway's mother-in-law and the storm to rule the Lord in advance, let them look for you, which will reduce your danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
