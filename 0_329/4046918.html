			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey returned to school for a long time from the evening class, so he walked into his bedroom, thinking about quietly thinking about the problem. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you come back?" Sami is holding a fried chicken, sitting in the **, watching the home TV set on the wall, from time to time The above funny show is amused, the rare spirit is shaking, and the ghost behind him is lazy on him, not willing to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny replied casually: "I didn't tell you? I am going to the Arc de Triomphe to get the 'Wake Necklace'."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami scratched his messy hair and didn't care too much: "The sun is too strong at noon, I am in a state of extreme want to sleep, how can I remember what you said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, this delicate boy turned his head and looked at Donnie: "Wait, you say 'clear necklace'? You don't have enough money to buy 'awake Necklace 'have?'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only noticed the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey laughed and laughed at himself: "How could it be enough? Our apprenticeship and trainee Arcane division subsidy is only a little, the primary magic school is not like There are so many scholarships in the college. I met a good bookstore owner this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will probably talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami gently beheaded, there is no doubt about Downey’s experience, except for arcane and magic, he rarely thinks deeply about other things, I don’t know It is because of limited energy or its own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Downey’s words, Sami turned his head and continued to watch TV. At this time, the funny show was over and entered the advertisement. A beautiful girl was showing The simple and beautiful dress on the body - due to the increase of the alchemy workshop, the changes in the living environment and social structure, represented by the alchemy center Lentat, the trend of clothing has changed greatly, towards two trends, One is more succinct, more convenient for regular clothes, and the other is more complicated and more singular banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Downey is not strange to Sami's state, sometimes standing up, sometimes sitting, sometimes lying down and thinking about the choice of the Magic Academy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Downey always made up his mind, so he coughed a little: "Sami, there is something I want to ask you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami turned his head again, and there was a bit of exhaustion between his looks: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Considering the question of choosing a magic school." Downey whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami frowned frowningly: "Did you not think about Holt long ago? Don't study the most wonderful and deepest microcosm?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...do not want to, in the microscopic field, almost half of the formulas and equations are crowned by Evans or Lucien, and they are very complicated, one Seeing them, I can't help but resist and hate..." Downey frankly stated his thoughts, and finally said, "I want to study relatively simple points, there are not so many formulas and equations in the field, I, I don't want to always Make a nightmare called 'Lusien Evans'... What advice do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami licked his head and took a sip of fried chicken. Without any comments on Downey’s idea of ​​escaping, he directly said: “The current microscopic field contains elements, electromagnetics, alchemy, light and darkness, and part of the force field. It is the 'main battlefield' of Lord Evans. It is the system that he established. If you don't want to study it, you can only go to the macroscopic star..."<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talked about the word "star", he turned his eyes and projected it on the bookshelf in the corner of the bedroom. There was a book borrowed from the library that had not been returned, and the materials they had accumulated over the past five years. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity", "Evans Analysis of Destiny's Starry Sky", "The Relationship between Divination and Evans' Essential Model", "Lusien Astrology" ... The name of this book jumped into Sami's eyes, and he snorted: "...the star phase does not work either. It is also the 'territory' of Evans, although the 'situation' is not as serious as the microscopic field. But I heard that the Evans field equation makes many astrologers have a headache and go crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami's eyes lit up and stopped the fried chicken that was sent to his mouth: "Are you not very good at psychoanalysis in the field of illusion? Please report 'The Tower of the Wizards'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Psychological analysis..." Downey's expression was first of all a joy, then it seemed to think of something like looking at the bookshelf. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "The Interpretation of Dreams" by: Lannister? Stanislas, Lucien? Evans ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "behavioral psychology", Author: Lucien? Evans, Elika? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; Lavigne, Isabella ...... <br <br /> & nbsp /> "personality defects, psychological shadows and sixteen kinds of methods corresponding to the real illusion", Author: Lucien? Evans...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Application of Lucien Personality Analysis in Illusion...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie plucked his gaze sharply, patted the bed with his right hand and lowered his head in frustration: "No, although there are not so many formulas and The equation can still be filled with 'Lu Xi' and 'Evans'. Many definitions in this field are completed by Lord Evans..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Almost every field has His rich traces? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is much better than the micro and macro fields, Lucien’s results are only a relatively small part of the basics, but can be evaded by the subconscious For Nepal, it is still shocking and can’t bear to look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost behind Sami began to get active, constantly picking up the surrounding small ornaments to play, and Sami became awkward and powerless: "That There are only dead spirits and transformations. These two factions have almost no achievements of Lord Evans, except for the theory of the essence of the soul without the details, the basic theory of deformation, and the experiment of the origin of life that is more biased towards the elemental system."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter which field of the two major factions of the Necromancer and the Deformation, you need to have a detailed understanding of the body structure of different creatures, so apply to Heidler College, where the anatomy and The magical biostructure is the strongest in the entire parliament. Occasionally, Mr. Felipe and others will give lectures or instructions in person, and we can continue to be classmates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;His spirit has become very poor. When I say this sentence, my gaze is still burning. Because of the spiritual relationship behind him, he was afraid of being a child, and he was hated. The four people’s bedroom was scared only. The rest of Downey’s nerve is not tough or Blunt guy, all he cherished this rare friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death...Transformation...anatomy...biological structure..." Downey repeated these words, his eyes suddenly lit up: "Although we probably I understand the truth of magic and the world, but in fact we don't know much. Even our body structure and genetic factors have not yet been clarified. The study of chromosomes has not broken through the progress of surnames. This is a hope and passion. The field!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami sleeps with a deep sleep: "Take the Heidler Academy, there are dozens of anatomical and genetic pioneers. And authoritative attention and occasional guidance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused: "And, since the discovery of chromosomes by Mr. Felipe more than a decade ago, Ivans After the Arcane Award and the Immortal Throne Award, there is no breakthrough in the field of surnames. Only by relying on the accumulation in the front, you and Mr. and Mr. have received an Evans Magic Prize and a Medical Award respectively, so the heat is decreasing year by year, not so much. People are applying for the exam, and the competition is relatively less intense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donny listened and nodded, becoming more excited and excited, as if he had found himself fighting for a lifetime path of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, paced back and forth, occasionally clenched his fist and flicked a little, his expression sometimes pleasing, sometimes yearning, sometimes twitching, sometimes distort, after a while, he Taking a deep breath, the voice shivered slightly but firmly said: "Sami, I decided to apply to Heidler College to apply for the body structure and genetic factors of the Necromancer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After saying this sentence, he felt that he had no hesitation and hesitation, and the haze disappeared, his eyes turned to Sami, but he found that he was holding fried chicken, leaning obliquely on the bed, his eyes closed. It has fallen into a deep sleep, and the ghost behind him is dancing with his arms, seemingly cheering for Downey’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
