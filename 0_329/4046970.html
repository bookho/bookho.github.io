			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Time Stop" effect is produced, the silver white fades, the darkness disappears, the lightning solidifies in the air, the rain crystallizes in the silence, and the whole world is only a faint gray, in the Alfonso in the spell range is like an insect frozen in ice crystals, maintaining a strange posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, a slamming sound that passed through the "stop" was introduced into Douglas’s ear, and then he saw the ashes one inch. Fragmentation, as if it were broken glass, the world is fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This?" After learning the "time stop" nine-ring spell, Douglas never encountered this situation when he was using it. Break the spell effect! Even if he is good at restraining emotions, keeping calm, and blessing many spells, it is inevitable at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ice crystal" drifting, Alfonso returned to normal, but the lightning is still slow, the rain is like a stop, just a long wave of sparkling waves in the sky Falling down, rushing, never returning, just like time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mighty "Times of the River" awakened everyone in the effect of the stop, broke the ultimate silence, crashed upside down, shrouded dozens of nearby The black forest of Mi, let everything linger, "water waves" rippling, like clear and dim underwater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it’s near Anord, Douglas and Fernando, or from the distance of Nelson, Congos and Amanta, it’s like entering a transparent amber In the midst of it, it is slow and "firm" to "cast" toward the "times of the river" in the center. They have different expressions, or anger or stunned, and they can not control their actions, just as any intelligent life can't compete with the passage of time. same! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ketonia!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plyhill in the Tower of the Destroyer is slightly better One point, I was shocked to see that the beginning of the "Times of the River" was a vague and distorted young man. His half-length black hair fluttered, his hands and long swords were like water, and a pair of deep blue eyes. Looking at the bottom with ridicule, the endless temperament, arrogance, and arrogance is the "heart of time" Ketonia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "Time Heart" Ketonia in the South! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword is the first to stop in the "time of the long river" in front of the "dead servant" silently separated from each other, the rotten meat is turned into a fly Gray, skull, hand bones, ribs scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a sword, so terrible to such a degree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heart of Time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ketonia!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could he appear here?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers, Nelson, Douglas, etc. all cast Yu Guang to Anord, isn’t Paige leading him to the South? Isn't it based on multi-faceted intelligence that he is still in the South? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at Anord, they are still casting spells, trying to get out of trouble, but within the influence of "times and long rivers", their movements are slow and their thinking is slow. Even the magical display is extremely slow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, fear, sorrow, horror, despair and other emotions emerged in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it you?" Plyhill and others seemed to hear Anord sigh for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's me." There was a figure behind Ketonia, wrinkles deep, eagle hook nose, turned out to be the vice president of the Sorcerer Union, Rigg! Sent to lead the Grand Master of Ketonia! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still has a gloomy face, but with a vicious and happy smile, the voice sounds in every soul: "I was just selling a little intelligence." In exchange for the benefits, I did not think about destroying the entire organization, but your old guy actually sent me to do such a dangerous task, you are now blaming you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Haha, thanks to the intelligence of Rieg, I have finally had the opportunity to completely eliminate these organizations!" Alfonso made a cruel and satisfying laugh, and the nearby Cardinals and Paladins quickly approached him to protect Around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is even more angry: "Old guy, dirty traitor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is like water, eroding this valley and forest, all within this range The magician, the spells frequently missed, there is no way to escape, which makes them desperate, angry, and wronged, Congers and other high-level masters are ready to self-destruction, resurrected in the place of preparation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a sword smashed Anord’s necromancer and restricted everyone’s actions, Ketonia raised his sword again, a clear voice. Resounding in everyone's mind: "Unfortunately there are only a few Masters..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint pride is full of words, no Arnold, Douglas, etc. Put it in your eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to only the lich of the bones, the faces of others are slightly gray, as if death is close at hand, the pressure of the second-order epic knight is unusual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia’s voice just fell, and the darkness behind his back highlighted a face. “He’s huge, wearing a black hood, eyes. It is two pale flames, and the mouth is open, giving a rugged syllable that ordinary people can't hear, like the coming death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A black whirlwind emerged directly from the foot of Ketonia, wrapping him and Rigg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whirlwind is like a smoke, dead, even if you just look at it, the dozens of high-ranking priests and night watchmen below quickly rotted the body. It turned into a sly cockroach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bones of the servant who had been smashed and scattered by Ketonia, a root blasted out, emitting white smoke, instantly engulfing the forest and the valley Only the skull flew up and fell into the huge face. In the air, a thin figure with a long black robe was condensed in the air, and a piece of soul was surrounded by "he". Sorrowful sorrow, seems to praise him, praise him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This figure is very similar to the servant of the dead, but the black giant scorpion floated into the sky, as if waiting for the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horrible smog, a cardinal suddenly screamed, and the faint soul was drawn directly from the body, incorporating smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of a pastor, bishop, night watchman, and paladin also flew out, joined the dead spirits of the carnival in the smoke, and a tree withered, Each creature is rotten, except for the magician and a few clerics, there is no country of death for any life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale smog began to condense, and a series of fear, pain, and distorted vague faces floated together to form a cage that trapped the black whirlwind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black whirlwind cracked open a gap, as the wave of water eroded out, at the same time, a cardinal behind Alfonso Suddenly erupted with the paladin, a fire storm, a direct self-destruction, Alfonso, who was caught off guard, was torn apart and the soul was separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" Alfonso, who is still proud, never thought about it. Even if he died, there was only a faint horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia holding a long sword from the black whirlwind, just saw this scene, and Rigg became a water without any moisture The dry corpse, falling directly from the sky, all his life-saving magic will work in the future, only the face is solidified with unbelievable fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invading the mind, weaving memories, the storm of death, the fog of the dead soul..." Ketonia first muttered a few words, then the expression was dignified and slightly Surprisingly looking at the mysterious man outside the fog, the mage who was "surrounded" by a soul face: "Thannos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; While speaking, his figure became blurred, holding a long sword, flickering forward, as if to shuttle through different time and space, in order to avoid the blockade of "the soul of the fog." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is so sudden and so rapid that Plyhill, Nielsen, and others have not reacted, watching the matter happen until you hear Ketonia They said that they suddenly realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
