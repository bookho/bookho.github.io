			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Mr. Evans, you are the only low-level Arcanist I have ever known for the first two arcane thesis. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May's courtesy congratulations to Jean-Sean's ridiculous emotions disappear, yeah, in fact, it is a matter of luck to pass the audit of the Arcane Review Committee. If it is not the paper that is accompanied by an experimental report that re-measures the atomic weight of some of the elements, it may be the worst situation if the person in charge of the review sees his own question about several well-recognized atomic quantities. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the paper has passed the review, then I have to find a way to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires an arcane expert to discover new elements from the mysterious magic minerals based on his own description - he has guessed it in more detail and describes the class The aluminum element can be found by means of spectroscopic analysis. The silicon-like element can be replaced by the alchemical reaction, and even the mineral's possible surname has some assumptions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you want such an arcane master, you must experiment with magic minerals yourself and let more arcanes see the paper. The larger the base, the more likely the Arcans will re-examine the oddly magical ore in the hands of the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only ones who have such influence and are willing to publish the elemental theory articles are "Arcane", "Elements", "Alchemy" and "Holm Magic". "Calette Arcane Theory" and so on, a little bit more "Organic Arcanist Monthly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "Arcane Discussion" and "Magic Research Monthly" are not within the consideration of Lucien, the influence is too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several journals that remove non-contracted manuscripts and do not publish papers other than the magician. The only thing that can be chosen by Lucien is "Arcane". "Elements", "Alchemy" and "Organic Arcanist Monthly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best choice is "Arcane", but hope is unusual, but Lucien is never a person who gives up even if he tries not to try, so Get up and say: "Ms. Lucy, thank you for your congratulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After coming out of the office, Lucien was in the Hall of the Wizards Management Department with Cindy and Donna After chatting a few words, I heard the specific location of the 11th floor of the Arcane Journal Headquarters from their mouths, and then went to the lift of the Magic Tower Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the yellow-green mask, the silver-gray disc slowly rises, and Lucien is calm and hopefully looking at the hall. The magicians and apprentices are getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lift crossed the ninth floor, Lucien pressed his right hand in the yellow-green light, which bloomed into a silver-gray disc. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sucking the fine awns, the silver-gray disc is slightly shaken when it is connected to the central hole of the fourth layer, stopping, and the yellow-green mask slowly cracks. Opened a door-like mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the lift, Lucien easily found the hall with the silver "Arcane" words according to Cindy's description. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are light floor tiles in the hall, which is bright, quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of a man and a woman in charge of reception, Lucien asked politely: "Hello, I want to know if I contribute to the "Arcane" journal, Which gentleman do you need to find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who had been talking with the beautiful lady had a look at the arcane and magic badges on the chest of the chest, smiled Disappeared, seriously asked: "I would like to ask this gentleman, is your arcane thesis, or your teacher or friend's arcane thesis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pair of men and women Wearing an arcane badge with two silver stars on the black background, and a nameplate with the words of the arcane and their names, there is no magic badge. It seems that all of them are based on arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gavin, my own paper wants to vote for the "Arcane" journal." Lucien looked at the man's nameplate, he has A name that is more popular than oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin’s expression is more serious, and the official business is authentic: “Sorry, this gentleman, the “Arcane” journal does not accept the submission of low-level Arcans.”< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin is a little angry. Does the magician really don’t know, or do you know? This is an unwritten but true rule. Can your paper compete with those high-level arcans or even arcans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are indeed papers in the middle and low-level arcanes that have been published in our journals, but all of them were assessed as significant after the review, we Directly drafted. There has never been an example of a low-level Arcanist who submitted a manuscript to us. "The same lady named Heidi is worried that Lucien is the kind of hard-working, true-natured magician, so he explained it slightly politely. One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fears were quickly "confirmed", and Lucien was not arrogant: "There was no precedent, not that it is not now, not in the future. As long as it does not violate It is stipulated why I don't accept my contribution. If I am returned by the auditor of the Arcane Master after submitting the manuscript, it is the level of my own paper is not enough, it is rejected according to the regulations, I have no opinion."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Magician, you will give me the Arcane thesis, I will send it to the Auditor's Office. Today is the fourth day of the month, except for the last month. In addition to the published papers, there are not many new papers. I think the results of the review will come out soon.” Jia Wen’s speed is quick, and the annoyance is obvious. It seems that I want to send away this magician who can’t communicate like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien handed the paper in his hand to him: "Tell me, Mr. Gavin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin took Lucian's thesis, entered a corridor in the back, and waited until there was no one, and then read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea in his mind is that if you are not sure about the value of the paper, then it’s really sent to the auditor’s office for assessment, and if If you can confirm it, you don't have to bother with a few high-ranking arcans, so as not to be embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the reading, Gavin is still very serious, because the cycle name law described is so obvious, those surnames are similar to horror, can be seen Looking at it, he sneered: "How can the atomic weight of the 'Temirik' element be wrong? In the past few years, several high-level Arcans have re-measured the value corrected by several different methods. Such a paper can also be reviewed by the audit committee. It must be that the two gentlemen gave it to the newly recruited students for review!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temirik elements are A strange element that constitutes the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more reading, Gavin came back directly and returned the paper to Lucien: "This gentleman, the auditor is scolding me." Because you have a lot of mistakes in this paper, there is no value at all. He even wonders how you passed the committee review!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien licked his teeth, I couldn't find the signs and continued to insist. I had to take the paper back to the first floor, and then I entrusted a messenger in the magician management department to send the manuscript of the paper to the Rendat "Elements" journal headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ As Jiawen said, the review of the journals at the beginning of the month was not busy, and the third day after the posting, the return of the "Elements" journal The letter was sent to the Garden Villa in Lucien, Douglas School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only on Saturday afternoon, Lucien saw the letter coming, and after arranging a few questions, he ignored the distorted expressions of Lei Yiya and Heidi. Take the envelope apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Mr. Lucian Evans:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your paper has some discussion Value, but at the beginning of next month, there will be an elemental will, the Holm Royal Devils Court’s 'Elemental and Alchemy Magic Annual Conference', we have confirmed all the papers published at the conference, so I am sorry Post your paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All elements and friends of Alchemist Masters Elemental Journal January 6th, 817"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xi’an silently looked at the letter: “It seems that this is the legendary rejection letter. It’s really euphemistic. If you really want to publish it, you can make a paper in the next issue. However, such a refusal is indeed very polite and not very hurtful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the New Year, he suffered setbacks one after another, Lucien seriously examined himself The main star of fate, found that it is still vague, neither good nor bad: "The journey has not changed, is it to ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp After A Line for various reasons they can not give Natasha and John wrote, so a negative character became "<br <br /> & nbsp />;</div>
