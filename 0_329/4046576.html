			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien seems to have countless crows flying in front of him, and seems to have seen his bankruptcy, although in the past few years he has been from the minerals and harvest company, the element gift company When the technology investment gained a lot of profits, but it was all invested in the construction of the magic tower three months ago, it almost didn't make enough. In the past few months, it was easy to reward from the new alchemy's arcane point, the supplementary reward of the light quantum hypothesis, and the annuity. Revenue has returned to the ranks of "rich people", and compared with this improved nine-ring ritual-type spell, I am afraid there is still a big gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full tilt of the parliament in materials, potions, magic, etc. is hard to come by. It’s hard to pay for the price of the pale hand. In the last half-god lich, chasing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien seriously considered the mortgage from the teacher or the Holm Mining Union Bank, when the monocle became slightly hot . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, I just ended the meeting of the Noble House, sentenced the lesson of the Earl of ElBaradei, and deprived him of his title..." Natasha Some excitement said that she had no sympathy and compassion for the behind-the-scenes planner who caused Lucian and herself so much damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienqiang resisted the pain of bankruptcy and smiled: "After any aristocrat who has assassinated your thoughts, you will think about it before you take action." The end of the Earl of ElBaradei."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha said what happened in the House and the conversation with Ketonia in a chattering tone, the last "The land of Earl of ElBaradei, I divided it into five, one for the abrupt loss of Camille, three to appease and draw the Duke of James, and the rest was originally intended for you, but now The situation can't put you on the bright side, so I have accepted the royal family, but in private it will be converted into a specific amount to Jintal, alchemy workshop shares, materials, articles, etc. This is what you deserve. No refusal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked, opened his mouth, smiled on his face, blurted out: "Natasha, I love you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a windfall from the sky, paying for the improved version Life hiding technique "more than sufficient, but there is still wealthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Natasha did not think that she would get such an answer, and she was very upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not attempt to conceal her, and said the improved version of life hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way I feel more relieved, I don't think you are a 'Financial fan', but fortunately I am the Queen and the future female grandfather, hehe." Natasha laughs. Tao, learning what Road Sean said in the morning, "Unfortunately, before the promotion of the legend, the knight must maintain the unity of the body, blood, soul and will. This method cannot be used as the last life-saving measure. Oh, the road of the knight is destined. It is a difficult and difficult road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Violet family has an epic knight, the Hoffenberg family has two, and the experience of the Cavaliers in promotion Above, Natasha is much stronger than the average knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has some understanding of this, if not, "physical control" Ramiro's proliferation and regeneration ability in a relatively large range is not his exclusive The card is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending the call, Lucien found that teacher Fernando looked at himself with a funny smile: "What is it, teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "It’s so young, it’s good to have a queen to be a lover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly moved the topic : "Teacher, does the modified life occultation have to be part of the body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the unique ritual of the "Pale Hand", Lucien I don't know the specific situation, I only know the details of the original version of life hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a look at Lucien: "If I understand this in detail, I can develop it myself. Anyway, the original life occlusion can only be used by the limbs. Part of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a few days, you will stay at Aringe with peace of mind, and wait for the life burial ceremony to be completed, wherever you go. Start next month. The discussion of Oliver's transformation should be increased. We should also pay attention to guiding their discovery of the relativistic effect. After two or three months, we can initially give your narrow relativity to Douglas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Office of the Atomic Research Institute, Lucien is looking at the papers that several of his students have reviewed, and fine-tuning the final comments from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock took the magazine and dozens of resumes and walked in with exhaustion: "Lu Xien, the second round of interviews is over, three After the final interview, let's see what's wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned over his resume, about forty copies, and laughed: "Yes, there are five or six mid-level magicians. You have to go through it first, and then look for the committee to check their bottom. In the total interview, I will also use illusion to try to prevent the church and the organization's spies from coming in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s both publicly advertised and the current hot atomic research institute. If the spies don’t want to get in, they’ll be responsible for them. Not a little careless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock agrees with the authenticity: "The penetration of the church is very powerful. After all, there are many frustrations in the parliament and the mage who is about to reach the end of life."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, he seems to think of something, handing the magazine in his hand to Lucien, suppressing the voice, quietly saying: "Do you know? Lord Oliver and Ms. Florenza dismissed the marriage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien picked up the magazine and saw that it was the lace journal of "Alinhe Impression", which was turned over at random. I found a description of the matter and shook my head. "In this way, all seven major arcans in the parliament are single. This is really a dumbfounding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After chatting about the so-called "gossip" by Lucien, Roker stood up with satisfaction and walked outside the door. Just opened the door and saw a refined middle-aged man wearing a wig. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Lord Oliver..." Roque’s face was white, and he said a lot of bad things in his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver nodded and passed by Rock, closing the office door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this is the script I wrote, how do you look at it." Oliver glanced at "Alin's Impression", quietly Said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the script from the "toothache" and read it roughly. He looked at the corner of his mouth and twitched. He almost suspected that Oliver was crossing the earth. The fellow countryman, this is like the "Mermaid Princess" of Andersen. Fortunately, the latter half has a different nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver wrote a handsome prince, met a mermaid princess at sea, both sides produced love, and then the mermaid princess gave up the other, swallowed the devil The medicine, faded the tail, turned into an elf-like girl and returned to his country with the prince, and agreed to each other for a lifetime, but then the prince fell in love with the princess of another country, so the mermaid girl was heartbroken and returned to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the prince gradually recognized his heart and understood that he loved the mermaid girl, so he sat on the sailboat every day and went out in the wind and waves. The name of the mermaid princess, but unfortunately no response, one day passed, the prince finally died. Before his death, his hallucination made him see the mermaid princess toward himself, so his face smiled with a sweet smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very tragedy..." Lucien didn't know what to evaluate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver sighed: "The tragedy can impress a woman to save a marriage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean once again felt "toothache" and couldn't help but said: "Lord Oliver, I really don't understand why you love Miss Florenza, but betray the marriage again and again, and bring harm to her."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver seriously said: "Lu Xien, you don't understand, I am serious about every love, I have invested my most passionate and unrestrained feelings, love is like The fire is as blazing, and all my heart is dedicated to the other side. In such love, my inspiration will burst, my thoughts will sublimate, and many of my achievements are studied under such circumstances."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love each of them, but I love Florensa."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien I don’t know what expression I should make, although the Chinese on the earth often “persuade and not persuade”, but I heard Oliver’s self-analysis. I'll just applauded for every leave his lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien thought in a tone: "Lord Oliver, I am really embarrassed, Lord Hathaway, Lord Morris, I don't want me to write opera for you, and they..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not finish, a "you know" expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver sighed and sighed a long sigh: "I understand that this is too much trouble, they are the Hoffenberg family. Elder. Lucien, I hope to cooperate with you in other operas in the future. The best scripts naturally have the best musicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send Oliver, the road Sean closed the door and didn't want to go to their family. Anyway, Hathaway had a bad impression on Oliver for a long time. Oliver went to ask her, she would only default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning this off, Lucien can only learn the creation of the opera himself, but fortunately there are many classics in his mind as a reference, he has initially selected Mr. Wagner’s second "Women of the Nibelungen" is the blueprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this opera, based on German and Nordic folklore, is in line with the world and Natasha, and Lucien must make a natural surname. Changes are considered new creations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of Oliver’s visit, Lucien got Fernando’s call, knowing that the ceremony can be carried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, an empty hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the long-lost Felipe, he was still pale and looks like a sick face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This magic is based on his cell memory surname research and improvement, with his cooperation, my success rate will be improved a lot." Fernando frankly this is the first Once you use the improved life hiding technique, the soul of the dead will not come to host Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe looked at Lucien, it’s hard to believe that his teacher would not kill him twice, and eventually he fell, but in the presence Fernando's face, he will not say these things, but gently sighs: "Your magnifying magic based on the principle of light is good, but it seems to be far from the effect you promised."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His magic level has been raised to the Seventh Ring, which is a very fast progress, compared to Lucien, it seems a bit shabby, the Arcane level is close to seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very serious: "Improvement is always a step by step, rest assured, I will not give up this research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic Diffraction Experiments Wayne has never dared to do it, ready to wait for the narrow relativity and the harvest brought by Silver Moon to digest almost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Lucien asked his own concern: "Felipe, can the modified version of the life-shelter use only limbs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe said coldly: "The hair and teeth are not included in the blood. It is ineffective. You should not think about it and it will protect you from safety. You are Greedy and irrational people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a chance, he never minds ridiculing Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien frowned: "What about the internal organs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe One voice: "Yes, but what's the point? Even if it is a Knight, a part of the internal organs is only able to recover. It does not mean that there is no internal organs and no elementalization. They can persist for a long time, and life is hidden. The cut parts can't be re-extended, and you can't think of something unrealistic by using a variant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the internal organs Can you?” Lucien’s expression relaxed. “I asked for the 'intestines’ of the designated area.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe slightly looked at Lucien, It seems that I have never seen such a stupid person: "Are you sure? The ceremony failed, I will not compensate for the lost wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am sure." Lucien If you have two such rituals, you can give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
