			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bragging, that is the "mouth gun"... Lucien feels that there seems to be a crow in front of him laughing and flying, his inner impotence It is arguing that the priests and believers of other gods such as Nina and Nob, who are unaware of the truth and are shackled, are normal and reasonable. How can they even believe in themselves and Francis on him? That pile of descriptions that broke through the sky? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A normal person should not be stunned afterwards, and then laugh at the liar? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is a false god, not a normal person. According to the description of the Magic Council, they are mentally mad and belong to the category of "electric shock treatment". It is understandable, but how can there be such a big change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not even improve your strength? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly wants to shout "This is not the Arcane", but fortunately he is prepared for all kinds of abnormalities in the realm of the gods, this is the surprise pressure Next, start to observe El, analyze the reasons, the magic notebook in the soul library spread out, recording all the small places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While doing this, Lucien looked at Francis sideways and found that he also looked at him with a helpless smile. Obviously, he and Lu Xien had The same surprise, however, in the blink of an eye, Francis's eyes settled down and focused on El, seemingly revealing a hint of fanaticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is really good at theology, philosophy, the change of 'spirit' can really arouse his interest, confirming some of his views." Lucien vaguely I guessed a bit of Francis's mentality, which may be why he wants to wrap El with the theory of the god of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, it’s getting more and more that Lucien can’t guess the origins of Francis. After all, the characters who are really good at theology and powerful are probably from the church. What Francis has done so far is no doubt the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting his eyes, Lucien asked in surprise: "The great 'resurrection, abundance and the god of death', I don't understand your god too much." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El calmly and deeply smiled: "In short, I found the true self, the "existence" that transcends everything and cannot be described in the spirit and The projection of the material world, whether it is the god of fire and destruction, or the god of resurrection, abundance, and redemption, is only a change that people recognize and combine with this projection. They have the same essence, and this essence is 'I'. Until me Enlightened this, I really managed the two changes of Afando and El, and made them truly two-in-one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great El God, are you okay?" Francis smacked his mouth and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it going? I feel good, better than ever." El smiled confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medicine can't stop... Lu Xien silently groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See "Leviathan" and Francis are still concerned about the appearance, Elne heart sighs a sigh, mortals even if they have talent, and then have a spiritual surname, Still can't really understand the greatness of the gods, so he shows his powerful and never-before-good "good" to the two devout and outstanding disciples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment around him has become dark, faintly able to sense a strong sense of death, and in the darkness of death, there are ghosts, demons and other undead creatures emerging." The rotten material created a fertile "soil" glow, and several grasses in the room grew wildly, and at the same time, a quiet and serene feeling made people feel peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Resurrection', abundance, redemption... El is no longer a god disguised as a god of fire, but truly has these three priesthoods 'Resurrection, abundance and the god of redemption', the strength has reached the ontology, that is, the level of the Knights of the Eight Knights, but the state of weakness is still the same, really hands up, it is estimated that only the strength of the seven levels can be played."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the change of priesthood due to his own 'enlightenment'? Or is it because believers began to piously believe in his "resurrection, fertility, and redemption god"?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recorded everything he observed on the magic notes in the soul library, and approved the red standard: "If it is the former, then the world is more than I imagined." Crazy, this phenomenon is similar to the existence of the cognitive world, but it is obviously more absurd. It shows that the road of arcane exploration is still far-reaching. If it is the latter, it can construct a relatively mature system with the current theory, but it also lacks the key. Part of the power, lack of argument, lack The actual evidence, equally revealing deep long road ahead, need to be careful to explore, a little arrogant will explode his head "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"The future, but you can make the assumption that human beings have the spiritual power, but the strengths and weaknesses are different. The spiritual talent is beyond the standard. You can control it by meditation for your own use. The magician, and the spiritual talent is below the standard and there is no medicine to stimulate, then the mental power is in a weak and divergent state, in the step of uniformity through religion, the same vision, similar description, after the prayer, the spirit The forces are adjusted to the same special frequencies and come together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if this god has a physical form, then these spiritual powers, or beliefs The things of force will converge on Him. In addition, because of the different expectations of the gods, there will be a division of the priesthood. Different priesthoods can call different kinds of special mental powers to perform spell-like abilities in this field. Strengthen yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a question that explains why the church needs faith, but if the god of truth exists, it is powerful. To this extent, why not directly destroy the magical parliament, why is it indulging the division of the church? Why is there a 'thing' in the cognitive world? Why do the dwarves have a foundation of faith, but no god of steam appears? Why is the god of truth not? Specific priesthood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And according to the general speculation of the parliament, mental power is a very special frequency of electromagnetic waves, that is, light, then why can the soul send out spiritual power? The rough explanation for the Necromancer and the Electromagnetic System is that a special electromagnetic field combines some of the elements..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where written here, Lucien suddenly raised strange thoughts, If you start from the latter, is there such a situation one day:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to FM XXXHoz, here is the god of truth..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of writing in the Lucien Soul Library. In fact, only a few seconds passed. El's body changed, the flames around him, the horrible destruction feeling. Let the grass die directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame and destruction...still the pressure of the eight-day knight, still weak..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Magic notebook, another line of text appears:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that although the strength of El has not increased, it has driven the relationship between the ontology and the avatar. Into the Afan multi-integrated..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of spiritual change, Lucien believes that it is brought by El "enlightenment" Harvest: "Is this the heart of the heart because of the surname?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Lucien’s heart has emerged from the Arcane Masters. It is unclear to study the desire to capture the false gods back to the slice study. However, it is a very effective way to observe and participate in the changes of the pseudo-god, to stimulate and record the reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild animals should be released into nature in order to observe their most essential habits. If not, the false gods should return to the war of God and the change of the priesthood. To their true state change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien heard Francis gently sigh and praised with a smile: "Congratulations to the Lord for mastering the mystery of the two. The true self, become the only and omnipotent true God!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The only true Almighty God?” El asked in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the projection of the great existence, other gods are naturally false gods in front of you, only you can be called the only god, and your power is broad Incomparable, covering all areas, is undoubtedly the Almighty God, other gods are only lost for you, stealing your authority, and when you take them back, you can re-enter the supreme throne." Francis enthusiastically Praise the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only and all-around? Is this not the god of truth? What exactly does Francis want to do? Lucian looked at Francis inexplicably, but it was essentially different from El's incomprehension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;El slightly frowns: "Isn't that going to kill all the gods and deprive the gods? Then there are no allies?" He is still a bit sensible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, how can the only and omnipotent true God control everything in person? He will assign authority to his subordinates, but these subordinates are only half-deity creatures, It is not a god, nor does it have a priesthood. You can control the corresponding field by relying on the gift of the true God. The gods that are attached to you later will degenerate to the extent of this demigod creature, and do not need to be completely killed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
