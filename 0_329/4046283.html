			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power and soul from its own blood transformation is a blend of water and milk, which nourishes its rapid growth, but the skin of Lucian begins to be gray and dry. Like a dry corpse buried deep in the tomb for many years, it is like a withered poplar tree in the Gobi Desert. It is the kind that is not far from death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s legs are soft, muscles are slack, heartbeat slows, and brain thoughts and soul movements seem to be separated, a slow, slow, unclear A condescending, clear and thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This diametrically opposite feeling is so inexplicable and so strange, just like the meditation environment has come to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien’s soul power grows to a certain extent and blood power is quickly hollowed out, when Lucien thinks his body will rot directly, a little bit The strange force infiltrates the teeth from the Rinza into the neck, and the enhancement of the soul and the invisible transformation immediately stop. And the residual little blood force, under the stimulation of this strange power, began to recover, they quickly split, quickly breeding, re-flowing in the blood vessels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to Lucien's skin gradually faded, restoring tightness, regaining its luster, and the muscles have explosive power. Although the heartbeat is still slow but very powerful, the brain is clear and fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of slight paralysis came again, and the fangs of Rhine left Lucien’s neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His body seems to be a lot more transparent, the silver eyes are a little tired, but the smile is still elegant and generous: "A noble gentleman never pays." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shackles of Lucien’s body disappeared and his ability to move back. After carefully checking the situation, I was a little surprised: "The soul has a four-ring magician's degree, and the physical condition has reached the level of the second-level knight... Mr. Rhein, are you all right?" See the Rhine body shaking, huge black The batwing began to shrink, and Lucien asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there are many magic rituals that can help people directly improve their soul and spirit. The ancient sorcerers liked this the most. But this way has two One problem is that the materials and items that are needed are expensive, not risky, or prepared for many years, not many magicians can afford it, and if you convert the money spent into magic potions, you will find these magic potions only Requiring half or one-third is enough for you to meet the promotion requirements, so it is the kind of wizard who needs to be similar to the magic ritual and who needs to improve his strength in a short time for various reasons.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein seems to understand Lucian’s surprises and worries, explaining in detail: “The second problem is that the aftereffects are not small, some are the stones that transform into soul nutrients, the blood of magical creatures, etc. It has a bad influence on the soul, while others have an understanding of magic that is difficult to match their own magic level. These need to be slowly compensated and cleared. If they can't make up or clear, the most serious The situation is that every promotion in the future depends on similar magic rituals, and even the distortion of the family name appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Lucien, you don't have this Two problems, because this is a small reward that I gave you in advance, it consumes the source of my blood, and the nutrients that strengthen your soul are your own blood power, there will be no other negative effects, and your blood power It belongs to the moonlight and has many homogeneity with the vampire, so it can be enhanced by the origin of my blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the knight’s road goes further and further Depend on the will to control, unless you are willing to let go of the study of the Arcane, concentrate on the road of the Cavaliers, otherwise you can not become a great knight. Of course, you can also learn some magicians, directly transform their body with magic and biological materials, thus gaining Quirky but disgusting but powerful flesh and prolonged life, this is one of the purposes of their research with the common blood of different people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For arcane, Magical understanding The law may match the problem of your own magic level, others may be more troublesome, but I think Lucien, the winner of the Holm crown award, should be able to solve it easily." Rhein slyly looked at the "element" of Lucien's right hand. Ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded slightly, eliminating the fear hidden inside, waiting for a week or two to fully control the spiritual power brought by the strong soul, You can try to break through to the fourth ring, two years earlier than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Rhein, when I become a high-level magician, I will start the layout you left behind. But I don't seem to know which places? "Lean, who relaxed, asked jokingly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being said by the Rhine, Lucien quickly instigated with his mental strength, and found that his place on the neck was left with a faint bloody crescent mark, which seemed to be an insignificant birthmark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien snorted: "It seems that Mr. Rhein really does not want me to know other secrets too early."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Lucien you really want to know, you can go to the Arcane Library of the Magic Council to redeem the history of the church, although they are the most common parts, but if you look at it You can find some interesting things. The most common records may contain the most horrifying secrets." Rhein smiled lightly, then pressed his right hand on the chest and gracefully left the ceremony. "The power of projection has been dead. The world is repelling, and I consume the source of the blood, so I can’t maintain it now. Please allow me to leave in advance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s body collapses when the voice falls Solution, turned into a black bat, flying around like a virtual shadow, melting in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver fades, the red fades, the sound disappears, the breeze subsides, everything returns to the state before the dead spirit world, forever black and white gray, always quiet and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This scene is really like the picture of a dove in the square, but the white dove becomes a black bat." Lucien laughed and said to himself. But there is no sound from the exit, and there is silence forever in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around the hall, Lucien looked at the body of Ivanovsky, a very difficult opponent, "interfering" with the blood. It is one of the orthodox of the Master Hunter. If it is not that he is equal to his own level, and there is no strong magical item, the battle environment is narrow, I am afraid that it is self-defeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he did not expect to relax after he entered the spirit world, he did not expect that he could also sense the gap in the entrance to the dead spirit, and he could enter and want to kill. His paladin, which is not weak and agile, is not a simple matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanovsky’s full body armor has been completely damaged under “Gasdon’s poisonous fog” and “Elemental Order”, so Lucien I just picked a few pieces of relatively good metal pieces into the storage bag - maybe later as a material for other alchemy items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of the interference with the blood, Ivanovsky does not have extraordinary items such as rings, necklaces, talisman, belts, etc., only a giant sword and a pair Silver-gray gloves:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Purifier, three-level high-handed giant sword, extra high level before the user's magic resistance level, each hit the other party Can produce sacred power damage equal to physical attacks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a great sword that was specially created to purify the magician."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ogre Gloves, a five-level medium magic item, can boost the power of the user to the great leader of the Ogre, which is the average level of the five-level knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Power is the only reliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two items are contaminated by fog There is a certain degree of corrosion, but they are not attacked by elemental order and big fireballs. The damage is not serious. At least Lu Xien is not refined. Articles repair magician have repaired their grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The purifier is of little use to me, and I have magical resistance to it. Well, I can give it to Leo. The ogres are good." Lucien judged their value by taking these two extraordinary items into their own storage bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien searched Ivanovsky for his entire body, trying to find secret documents and understanding the strength behind him, but unfortunately he was very careful, except one with two There are nothing in the bag of more than ten Shahran gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handling the corpses and traces, Lucien quietly looked at the gray hall, slightly stunned and thought: "Ivanowski behind the scenes What is the great man? What is his relationship with the world of the dead? Is there any other wisdom in the world of the dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mystery of the gods, the true meaning of immortality What are these? In addition to the soul, the deformation, etc., in a world that is so consistent with geophysical and chemical laws, what is its immortal form?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
