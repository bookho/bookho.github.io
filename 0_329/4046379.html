			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating fascinating mask disappeared, and the lines of silver-gray magical lines on the floor were all blackened, as if they were painted with charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central Lucian only feels that his soul is more closely connected with the cognitive world and becomes more powerful than ever. It seems that this will continue to develop and one day he will be able to The soul and cognitive environment are projected into the material world, and the illusion of oneself will be turned into reality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the feeling of a high-ranking magician?" Lucien lifted his hands with delight and looked at them, still slender and powerful, without any change. The changes in soul, spiritual power and cognitive world are very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Lucien also knows that the illusion of being illusory to reality, all the feeling of mastery is only the expansion of consciousness after the promotion, really want to reach this level. At least, it must become a legendary magician. For example, when the teacher knows the world shaking, it can change the sky in the whole Aringe and nearby areas, and the lightning and thunder will be like the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what is the fateless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a deep doubt The voice will wake up Lucien, the fate of no trace? what is that? What is the relationship with the change of the star of my own destiny? Was there any strange phenomenon in the magical array at that time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions are instantly on the way to Sean’s mind. If someone doesn’t ask, he will definitely choose to hide and then go to the High Arcane and Magic Library to find relevant information. , look at half of the fate of the main star into a black hole in the end what is the situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is the soup spectrum. He felt the horror of the magical ritual that seemed to be able to swallow everything. He heard the words that the teacher blurted out, and it produced a strong Curious and deep doubts, even the members of his own affairs committee, the eight-ring magician have not heard of the so-called destiny, what happened to Lu Xien? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not answer his question, touched the head of Affris who was stupid and unclear, and looked at Lucien: "Promotion High-level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, finally stopped the expansion of the starry sky of destiny." Lucien answered truthfully, then asked the same "confused", " Teacher, what is the destiny of the destiny? When I tried to control the destiny of the starry sky, the star of destiny seemed to have a strange change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you stink Every time the kid doesn't make a point, he won't feel relieved." Fernando slammed his face and said, "Peace calmly wait for three or four years and then raise the ranks and do nothing. You must take the risk to advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he paused: "I have been inconvenient to ask about your understanding of the world. This is your own secret, but since you want to know, I Just say a few words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fateless tracker refers to a special type of magician who is connected When the main star forms a reflection, due to various reasons of itself and the outside world, the reflection will collapse into nothingness, and the main star will lose its light, so its trajectory can no longer be observed, and it is impossible to be predicted by astrology and other similar magic. Like they jumped out of the fate of the river, not bound by fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup spectrum surprised: "There is such a magician? This is simply the son of fate!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, he turned his eyes to Lucian, as if he saw an incomprehensible existence, Lucien was a destiny? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you master the astrology magician, you are full of fear of the illusory fate, the fate that is difficult to predict accurately and cannot be reversed. It is impossible to imagine that there will be a magician. Not affected by fate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the son of fate! Hey, it’s not the same death!" Fernando used the surname to satirize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Degraded, teacher, what are the fateless people?" Lucien asked curiously, is this a fateless person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando sneered two times: "I know only five, the most famous one is the Sun Hill Tower, the Archon of the ancient Hillanas Magic Empire. North, the other four are legendary magicians, but they are all fallen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien is also confused, is the Sun King like himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando shook his head and smiled: "This secret is only available to the highest scrutiny team. Well, those ancient magicians who existed when the Sun King had not fallen." More or less can guess. When Tonos was promoted to the legend, he used a large number of sun stones with a kind of ancient corpse called Chilchila to make a small sun. At that time, every legendary magician thought He can't go any further in this way, and he can't think of him as the peak of all the magicians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely, there is no trace of fate, Always creating miracles, and every one has become a legendary magician. Is it really the son of fate?" Tang said while looking at Lucien, "Fernando looked at the soup seriously: "Where do you think? So horrible, the fate of the trail is the most predictive magic of the immune star, the other is similar to the normal magician. As for every fateful person recorded in the literature is a legendary magician, you should think in reverse that the fateless person who has not become a legendary magician is not even qualified to be explored, perhaps in the Archmage, High-level wizards, mid-level magicians, and even the magic apprentices that connect the fateful star are dead. I believe that there are many such fateless people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The imitation magic of immunization is also terrifying. "Lu Xien suddenly expects that he is a fateless person.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I don't believe that there is no real destiny." Fernando took a ridiculous smile. "Accurately, it should be that astrology and other stellar systems predict that magic can't observe the trajectory of their fate, but they just jumped out of the destiny." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is caused by the backwardness of the magical observations of the astrology system and the lack of understanding of such strange fate stars. I believe that with the breakthrough of arcane, the real The positioning of the stars, the development of the magic of the astral system, can certainly determine the trajectory of such a 'nothing' fate by other means. Even if it can't be directly determined, it can be speculated by observing the changes in the sky around it. There is no trace, and there is no real trace! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando said that the tone is quite passionate and the voice is full of confidence. This is what every magician who has experienced the era of arcane development has." Self-confidence, especially the founder of Fernando's big age.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, is Lucien a fateless person? "The soup can't help but ask, Averys is also curious to listen, it is not a stupid dragon who knows little about magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando Lu Xi'an glanced and shook his head, some confused: "I originally thought that Lucien was a fateless person. It was strange why he changed when he was promoted to the ranks, but now it seems a bit different, his fate. The main star can also observe that you have just realized what happened in the world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I started to try to control the outbreak of the star of destiny and the expansion of the starry sky. When it is a little unsupportable, the star of destiny does not know why it suddenly splits itself, and part of it is intense." After the explosion, it collapsed, forming a vaginal vortex that seemed to be able to swallow all the other, and stopped the explosion of another part of the fate of the star. I also took the opportunity to control the expansion of the starry sky. "Lu Xien said that his conscious division has become an unexplained change. Anyway, the reason for the disappearance of fate is not clear. The Magic Council is not clear. I am afraid that the personal experience of the Sun King Tanos is not known.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando puzzled his right hand and knocked his left hand back: "The fate of the main star will split?" What caused it? What is the composition of your cognitive world? If you don't want to say it, don't say it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing can't be said." Lucien smiled and described his own cognitive world. He only concealed the blurring of the feng shui boundary and the part of the ice and snow world. Everyone in the field is aware that he has put forward the assumption of energy discontinuity and believes that electrons are inside the atom. Part of the structure - what the teacher did not know at the outset was the effect of the energy discontinuity hypothesis on the initial substantiveization of his own cognitive world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando probably guessed Lucy I know that there is a part of the world of ice and snow in the world, but I didn’t say it. It’s very difficult to move the right hand with five fingers: “I don’t see any relationship with the split of the fate of the main star. Lucien’s birth period is ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birth season and other factors can interfere with the choice of the destiny star.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En answered one by one according to the identity after the crossing, Fernando naturally failed to find the problem, he simply took out a crystal clear crystal ball, ready to use the astrology to try the current situation of Lucien.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
