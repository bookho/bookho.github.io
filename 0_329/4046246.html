			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 13th floor of the 13th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa wears a light blue dress that is closer to Tria and Aalto style, and smashes itself into a hot body and mature charm. Fully revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat across the desk, her left hand rested, the golden long hair was softly dissipated, quietly listening to Lucien telling about things, wait until Lucien said At the end, the feather pen she held in her right hand swayed and swayed, and then the green and bright eyes looked at Lucien, revealing a light smile: "Evans, do you think this proposal can be passed in the committee? This makes most of the high The Arcanist increased the cost and lowered the income proposal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa did not agree, nor refused, but asked Lucien a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes her stranger to her. Lucian, who doesn’t understand her style of action, doesn’t know what her attitude is. She can only organize the language to answer: “I think There is a certain possibility to pass. Because the cost can be distributed to the final product, and the gentlemen of the Panel should have a lot of people who know astrology, they can divinate, if they continue to do so, how will they change? They also need to The descendants of their blood are considered. In the end, this is a good opportunity for the Druids and the elves to relate to the development of our entire Magic Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Not bad." Florentha licked his long hair and said in a joke. Then her expression was serious: "But the cost is too high, it will affect sales, sales will affect the wealth of the magician's pocket, and wealth is related to their enjoyment of life, purchase materials, magic experiments and magic rituals. I am afraid that no magician will harm his own interests and pay for things that may or may not happen in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the prophecy of astrology shows a very A bad future, but with a lot of magic to stop and have different space to go, I think most magicians will choose to deal with bad results when they start to feed back to themselves, instead of getting a big deal at the beginning. Money prevention. Not everyone has a long-term vision. Most people can only see a few meters in front of them, especially when it comes to their interests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Evans, you have the keen thinking and outstanding talent that most of the arcane masters envy, but you are too naive in the grasp of the human heart. If you rely on the Commission to force the magician through the regulations Obey, the damage will be the authority of the Magic Council and the position of each of the Commissioners in the eyes of the magician who supports them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa sorted out Look at the documents in front of you and say seriously, "You have a good idea of ​​simplifying the "element vortex" to deal with pollution, and have a good reference value, but have you considered its cost?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The constant magic on your 'element' ring costs the wealth that makes Morris's heartache, and can only be applied several times a day. Even in the alchemy workshop, there is energy from the hydropower magic tower. Satisfy the need, even if it is simplified to the extent of the four-ring, three-ring, even if it can provide pure element feedback to the 'element decomposition', it can not fully compensate for its cost, must be spread to the final product, it will return to us The question just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no way to refute, that is, use the "order of elements" to arrange because its ability and efficiency to decompose alchemy materials are far lower In "element decomposition" and "yuan Whirlpool, "so there must enhance the power of magic and assist more energy to meet the needs of separated pollutants which many elements and the value is not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien looked at Florence in earnest: "Mr. Florenza, the cost of the final promotion is not too much." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but for many wealthy people, even if they waste far more than this amount, they will not want to see because of the cost increase. Loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Florensa smiled and said his decision, "Because of the cooperation with the elves and the druids, I will be in business." The committee proposed this motion, but the results are not under my control. Ivans should not hold too much hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of her hidden understanding is very clear, meet you. It is to see that you are a genius magician with strong elemental will, but the motion is due to the cooperation of the Magic Council with the Elf and the Druid forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Although the potential of the arcane is very high, the future may grow into a legendary magician, but this is only possible and good expectations, he is actually only two The ring magician, the fourth-level arcane master, in the eyes of the wife of Florensha, the great arcane master, but a more optimistic young man, is far from reaching the point of importance and exerting his influence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa smiled eloquently: "As a qualified gentleman, should I ask for dinner together to express my gratitude?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, of course Lucien wanted to say that it was postponed until tomorrow, because he also planned to go to Rentat to meet Ravendi, hoping to influence the elemental will and the organization of the "high tower" by the great master who insisted on the truth, but he Well, I also have a little social experience. I understand that I just answered Verlontha’s work, and I am afraid that I will not sin. Behind her there is a big arcane husband, a nine-ring teacher, and a high-ranking magician who is extremely powerful in combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa saw Lucien’s slightly surprised and cramped response, and couldn’t help but grin: “Evans, you don’t have to be so nervous, Actually, I was joking. My husband Oliver returned from the space tonight. I will have a wonderful candlelight dinner with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is mature The married woman’s language style is always open, and she likes to tease young men, and has no other thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After knowing that Florence was promised to submit the motion, Lucestine and Exeter were relieved, then Send the message back to Stroop Forest in a way that is unique to the elf, hoping to get help from the Elf King and the Druid Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they took a magic steam train with Lucian to the Ranthamholm Royal Magic Tower to meet Ravendi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven is wearing a gray magic robe, with a periodic table pattern on the chest and abdomen, but the symbols inside are different from the earth, full of mysterious and deep taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, I can help you to raise the committee members of the committee, but I don't quite understand your value. The alchemy workshop does. What is the difference between destroying the environment and the farmer's chopping off the forest? We can keep the alchemy workshop away from the city and away from the place where humans live, so that the consequences can be greatly reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laven, who saw the Miller experiment, clearly valued Lucien more than Florence, and he has always valued his arcane talent from the beginning of the periodic table. Unfortunately, he has no concept at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave a general lecture about what might happen in the "inference" and concluded: "Mr. Ravendi, you masters, high-order The magician is certainly not afraid of such a thing. The magic apprentices who can be the cornerstones and the human society that provides talents will be greatly attacked. Although it is not impossible to deal with, why should we wait until the tragedy appears?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I went to the tower's astrologers to provide advice. If things do have the potential to develop to the bad side, then I agree with Evans's suggestion." Inferred for a while based on his own common sense of magic, he has become a little more important, but he can only pay attention to this level. After all, his conception with the druids and elves is still very different, and the world is very broad and unexplored. There are many, many more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the reluctance to speak Lavindi, and the mood was a little more exciting. On the side of Elstin and Exeter also showed a gratifying smile. In front of this, the vice president of the will of the element, the influence of Mr. Evans is mostly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience waited for a long time, Lavindi slowly came back, he consulted the old friends of Gaota with "Fernando's electromagnetic communication", his face slightly Heavy: "According to the predictions of several high-ranking astrologers, they seem to see the sky yellow-green gas, large areas of human and animal death, forests withered and deserted, rivers black and stink. Although this is only a future Maybe, but we should still try to avoid it, Evans, I will help you to convince several members of the committee that I am familiar with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prediction is the most Bad scene? Even if Lucien asks for pre-treatment of pollution, he also believes that the scene in the prophecy is definitely the worst and worst possibility. It will hardly appear. Even if it is an occasional accident, it can make Mr. Lavendi pay attention to it. Why? To debunk it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Lavendi, after leaving his room at the Royal Tower of Holm, Ellerdine sincerely said to Lucien: "Evans Thank you, Mr., for rushing around to protect nature, lobbying for a big man. Your persistence and perseverance in things is something we have never had before. You are a real man."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never bowed under the fate of the arrangement." Lucien said humorously, the premise is not to delay my magical strength, I should concentrate on the next night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
