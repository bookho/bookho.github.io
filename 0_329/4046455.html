			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge is in the air, and the tower used as a stargazing station is towering into the sky, and the dark black tower is smashing from time to time. The doorway is reflected in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Levsky’s words, Lucien’s lips smiled and closed, and then half jokingly said: “The particle theory can’t explain most of the experiments. As a result, the volatility theory can't find the root of its existence. They all have big problems. Why don't they become husband and wife, and combine them together? This will solve everything, and no need to trouble the wave war!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible, Evans is really humorous." Levsky laughed. Although he is more adept at mathematics, it is also a genuine arcane master. He has a certain degree of research on the theory of volatility and particle theory. He only feels that Lucien is joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien and other people who got off the road behind Lucien and others showed a smile on their faces, and Heidi couldn’t help but laugh at himself. come out. Become a husband and wife? Only Evans is good at this inexplicable "cold joke" that no one can appreciate - the quirky compound word created by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien raised his cane: "In short, if there are no other experimental results that determine the surname, it is already the third large-scale 'combat' wave and particles. We can't tell the difference in a short time, we still concentrate on our own research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not worry that his joke will lead to Levski Inspiration from Lazar, Rock and others, jumping out of the centuries, except for the need for bold subversive thinking, also requires a series of experimental support, no those found, no those experimental results, the wave two Unable to be thought of, great as Einstein, his paper is only to propose the concept of light quantum, and to look at light with instantaneous and average, far from the true wave-particle two-image surname, more biased towards particle theory . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will let them produce the quantum hypothesis of light, and see if there isn’t a paper in recent months that attempts to resolve its blackbody radiation formula and energy hypothesis! Almost all arcane masters regard it as a taboo, "expel" it out of their minds, deliberately forget it, in such a situation, what to get inspiration and ideas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Annick and other students who are very admired by Lucien, because the meditation environment has not really formed, the cognition is still very shallow, and the energy hypothesis can be fully accepted. But it also hinders the lack of knowledge of oneself. It has not yet explored the level of heat radiation. There is no opportunity to use and study quantum theory. It is naturally at a stage where it knows and believes that the content is not well understood. It is impossible to apply it to make assumptions about light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense." Levsky nodded seriously. He liked to study two new geometric systems and Douglas's parliamentary man-made. The theory of the planetary experiment shows, "Hello is coming to Anonynis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the president of Gaota Ming, the highest panelist, Jiuhuan The Archmage "Astrologer" Annonis came over from the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annonis wears a gray top hat, tall and majestic, like the most robust warrior, with a bright face and no beard, looks very young, but the pair of faces The deep black eyes of the vicissitudes of life give him the feeling that he has experienced the aging of time and the body and mind are old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Annonis." Lucien and Levski and others respected the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annonis is an unsmiling person, gently beheaded, and his face is serious to the two: "Please come in, you are the protagonist of the party tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, "Starlight" 璀璨, guests gathered, and staggered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien, who entered the hall, soon saw many familiar arcane masters, such as Lavendi, Florencia, Nesica, Milina and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annotation to Levski, Lucien picks up a "star" drink from the tray held by the waiter, toward the will of the element Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the genius of our elemental will is rare, and the genius of the highest honor in three different fields is obtained before the high level." Florensa Laughing lazily, implied a ridicule for Lucien, suggesting that he is busy studying and studying with the Institute of Atomic Research. He has not stepped into the will headquarters or even the branch for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be very interested in making money projects. The magic crystal lights have not been promoted yet, just get this." Gaston smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's first frowns: "Lu Xien, the improvement of magical power and the exploration of the unknown world does require the assistance of huge resources, but this is not The most important thing, the most important thing is to concentrate on learning and research. Don't be busy making money and forget the original intention." He didn't want to see Lucien go the wrong way, so he reminded him that he always said straight away. Not afraid of offending anyone, annoying who. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearing Lavendi, Florencia smiled and said: "Lu Xien has not forgotten research, he has not just established a new geometric system. Isn't it the awarding dinner for his Arcane Scepter Award?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The initial formation work is over, then I will focus on The improvement of magical power." Lu Xien said that the creation of a unique meditation thought, heard the ears of Lavin's first class, but he began to prepare for the impact of high-level, all agreed to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven’s dark gray eyes carefully looked at Lucien, following Florencia’s words: “Before the mathematics field was your arcane ability. A weak link, now it seems that you have made up for it, very good, you have the quality of success. But I do not recommend that you continue to study in the field of new geometry, this can not see the real arcane and magical meaning for the time being, you should be more Studying the problem of complex functions lays a good foundation for the calculation of complex mental fields after high-order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most promising member of the parliament to become a legendary magician. The younger generation, don't waste your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a promise and a persuasion. He knows that Lucian's cognitive world has been initially materialized. In terms of his age and arcane level, it is not too difficult to raise the ranks. It is necessary to lay the most solid foundation for the future impact of the legendary field. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Lucien, the new geometry is still handed over to the towering mathematician who likes mathematics, and later discovers their substantive meanings and uses them directly. As a good friend, K also persuaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a genius, becoming the object of the organization's efforts to cultivate, in addition to the shackles and the dark arrows, it also has to bear too much pressure and misunderstanding caused by too much care, many geniuses The reason why I didn’t go any further was to lose my way under the care and advice of the people around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, kindness will do the wrong thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am making up for this mathematical knowledge." Lucian nodded and replied, "But I always believe that we should pay more attention to the field of mathematics, just like fighting. Before we need more and better equipment. Since we don't know what areas to explore in the next step, it is necessary to prepare more mathematical tools in advance, even if they don't see their arcane meaning for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Lavin was about to talk, and Florenza interrupted him with a smile: "After reading the journal Nature, Oliver on Lucy Your argument is quite agreeable. The field he is currently exploring is not progressing because he can't find a suitable mathematical method. He has a little inspiration until he sees two new geometric systems."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Arcanists agree, Larry, K and others are not much to say, Lucian took the opportunity to transfer the topic: "Is the recent wave war also spread to the organization?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, the internal quarrel is very strong, a few Every day, the magicians are arguing, and some even provoke anger, and the battle broke out, but it was stopped in time, and there were no casualties." Gaston was a little bit annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the elemental will of the Elemental Masters, there are so many magicians who support the volatility, which is enough to prove the dominance of the volatility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there are too many encounters, this circle is also a particle theory supporter, no object of controversy, Gaston does not want to entangle in the wave war, surrounded Looking around for a circle: "The pale hand did not send someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Lucien was a little curious, the invitation of the tower was definitely sent. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa looked around and the voice was low, showing a hoarse surname: "The highest review group and the affairs committee jointly investigated Heidler City and the black and white gray solidified world. In the relationship, the dark hands of the pale hands, the two sides are very stiff, so this time, members of the pale hands expressed silent protests in this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
