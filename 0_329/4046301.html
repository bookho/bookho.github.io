			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Municipal Square, around the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at several famous singers who came out with the adult choir and the children’s choir, standing behind the semicircular band, around People are full of horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did Mr. Fabrini come?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the last one not a symphony, a chorus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......just looking forward to it They are only surprised at this time, completely do not understand what is going on, why are there singers, choirs and children's choirs appearing in Lucien? Evans's concert, and the repertoire is clearly a minor symphony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the surrounding arguments, Betty doubtfully said to her sister Joanna: "Is there a chorus passage in this symphony of Mr. Evans?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? There has never been a symphony with a chorus part! This is not an oratorio!" An Aalto citizen next to him strongly expressed his disbelief. He is a senior symphony enthusiast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that his sister was questioned, Joanna snorted: "Mr. Evans is known for his transformation and innovation, his previous "Destiny" and "The New Country" Is it perfect to conform to the traditional symphony structure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar controversy has taken place in various places in the Plaza Mayor, making people feel like Lucien? The last symphony of Evans became more curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the hall of the sacred hall, watching Fabrini and others sneak out, Christopher said: "He really wants to join the symphony. The vocal chorus part is really bold and innovative. I don’t know what the effect is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lucian’s rehearsal is confidential, the Aalto Musicians’ Association is not big. Fabrini and others are not silent people, so most musicians and musicians have guessed that Lucien wants to use the chorus in the symphony to cooperate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the changes in every piece of Lucian’s music, musicians are taking a wait-and-see attitude, as long as they are not as good as “New Country” They are all looking forward to the innovation of the form of symphony, especially the generous elderly of Christopher, but also like to pay attention to it all, hoping to bring new inspiration to their music creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said to be very good, but it is two different things to rehearse alone and face a large number of audiences in the hall. The effect may be a hundred times better. Natasha is full of confidence, as if she was creating a piece of music and is about to be on her own, and she complained a little bit. "This guy is really good at keeping secrets. It is clear that these two symphonies have already taken shape in the past three years." One of them is closer to completion, but it is not mentioned, is it a surprise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her opinion, "From New World" and "Happy It is obviously impossible for Lucy to return to Aalto for more than a month, and Lucien also admitted to composing some movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Othello shook his head: "But there has never been a vocal chorus in the symphony. How can it be undecided in the end? It is an unknown mystery. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, wearing a tuxedo, handsome and quiet like the moonlight, Lucien walked out from the background with a short baton, pressing the chest in turn salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the discussion in the Hall of the Holy Ghost or on the Plaza Mayor, the silence suddenly stopped and completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the charm of a top musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Turned around and stood in the middle of the semi-circle of the band, Lucien raised his hands and made a gesture of silence and preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used the surname to close your eyes, recall the past sufferings and contemplations, recalling that after a long and arduous journey to the port of Holm Kingdom, the cargo wood suppressed from the dark When the box came out, I saw a scene of Lazar, wearing a black double-breasted long dress and a top hat. At that time, the weather was bright and he smiled brightly. It was like a piercing of darkness and hardship, indicating the sacred sunshine of the coming of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand baton and the virtual hand's left hand are gently undulating, seemingly capturing the feelings and melody from the distance, from the beginning, the low music, as if from the soul vibrato reverberation, a deep, calm, serious The vision of 朦胧 seems to be in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor only feels that the soul has an uncontrollable sense of trepidation under this vibrato, not knowing whether it is from the excitement of this melody, or because it contains Serious and deep awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a sense of trepidation in every person’s heart, including the cardinal, has an initial, profound, and intuitive impression of music. It is grand and serious, and it seems to contain a powerful and unstoppable force. It also shows the sinister coming, which is the difficulty and pain that everyone can't escape, from birth to death! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the power that is contained grows stronger, the music becomes more powerful, the unusually sharp rhythm trembles with the waves, and the other themes are severely suppressed. It seems that the hardships that everyone is unwilling to face, the unwillingness to come, and the fate that is destined at the beginning, the two themes are repeatedly entangled, and the whole first movement has been transformed into a never-ending struggle that runs through "Destiny" and "Sorrow". And the cry of never giving up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some gentle or high-spirited melodies, which are both temporary and calm in the struggle to set off the hardship and tragedy of the battle, as if to reveal the victory over suffering and victory. The enemy and the sacredness and inevitability of defeating the darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first movement of the 16-minute period was when the audience focused on the fascination and the past, and the temporary victory of the struggle ended. They thundered. Applause, unreservedly expressed his love for this movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning is so grand and solemn, deep and solemn, this movement is really outstanding, and the structure is rigorous and firm, very perfect, almost a piece of music without awkwardness!" The music of Othello did not frown like the previous "New Kingdom", but praised him with the words he could think of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha slightly proudly echoes: "If the latter three movements still maintain the same level, then this is the undisputed symphony top It is able to accept the classics of the latecomers at the same level as "Destiny" and "The Twilight War." This concert is really full of greatness, and there are two new works. I am afraid it is difficult to have a similar situation in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Grand Duke of Vaolirit is slightly puzzled: "No matter from any aspect, the first movement is worthy of your praise, but I always feel lacking." What, what is the feeling of shocking outbreak?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, whether it is from the skill, structure, or melody, etc., this movement is all Close to perfection, but it is not as full of the horror and urgency of the violent storms as the first movement of "Fate", and unlike the first chapter of "Sorrow" and "Moonlight" can give people a unique feeling of heart. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher Out of his own senses, "great, deep, grim, etc. It has been revealed, but there is a little something to remember. It is like a volcano with terrorist power. It occasionally erupts, but it does not reach everyone's. It is hoped that it is not such a natural spewing out, giving people a feeling of depression, depression and darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Christopher said it was me. Feeling, but because of this, I am increasingly looking forward to the outbreak of a certain movement, which is the key to whether it can become a true classic." Victor is not eager, still waiting for the next three movements without doubt, but he There is also a hint of darkness and depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sitting of the Earl of Hain, the Count of Lafayette, and the Cardinal Cosset, etc., are difficult to interpret for their musical discussions, but do not hinder them. They agree with Christopher's senses. Although the struggle of the first movement ends with a grand victory that temporarily defeats the enemy and the darkness, they still feel that they are alone in the dark, and there are still many sufferings and sinisters ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the shared feeling of all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the second movement began under the direction of Lucien, and the music must be played in a slow-paced tradition, playing a lively and clear melody. As if to chase the enemy by the previous victory, as if the darkness disappeared for a short time, you can see the bright blue sky and the bright sunshine, giving people a feeling of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He really broke the tradition." Christopher seemed to prematurely and sneer, with the elders indulging the smiles of the younger generation . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the Plaza Mayor found this change as long as they had a little understanding of the symphony, but they were more focused on listening to the essence of music, and they liked the second movement as well, and they felt that the melody was beautiful and the atmosphere was just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the second movement is so good and so ambiguous, it proves that structural changes are necessary! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of the victory is still going on, but the darkness seems to come quietly again, and the enemy seems to be surrounded by all directions, and the hurried melody brings a tense feeling to everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this disturbing mood, the second movement ended, the audience encouraged themselves and inspired Lu Xi’an to erupt again like a wave of applause. It seems that the more enthusiastic the applause, the less lonely they will be, the more they can unite and fight together against darkness and sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few symphonies can get such a warm applause at the pause of each movement! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the applause, everyone did not speak, the deep depression and darkness became more and more intense, and the deep volcano stopped erupting, as if it was accumulating Amazing, horrible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short break and contemplation, Lucien once again leaped the baton, letting the whole band follow his emotions to play the third movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serene, serene melody softly and gently reverberates, leaving people in a quiet contemplation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No musicians to discuss the structure of this movement is no longer Allegro, but a beautiful slowboard, soft like a song. After the struggle of the first two movements, either intense or inspiring or tragic or uneasy, everyone desperately needs a quiet time to think about why they are fighting, thinking about the meaning of their own battles, and recalling the whole struggle. All kinds of sufferings and efforts, thus accumulating new strengths, and harvesting brilliant and joyful victories! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you do everything smoothly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel the joy of your heart after overcoming difficulties? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you struggling with difficulties everywhere in your life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you face them bravely, or are you depressed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... In quiet thinking, Victor once again recalled the hardships of life, and he never became a musician after smoothing:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget everything, lock the music creation in the room, and communicate with the nobles and the musicians’ associations against his inner desires, thus 'praying' to the coming of a concert, But what ushered in was the blow of defeat. It was the unrelenting exit of the audience. It was the ridicule of most people around him. They were almost killed by difficulties and darkness. Fortunately, with the encouragement of Winnie, they could stand up again. After ten times of hard work, I regained the opportunity to hold the concert and gained success. When I had not fulfilled my promise, Winnie was called to the Lord... Natasha thought of the past, she was born noble, bloody top The family and the embarrassment seem to have been favored by the god of truth, but life will never be smooth. In a short period of time, the death of the elder brother, the death of the mother, let the soul close, and carry a heavy Tam, entirely devoted knight of hard training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you find yourself in the spirit of the knight, out of the shadows of the past, ushering in good feelings and new life, a brutal betrayal that could have been avoided On the side of himself, for all those who support and cherish themselves, they have to bear the pain to kill the lover, and almost killed by the cousin's men, fortunately, the good friend of Lucien does not count the life and death of the rescue... The commander Lu Xien is also thinking about all kinds of hardships. The dark past is haunting the heart. They are so depressed and dangerous, but they give themselves the harvest, let them run toward the light and chase the sun. And success, never stop, never give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever had a dark depression and a decadent painful experience? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have learned lessons and strengths from such experiences, are you making stronger progress, or are you degraded and never able to extricate yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you yearn for light and success? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you ready for the darkness and sin on the road to them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknowingly, the third movement ended, and the accumulated bits and pieces made everyone feel unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been too much suffering in life, they can’t wait to rush to the light, to triumph, to succeed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s action fiercely fierce, the fourth movement begins with a volcanic eruption, letting the power of contemplation, brewing low emotions like a flood Be guided out, break through all shackles, defeat all enemies, defeat all sinister! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of outburst has cheered up the audience in the Hall of St. and the Plaza Mayor. It seems that we will soon see a bright dawn and a brilliant victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the darkness is still awkward, the difficulty still exists, and the melody repeats the first three movements in a fragmentary manner, again giving a thrilling struggle and a sense of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not yet won, but also to move on, but also to the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyful melody is played softly by the bass cello, and the solemn, light and clear joyful tone seems to soothe people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough, not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have gone through countless efforts and are close to the edge of victory, but the light is only if it is noticed, it has not really come! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the second concert of Victor, the song has been played, but the audience has not responded, still can not know whether it is successful, the inner depression Expectations, embarrassment and tension still exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyful tone gradually developed into the whole band, more and more vivid, more and more huge, countless streams quickly merged into a torrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough, not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like Lucien has arrived at the port of Padre in the Kingdom of Holm, but the lid of the wooden box has not been uncovered, everything is still In the dark and depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the audience, including Natasha, clenched their fists unconsciously and wanted to cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough, not enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a baritone sings eloquently:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, friends, why bother? Singing old tune?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or let us sing"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chorus!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being struck by lightning, just like witnessing the coming of an angel, the unspeakable tremor is bursting from the depths of everyone’s soul, spreading To the whole body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passionate tribute and the joyful sacred melody flooded, drowning everything, breaking everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy, joyful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy Angels Holy Beauty"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brightness shines on the earth"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The emotions that have been unable to get a complete catharsis are completely spewing at this moment, everyone’s The soul is ethereal because of the touch, full of the ultimate sacred happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like going through the long darkness, seeing the first sun shining through the darkness and the clouds, it is so solemn and solemn, and so Bright and sacred! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just like Victor’s countless difficulties and setbacks, he received a lot of applause and got real success. At that moment, at this moment, his eyes are Full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like the wooden case lid is uncovered, Lucien sat up and saw the smiling Lazar and the clear blue sky, feeling very comfortable and moving All the dangers and depressions of the past seem to have paid off at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without suffering, there is no gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With no hard work, there is no success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without pain, difficulty, and oppression, how can there be such extreme, such pure joy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, people who are shocked by the soul are completely lost in the music, lost in the joyful sings of the four voices, they They all contain moving tears, feeling sincere happiness, and praising the gift of the God of truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this beautiful land"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All living beings have fun"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything people no matter how expensive"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are sacred and graceful"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... sings the singer who seems to praise the God of truth, feels the joy of the sacred music, and sees the audience below, touching the faces of happy and tearful, Fabri Some of the sorrowful feelings of music, the sacred greatness of this song, the sacred greatness of this song, he was inexplicably moved, while singing, while tears slipped through the clean cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From birth to the present, from cruel surgery to hard practice, Fabrini felt the heartfelt joy for the first time, without any impurities, pure The joy given by the God of Truth is so great that people want to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other singers sang, Fabrini took the opportunity to look at the conductor in front of the band, he was so invested, so hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a great musician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was his turn to sing, he became more and more eager and emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends, in the sky"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sacred care of love"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All people sincerely worship"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worship the mercy of the mercy."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the lyrics of the god who seems to be praising the truth, the Cardinal and the pastors who have been touched by the Cardinal and the other pastors, the cross, the cross is painted on the chest, the sac is the Lord synonym! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chorus over and over again, the band played over and over again, the combination of the two is so perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the clear, pure children’s chorus sounds “the holy beauty of the angels, the radiance shines on the earth”, all the audience go out again, from the soul to the body’s shudder, All the previous repression, all sufferings, all efforts and all the hard work, all broke out, completely broke out, hearty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunshine is full of the earth, joy fills the world, and the symphony draws a perfect rest with the direction of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, people suddenly became crazy, applause was like a volcanic eruption, a catastrophe, and they also had excited tears and uncontrollable emotions. Unconsciously rushing toward the front, I seem to want to express my love and reverence in a way that surrounds Lucien and kisses his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the nobles in the Hall of the Holy Ghost did not care about etiquette, and they all got up and rushed toward the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the Municipal Square found that they were only behind the crystal wall, they could only stop moving forward and shouted over and over again:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien? Evans"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien? Evans"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... They seem to feel that the call of the heart can be passed to the Hall of the Holy Ghost and passed to Lucien In the ear, let him know his respect and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
