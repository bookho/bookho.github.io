Finally he put down the paper and pulled his bow tie. Suspiciously: "What do these operations represent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last time he has read the paper several times, to Lucy. The idea of ​​starting from the particle surname and the discontinuous surname is quite appreciated, and it is also joyful for solving many problems of the new alchemy. Over time, this joy does not ferment into satisfaction and happiness, even worse than expected. excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because for the magicians, the solution to a problem often represents a deeper understanding of the arcane field, corresponding to a specific model or law, but Lucian's quantum mechanics is not, after complex calculations, it can indeed get realistic results, and the problems and quantum numbers found during this time can be included, but nothing but this can be more accurately Describe the structure inside the atom, and it can't give you the rules inside. It makes people feel confused, knowing this is the result, but they don't know why it is this result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matrix is ​​like a real gate that guards the world, so mysterious and so cold, all people are excluded, except for elements and alchemy in the field of alchemy The teachers will cheer, and others will not be able to get the new alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The matrix itself is not difficult. In the past, there were similar mathematical tools, but when it was integrated into the complex system of the new alchemy, the operation was very troublesome, especially I have to think about the meaning of this operation.” Douglas shook his head and laughed. “Everyone was locked into the matrix maze by Lucien. Even if he used existing mathematical tools to transform, he could not solve the fundamental problem. The question is, is there any arcane meaning behind it, and whether the derived formula has a specific arcane definition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no matter what, you can't deny it Lucien's great significance of quantum mechanics only takes time to explore its deeper things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not continue to delve into quantum mechanics, but Put it aside and continue his efforts to find the exact solution of the Evans gravitational field equation. He believes that some of the solutions should contain the mystery of the vast starry sky and macroscopic celestial bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if his level of arcane masters is focused on the Arcane, he may take time to study the new alchemy, study the soul problem, study The electromagnetic field, the most important time is still spent on the force field and the star phase. In particular, the general theory of relativity allows him to see the secrets of understanding the vastness of the stars and the hope of finding a path of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as Douglas, most of the arcane masters realized the complexity and cumbersomeness of this new system after they had passed the initial excitement and joy. It is "unfriendly", it seems to be the most reserved lady, coldly rejecting the proximity of all men, not letting others understand her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more arcaneists are starting to have headaches, imagining the internal model of the atom and giving headaches to the inner meaning of Lucien quantum mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one day in the future, they will certainly regret their own intrinsic meaning, and they can’t wait for Lucien to never make this thing, the world’s Reality is also the "destroyed behemoth"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, only a few people are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri quietly read the paper, in the clean and tidy study, I don’t know how long it took, the black tea, snacks, etc. in front of me have not changed, then She frowned slightly and fell into long-term thinking, looking for this system and the two arcane meanings that did not conform to the multiplication law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the temporary gains, she gave up the infinite divergence and decided to start from this new system and solve the atomic problem with two electrons. The promotion completely establishes the correct surname of the new system and compensates for possible problems. On the other hand, it hopes to find the meaning of arcane in practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando accepted the idea of ​​Lucien, giving up the idea of ​​finding a model for the internal structure of the atom, focusing on exploring the meaning of arcane and studying with his own electronic arrangement. Combine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente and Helen combine the exploration of the Arcane meaning of Lucian quantum mechanics with the characteristics of electronically fluctuating surnames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking the papers of Lucien, Brooke nodded lightly, affirmed Lucien's thoughts, and then re-invested in his work, trying to give electrons a wave function. Since the electrons showed the fluctuating surname and the particle surname respectively. And from the perspective of the particle surname can solve the problem of the new alchemy, the direction of the wave should be OK. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something missing?" Brooke wondered suspiciously that the initial wave function was full of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more he derives the wave function, the more he feels that Lucien’s “mathematical advancement” is extremely important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the destruction of the theater, Oliver and him fell into a similar situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of waiting for Douglas, Fernando, Hathaway, Lavendi, etc. Proof of the partial derivation of matrix mechanics, Lucian's quantum mechanics was actually postponed for one month before it was published on "Arcane." Similarly, the electron diffraction experiment to be published in April was postponed to May, otherwise Most of the arcane masters who do not understand complex operations take the judgment of the value of quantum mechanics papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The March issue of the journals allowed the magicians to start thinking about problems in the unknown, and they were amazed at the wonderful angle of Lucien, who accepted the idea without any difficulty. Fernando's incompatibility principle has made Morris, Gaston and other arcane masters who are good at elements and alchemy happy, and seems to find one of the rules for analyzing the reaction of old alchemy. Lucien is doing all aspects of refining legendary items. The preparation, while "Ivans's uncertain hand" is built into the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April, when the "Universal Entrance Examination for Higher Magic Schools" officially began, Lucien appeared in the core area of ​​Nexel Palace, in Na Tasa led to the royal treasure house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost let Affris know that I am going to the royal treasure house." Lucien laughed at Natasha, this guy stalked I don’t use the silver moon medal “superconducting” or “borrowing” to “appreciate”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha has seen the crystal dragon of Aphrodite, and has an intuitive understanding of its greed: "Hey, it will definitely move directly to the treasure house." Settled, the first time I saw the Holm crown ring 'element' in my hand, it also asked me if I was a lady to receive such a beautiful and precious ring, the man can only get the broken 'iron like you Rings, I suspect that if it is a male, most of them will marry a rich man and a wealthy dragon to defraud wealth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal, Natasha smiled and said: "Which piece of material you are ready to pick?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's in the treasure house, Natasha has already been one-fifth Shi Qing clearly told Lu Xien that he would communicate with other legendary powers, hoping to exchange for the materials needed. For this matter, Daoutti can only shake his head with a smile, this kind of secret is generally known to the king or the queen, even the partner will not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a white court dress, Natasha, a simple and refreshing, Lucian nodded: "The dragon stone, Mr. Oliver wants to get It prepares for its future continuation of life rituals, and he has a star nucleus that is suitable for carrying the special ability of the legendary profession of space-time observers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacred stone is produced from the Tomb of the Dragon. There is a dragon that has reached the end of its life. The essence of the rot of the corpse has long condensed into a piece of yellow-brown translucent spar, plus tens of thousands of graves. The lingering death of the year is inflicted with this kind of stone. It has two kinds of life and death. It is one of the most precious materials of the Necromancer. Among them, if the condensed dragon stone is Taigulong, then it It is a legendary material. Although it is not as good as Fernando's direct use of Taigu Long to hold a ceremonial effect, it can last for more than a thousand years. Of course, people below the legend can't bear this effect and will die on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star nucleus is the "relic" of a very small number of collapsed planets in the "Star Tomb". It seems that there is no quality, but under special circumstances, it can break out. Big gravitation, the entire Magic Council, only Oliver still has one - Douglas has ever been, but used to strengthen his own exclusive legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Natasha did not hesitate to open the treasure house and took Lucien with the dragon stone, although this is extremely valuable to continue life. Material, she did not give up a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing with the translucent and semi-solidified yellow-brown spar in his hand, it feels a little green in the inside. Lucien joked: "Don't worry about finding it later." To the material that continues life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
