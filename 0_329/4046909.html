			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This innocent universe presented in hell is deep and dark, with a little bit of light and dreams, resembling "destiny starry sky" and "atomic universe", and they can say something with them. Unclear differences in clearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This starry sky slowly emerges in every place of the nine layers of hell, but has nothing to do with the death swamp, the silent hell, the burning city, the endless canyon, etc. No, it does not affect the actions of the devils at all, like a super large holographic phantom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep and heavy, boundless, making everything unusually small and small with the emergence of the "cosmos", giving people the feeling of looking at the stars at night, even if The most evil and cruel devil, at this time also the empty mind, feel the universe is grand, self-small, the meaning of busy life has become so ridiculous, the only thing worthy of awe and embrace is this vast universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the plots, betrayals, killings, and blood and fires that filled the entire hell were quiet, and the "light" of different colors was entangled. Cheng’s “Ancient Hell” seems to be caught in a slow time and space. Whether it is pain or hate, all kinds of negative emotions are weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven ancient devils stood in the same place, slyly watching Lu Xienzhuang solemnly looking up, "mind" was taken, no first time to attack Fully hinder him from making this unusual move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien did not consider the attack of the seven ancient devils, because he is now in a miraculous state similar to the main material world Viken , can interfere with this world, and is located in other "time and space", can not be touched, can not be attacked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, half-open and half-closed, suddenly opened his arms and made a posture of embracing "Starry Sky". At this time, he was pure soul. Behind the scene, a shadow was slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the shadow was drilled, Lucien’s face changed slightly, keeping the original handsome and revealing a strange ordinary, as if Became another person, an ancient devil who does not care about him, regardless of the breath, or other characteristics will not regard him as a Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Lucien himself is no stranger, because this is himself, the last life of himself, Xia Feng! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer wind entangled in the soul fireplace and the "Lusien face"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadow that had just been drilled from the back of Lucien’s back was backed up with his back, and it’s getting clearer and clearer, and it’s a Lucien, breath and character. They are very vivid, and they will not be wronged by the ancient devils, but this road has no such temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did Lucien split into two? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient devils stared blankly at this scene, completely ignoring what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a gap broke in the void, and a huge and horrible suction came in, pulling the entire "eternal hell" little by little, into the That piece of dark and bright world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Vicken summoning ancient hell is trying to fuse us!" "Pride" devil screamed and screamed, this is just out of the inexplicable Change, there have been more terrible things over there, and where should the ancient devils be able to deal with them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient hell and the ancient devil are two-in-one relationship. If the ancient hell is swallowed and fused, the ancient devils will no longer exist, or there will be one A stronger ancient demon appears, but that is only one side of Viken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "Ancient Hell" is moving slowly and firmly into the evil and sacred world, but Lucien did not respond at all, still maintaining the previous The state, and the "Lu Sien" on the back also opened his arms, doing exactly the same movement as he was in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two souls of Lucien just leaned back and forth with their hands open, and the body of Lucien outside the "gate of desire" collapsed and dispersed. Opened, rushed into the "mind" world, the world of the soul, respectively, into the two roads of Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silent cry, the soul of the two roads is faintly revealed, and the back is entangled in a strange relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real explosion sounded, and the "Lu Sien" soul with the characteristics of the summer wind suddenly opened his eyes and opened the vast universe in every place of hell. "Phantom", the angle of view is far and near, no longer a splendid galaxy, but can really see a huge fireball, a planet of different sizes, one of which is a beautiful blue planet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul with the characteristics of Lucien also opened his eyes at the same time, but the object that his arms embraced turned into a colorful starry sky, then This spread from the "Atomic Universe" starry sky, more and more real, more and more fading, and the perspective is rapidly rising, showing a planet wrapped in "fog". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, these two different universes, different starry sky scenes shrink rapidly, each retaining only a part of it, becoming distinct, just right back to back Grace is the middle line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱吱 吱吱! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has just been completed, and the entire ancient hell is suddenly sinking, making noise that is on the verge of breaking, as if it can not bear the invisible pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant, hypocritical, and other ancient devils face each other and come up with an idea:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lusien? Evans is in the impact of the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his way is very different from Tanos, Viking, and even Douglas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because the cognitive world is different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City of the Sky", in the city of Rentat, absolutely Most of the magicians and civilians looked at the air in desperation. Even the three major gods and the legendary peaks could not prevent the promotion of Viken. Who can stop it now? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, there must be no shortage of magicians and ordinary people to comfort themselves. Wicken’s promotion is not the last, maybe after Wicken’s advancement, as the true God Will be kind to the wisdom of life, will become compassionate and loving, but the madness and degeneration of the "infected" people, the chaos and bloody they create, still remain in their memory, no one will expect to have the title of "disaster king" The Wicken will suddenly change his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at mid-level Viken blends with "Ancient Hell" and "Heavenly Mountain" little by little, looking at Douglas, "Silver Moon", "Hell The attack of the gods and legendary peaks once and for all, in vain, can only break the defense under Wickenb, and he will play the magical state that cannot be touched. The magicians, nobles and civilians are increasingly desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of strong people began to try to fly into that magical field in desperate circumstances, ready to dedicate their own strength, to die better than to die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's integration is only seemingly slow, in fact not dragging, they are still close in the future, the integration seems to have come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the curse has any effect..." In the Atomic Research Institute, Heidi laughed at himself, because of the relationship between Allinge and the magic inside. The teacher has no way to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick casually said: "This does not mean a breakthrough success, at least there is no real name change in the form of Viken."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s not necessary to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third general school, although the students could not understand such high-end battles, Viken always existed, was not eliminated, and made a crazy laugh. The facts let them clearly understand the situation and a heart is sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Ali narrowed his eyes and blurted out: "There seems to be a starry sky in ancient hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The ancient hell", they have just learned from the radio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
