			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the red-eyed eyes of the monster looked at Charlotte, Lucien at the side of the back found that Charlotte’s expression suddenly solidified, and the body’s re-blessing of Douglas The magical runes on the spell absorbing wall are swollen and broken, and the transparent light wall collapses instantly, and then a black mist will cover him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change is so fast, Lucien and Sandra have no time to react and have no time to cast magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black fog swelled and dissipated, and a black pig appeared on the ground, and its eyes were incomparably in a circle, and the thin tail was shaken. Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malicious deformation! You must kill this monster before climbing out of the brazier!" This is Sandra's heart connection to Lucien's heart. The idea, at the same time, under the ceiling of the restraint, it became black and pressed, and a lead cloud covering the entire room condensed, and then a silver-white lightning in the lead cloud continued to squat down, turning the bondage into a forest of thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electromagnetic system four-ring magic "Thundercloud"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien also condensed a red red fireball in front of him, slamming the monster to the center of the "Silver Forest". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it may be immune to flames, it may be blurry and not afraid of explosion shocks, but the summoning array and the brazier are really there, as long as they are "the fireball of Lucien" "Destruction, the monster will no longer have the ability to resurrect, and it can not be resurrected. Even if it has the strength of the five rings, Charlotte, Sandra, and the magic and magical objects are only powerful in their own strength. There is no advantage in the presence of Lucien, who has magical and horrible horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien also cautiously did not directly stimulate the "element" ring, condensing the elemental vortex, because until now, not sure about the identity of the monster, it is not clear Whether it is a demon, a devil, or a purely spiritual body, a mysterious monster of consciousness. If it is the latter, the elemental vortex will not only have no effect but will make Lucien lose its fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flames are about to fall, making an astonishing explosion and horrifying waves, but a darkness rises from the center and expands rapidly. Wrap the entire Thunder Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fireball of Lucien" flew into the darkness, and there was no movement or noise, so it was so swallowed by the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the darkness seems to be a lot weaker, and the silver and white lightnings are faintly visible, and both seem to be competing for space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra's lips are half-opened, and the darkness in the bondage is suddenly twisted and twisted by the invisible force, and the lightning is condensed by Thundercloud. Rolled into the center toward the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electromagnetic system four-ring magic "twisting magnetic field"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Lucien’s right hand holding the coral wand points to the monster in the center, using it to condense the spirit and help the magician lock the enemy. The role of a two-ring magic "Beatful Blessing", which belongs to the small field of the interstellar, dead, and light-dark crosses, establishes a magical fate connection between the magician and the enemy. When the other party is hurt, The magician gains vitality, mental power, attack power, and defense ability, and further weakens the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, only similar magic can penetrate the "distorted magnetic field". Like "Luce's big fireball", I am afraid that when I fly into the magnetic field, it will keep changing. The strong magnetic effect is torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being hit by a rolling lightning ball, the monster erupted with a hoarse but extremely uneasy scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of Sandra's sole slammed into her, and grabbed her ankle and pulled it toward a deep well that appeared like a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah!" Sandra’s subconscious screams were interrupted in an instant, and the shadowing well seemed to have an unimaginable lightning sea. Sandra was dragged into the shadows without warning, and Lucien was unexpected. Is it advanced attack or save her first? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distorted darkness and lightning ball did not accidentally collapse, and there was a black gas on the monster, which seemed to have long anticipated that Lucien would take the opportunity to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, the surrounding atmosphere seems to be calm and solemn, and the blackness surrounding the monster rises and disappears without warning, even the gorgeous black it wears. The robes also blew open a strip of silence, revealing the carrion that was covered with white mites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another corner of the bondage, Charlotte’s figure slowly emerged, in stark contrast to the black pig at the door of the room, his face pale, white shirt With a brown vest, the black battle mage robes disappear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white gloves in front of their right hand made a weird page with mysterious words in front of them, and then disappeared quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change is a four-ring magic "Demon Elegy"! Belong to the magic of the Magic Council! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Charlotte is using some magical effect of his magic robe or some unique magic of his own to escape the "malicious transformation" and then at the most The key moment gave the monster an unexpected blow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the monster's painful cry, Lucian only felt refreshed, exhausted, and decisively seized the opportunity to inspire "the shackles." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A red flame-like light descended from the sky and hit the monster unbiased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dazzling and sacred glory, the monster's gorgeous black robes are smouldering, and most of the body's carrion and locusts are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past is a five-level, after the foundation of the Pope transformation is a four-level magical "flame"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucian’s offense is not over. When the monster tries to resist the purification of the flames, the left hand is pointing to the brazier in the center of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before summoning the Faction’s own defense system has been destroyed by Thundercloud and distorted magnetic fields, this attack is able to directly attack the brazier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster who saw Lucine’s action screamed angrily, and the body faded into a cloud of black fog, dragging the flames of flames to the brazier, trying to stop The destruction of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is very close, the brazier itself has been summoned and transformed, becoming as hard as the second and third level of magical armor, completely able to withstand the strike of Lucien Not completely destroyed, so there is a great possibility of regaining and protecting it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes it unbelievable is that with Lucian’s finger, the inside of the brazier immediately slams the ugly sound, and the light of different colors flashes on it. Then Huo Di swells and decomposes, and a small piece of a small piece of different colors scatters on all sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rings have unique magic, "Elemental Order"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster stunned, but soon it was re-agglomerated into solids by the black fog, and a sulphur-like flame erupted from the body, and the carrion bones seemed to be Expanded as restricted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" Lucien once again ignited the "Strong Flame Shield", a layer of golden flame burning on the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra in the shadow of the well just got rid of the entanglement of his own shadow and climbed out to see this scene, the subconscious once again applied "Palmera's energy method ball ", surrounded by myself and Susan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Charlotte did not hesitate, "Douglas's Spell Absorbing Wall" emerged out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumbling, Lu Xien’s ears creaked, and the black smoke in front of him was tumbling with dangerous waves, and there was also a rotten stench. Corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful flame shield keeps shaking in the blast of the explosion, although it has no effect against the spirit and soul attack, but it still shows five The role of the ring magic, even if the explosion is horrible, it is only faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion stopped, the smoke dissipated, and the bondage was blown up, the bodies were completely broken into pieces of meat, and the summoned array on the ground was completely destroyed. Even the walls with strong defensive arrays collapsed, and they could directly see the thin fog that slowly disappeared outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
