			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magicians are immersed in and cherish the glory of the past, Douglas’s voice is more solemn: “Glorious victory, the ancient legendary magician pursues more persistently Power, to the abyss, to hell, to all kinds of different space conquests, until the truth of the gods grow, in just a few hundred years, the three magical empire is destroyed, the glory of the past has become the bitterness, sorrow and despair of today." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the past is suddenly broken, the cruel reality is cold, and the magicians of different organizations such as Owen and Elika are like a bowl of cold water. Although psychologically prepared, there was a feeling of depression, sigh, and sorrow. It was speculated that Douglas had the same intentions as Anord and the other, using a glorious past and a tragic reality as a contrast to evoke every magic. The teacher is united, strong, and hopeful for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the church is too strong, and there are angels coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cycle of the magicians becoming stronger has not been lengthened, but it seems to be too long and long compared to the clergy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the union really useful? If the goal is big, it will be easy to be stared and annihilated! It may be safer to disperse and hide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only by ensuring that you can live, you can find ways and extraordinary creatures. We work together to study them and break through the limits of magical development..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of ideas come to mind, brewing in the minds of seemingly silent wizards, even sitting on the stage The leaders of the organizations such as Nielsen and Plyhill have similar emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are working hard to develop their own organizations, seek opportunities to survive, and make initial cooperation for a better future. But whoever wants to say that this is full of confidence, who wants to say that there is no fear or fear in the heart, it is absolutely deceptive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why they can move forward with relative enthusiasm and confidence is that, apart from this, there is no second way, no choice People will always be firmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, trusting in the church and becoming a night watcher is also a way out. For the leaders of these organizations. They really are not willing to give up their self before the dust of the Western War, and become a dog in the church. Maybe Alto can really hold on to it? And if Aalto falls, most of the legendary dying. It seems that there is not much value in investing and surrendering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annod is similar to their minds. Satisfied with Douglas's speech and nodded. Fernando secretly snarled, he just said nonsense to say these empty words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas pressed his right hand and used gestures to enhance his tone: "Dear gentlemen, ladies. It’s time to be quiet, don’t be fooled by power. I should calm down and think about some problems." - In the ancient magical empire, only the "sex" of the magician, there is no custom of the sage, so the speech has always been the order of Mrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amount? Thinking about what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians, including Congers and other strong men, have stunned and thought about the joint problem? He is really radical! But what does this have to do with being enchanted by power? Is it to emphasize that unity is better than strength? Just kidding, everyone here is united, not enough to kill a "heart of time"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their doubts, Douglas’s voice suddenly grew louder and louder throughout the hall:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "We need to figure out:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the essence of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why do creatures have spiritual power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the essence of mental power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In what form does it exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is Fernando, and half-mouthed to look at Douglas, what is the problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first heard it, they only felt ridiculous and ridiculous. They changed the middle and low-level mages to ask them. They would definitely interrupt each other rudely, but now they are speaking a sergeant, a clerk who knows "time to stop". This is the most powerful force in the case that the legendary lords are hidden! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they listened patiently, and gradually found that they could not answer these questions! Moreover, after careful consideration, it seems that these problems really need to be researched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle and high-level magicians like Elika underneath look at each other with a funny look. If you can think about these essential problems, you and others will have become legendary magic. Teacher, do you still need Mr. Douglas to remind you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this series of questions also made them feel a little shocked, the subconscious mind straightened back, focused on Douglas, listening to his speech, after all, he was a A ** division, perhaps not in Antwerp, but the scene is a strong figure who can be ranked in the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando frowned slightly, thinking about the answers to these questions, and found himself without a clue, then he found that Douglas exudes an unspeakable The momentum is no longer as gentle as it is in the usual time, or indulging in the spirit of the problem, more majestic, more solemn and solemn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sounds louder and more vigorously continues to speak:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is wind, water or not a basic element? If so, what form and law do they form this wonderful world? If not, what are they? What should magic elements be?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the essence of the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the soul and consciousness different? If so, what form does consciousness exist?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do we need 'tools' to explain and help build magic models?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Does it exist, if it exists, what is his nature and form of existence? What is the form of existence of the vampire ancestor Etna, why can't it die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Why do the world have the sun and the silver moon, why do they rise and fall every day, what is the power to keep them running? In the qualitative world, these seemingly normal things, if we ask more questions, we will find that the reason we do not understand, these principles, laws and knowledge, whether it is related to magic, whether it can be combined with magic. Can it help? We explore the essence of the magical world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him throwing questions one by one, whether it is the strong on the stage or the magician under the stage, the expressions are Gradually, there have been changes, from disdain to thoughtful thinking, to difficult to hide, excitement and excitement, especially the last question about the sun, the silver moon, and the west, like a lightning strikes them, let them all There is a feeling of trepidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Why is this so? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why haven’t I thought about these issues before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These seem to be the laws and essences of the world. What is the secret of the phenomenon that does not need to be questioned? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando clenched his fists, and the bright red pupil was full of excitement. He looked at Douglas's back. For the first time, he thought this guy was really tall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar questions have actually passed by in every magician study. But those who are used to these phenomena have never regarded them as things that need attention. I have never "inquired" so deeply. At this time, listening to Douglas’s speech, they all had the feeling that the fog was pierced by the sun. It turned out that our research on the world of magic is so superficial! There are so many "why" not solved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just noticed that they were suddenly open. There seems to be a new door to open, and the new field of magic is faintly presented, which makes more and more people shudder and reveal a contemplative expression. Even Owen, who was full of resentment against Douglas, feels that the other side is no longer visible. I feel that "why" is full of the ultimate charm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has one problem after another in his mind, what is lightning? Why can't metal block and wood? Why do humans have sex? Why can't people float directly in the air, but stand firmly on the ground? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
