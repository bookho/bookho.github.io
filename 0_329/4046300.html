			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto, Civic Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the road, Sean is greeted nine times in the tsunami-like applause of the mountains, witnessing him return to the background to rest and prepare the most important symphony of the concert. After the song, the tens of thousands of ordinary citizens, businessmen, and adventurers around the crystal wall have calmed down a lot, but the hard-to-remove homesickness makes them unable to be quiet, such as a 60-year-old man. I keep grabbing the people around me and telling my inner feelings:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you don't know, I am from the Shaq Kingdom, which is near the Free City Federation in the southern part of the mainland. A country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have an excellent navy, a brave warrior. When I was young, I was trained on a battleship and annihilated the damn pirate." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most dissatisfied thing I have in Aalto is that the spirits are not tasted enough, and there is no burning throat and stomach feeling of Pellet. Snow wine made from exotic grapes on alpine peaks, naturally cold, It’s so sweet, it’s never forgotten after a sip, but it’s a speciality in my hometown of Lucia, only the Earl of Lucia and our king can enjoy it, and I used to be the gatekeeper of the Count of Lucia, fortunate enough to He secretly tasted a glass of remnant when he was at the wedding..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello, you listened to me, I haven’t talked about Lucia pork sauce. , sheep cheese, honey and roast lamb, have not talked about the enthusiasm of the Shaq Kingdom girls, they chase the warriors who can beat the bulls and monsters..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chattering old man let the middle-aged man next to him shook his head in disgust. This guy was too embarrassed to interrupt his nostalgia for his hometown, and that he was the only one who could prove the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was very reluctant to watch the middle-aged man avoiding himself, muttering to himself: "I have not said that I have a country house in Lucia. The green vines are covered with walls, and the pale yellow flowers are more beautiful than any kind of flowers. The floor in the corner of the hut should have been lifted, but I can't go home to repair, because I have been away there for more than 30 years, the body is early It’s weak, it’s very likely to die on the way home...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is getting low, his eyes seem to have turbid tears, his mouth is not stopping Kneeling: "Go home, go home? Go home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the determined old man’s hands violently waved, scared the Greenton one jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old gentleman, what's wrong with you?" Greenton was thinking about his home town on the border of the Vaurit commune, subconsciously asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and said: "I am going home, I am going home!" He was radiant and energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he smiled and added: "I can hear the symphony of Mr. Lucian Evans when I have not died yet. Unfortunately, his music seems to find some folk tunes, but it is perfectly integrated into the symphony, which is such a melodious classic. Oh, when I return home, I begin to miss Aalto, maybe I miss it first. It’s the great and great work of Mr. Evans and his department.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You’re right!” Hearing the old man’s praise, Greenton was very happy. "At the end of the first movement of the Symphony of the New Country, I thought it was just above a level. It was barely an excellent work, and maybe it would be slammed by critics, but After the second movement was played, I never doubted that this is a better than excellent, enough to call it a great classic, maybe only a little bit can be compared with "Destiny"." Probably because often Back home, Greenton It is to put "Destiny" that I prefer more. I used the usual hand of Capricorn to compare a small and very small meaning. "Mr. Evans is definitely the best and most talented music in the last two decades. Home!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sigh, Greenton came up with a question: "These works are placed in the penultimate, and finally called "Ode to Joy" What kind of work does the d minor symphony be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destiny" is first placed from its past works, used to express return The meaning of this, so no one has doubts, and the arrangement of the latter two symphonies is not yet heard by people, but no one has to guess and worry about it, but after the "new country" completely touched people's minds They found that such a great new work is not the finale, not at the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Me too. It's really looking forward to it!" Greenton turned to look at the crystal wall and watched the band being trimmed. The tone was a bit ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty and others on the square have almost noticed this problem, began to pack their minds, waiting for the beginning of the last symphony with hope, from the heart It is considered to be an outstanding and great work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They seem to be completely worried about such expectations, such hopes will yield disappointing endings, no worry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena quietly wiped her tears, then glanced at Joel and Eliza, who were still intoxicated, whispering to Felice: "I From this music, I heard the thoughts of Lucien’s three years of travel, the thoughts of my hometown, and the thoughts of my friends. They are so sincere that they have completely touched my heart. This is really rich. A moving melody of power, I think it will be passed to a distant place by a traveler and passed down from generation to generation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis eyes are the same Reddish: "This reminds me of the experience of following the tour of Victor's teacher. I didn't think it was at first, but with the passing of a month and a month, I couldn't help me to miss my parents, miss my Bern manor, miss me. Beautiful bedroom, miss my dolls, miss my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tried to turn this thought and my thought into music, Elena The piano piece I have heard is one of the best creations, but it is better than the road. Enlai, there is really a lot of difference. Before I heard this symphony today, I couldn’t imagine that thoughts and thoughts could be displayed in this way, which gave me countless inspirations.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she is more self-satisfied and more solemn: "I found that I admire Lucien..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning music together, witnessing the way The first classmate of Sean’s rookie, even if she was shocked by "Fate", she was touched by the "G Major Strings Serenade" as a gift of oysters. She also resonated with "Sorrow" and only thought that Lucien Talented, very optimistic about his future and respect for the status of his top musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after this same emotion and the contrast of the same inspiration, Felice felt that she really began to worship Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too." Elena answered with a serious smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis put his right hand on the low-cut dress, hehe smiled: "Let's look forward to the last symphony, hope Lucy En can make us more admired!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Grace told me that Mr. Franz and Mr. Fabrini are all about "Ode to Joy" Very respected, compared with the "new country" is also respected." Elena said what she heard, and then smiled: "He will not let us down. I hope that when I am old, I can rely on On the sofa next to the fireplace, tell my grandson that your grandmother used to be a friend of the great musician, music master, and legendary music..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;............in the VIP box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the words of Master Christopher, Natasha smiled: "Mr. President, don't you leave without completing the religious music?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the taste of my hometown can give me more inspiration." Christopher laughed calmly. "His Royal Highness, Lucien communicates with you." Didn't mention this work, I think you seem to hear it for the first time, and feel the same with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stunned Grinning, picking an eyebrow: "No, he will keep it secret. But from the things he asked, from the lines between his words, I can clearly feel the kind of thoughts, my thoughts about my hometown and my family and friends, so I heard this. When I was in the symphony, I was not surprised. I also had a premonition about it. Of course, I have different feelings from Mr. President. Aalto is my hometown. My memory belongs here. Lucien’s melodies just let me Reminiscent of some childhood memories and the experience of traveling in the Kingdom of Holm."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Ouerit also nodded, although the desolation and melancholy melody reminded him of many memories, but he was born in Aalto and grew up in Aalto. Too straight to the homesickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
