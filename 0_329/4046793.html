			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is cool but the air is high and the sky is wide. This is the golden moon of Allinge. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I like Allinge's October most..." Commission member Tom scored with his own red cup and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window. The scenery outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While sighing, he turned and pushed the golden silk on the bridge of his nose, and his student Conden said: "Just knock the door and come in." "You are in a hurry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup is easygoing, and it’s a joy to friends, students, and subordinates. It doesn’t pay much attention to etiquette, so it’s rushing in. There is not too much blame for the behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, he closed the task report on the desk. This is the rule of the committee. People who should not see it, even their own students, Can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mission report is the one submitted by Katrina. Because the "causes and consequences" of the "worship of the devil" have been clearly investigated by her, so this The report was not taken seriously in the mission area. After the high-ranking magician who was on duty was turned over at random, he thought that the matter was correct and that the Katrina mission was completed, and the report naturally fell into the archives. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soup itself attaches great importance to this "worship demon event" because it has been in Lentstadt, in Cuxhad, in the four countries of the Straits in recent years. A series of similar events, such as the ancient devils and the Duke of the Devil, which occurred in the coastal corridor of the Northland, have a certain degree of similarity, but they are essentially different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after he was busy with the matter at hand, he adjusted the report and prepared for detailed analysis and comparison to see if there really is a demon. The king also began to develop the power of faith. Or have other purposes, and most importantly, he wants to understand whether the incident is independent or complements a series of events that take place within the rules of the Magic Council. So find the "reported dead bird" behind the scenes, other book friends are watching:. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, from this report, we can only see the fact that a great knight enhances his strength by worshipping demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, some of the details are too coincidental, but the party is completely dead, and it has been so long. It is basically impossible to continue the investigation. Is it possible? I can also go to the abyss and ask the 'Dark Lord'. Is the prince Andre worshiping you? Or grab the 'Death Storm' Ninell and let him truthfully accept the Viscount Andreas as a student. ?? The right hand of the soup spectrum is covered on the report, and the index finger is gently tapped. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of his face, Camden is a young, thin man. The cheeks are sunken. The skin is "burned" into a dark red like the sun is too much. The right eye is very fashionable to wear a single piece of glasses, the sound is so fast as the rain hits the leaves: "I'm sorry, teacher. After I knocked, the door opened a gap, I thought you let me in. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum is very familiar with the impetuous but honest character of the students, and doubts: "The door opened itself, I did not close?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, hey, I met Affris in the hallway, and it looked like it was very satisfying..." Conden suddenly remembered one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soup broke his teeth with a distressed heart: "...no matter what, what's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He had a gamble with Affris some time ago, thinking that he is close to the Nine Rings and is unlikely to be deceived by Affleck's illusion. Especially in the Allinge Magic Tower, so if Affris can help take any other things from his office without the help of others, he would have to open the treasure chest and let it pick a lot of gems. Now it seems... ...but it's good, you can relax your vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, Evans submitted a paper called "Determinism, Self-Awareness, and Magical Roots," which built a model of the essence of magic, although There are a lot of problems that have not been solved, such as why the magic pattern can help communicate the 'real world', what is the function of it, but it also opens a new door for us to study the essence of magic and extraordinary power... The Arcane Library accidentally discovered this paper and immediately caused a sensation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comward seems a little excited, coupled with an impetuous character, a series of words As the storm blew, I heard that the soup spectrum almost responded: "Stop and stop, give me the paper first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a paper borrowed by Condon, the soup scored a date, surprised and relieved: "Is it submitted three days ago? No wonder is not listed on "Arcane" or "Magic"..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, as long as the Arcan Master’s thesis has a certain value, the journal will not refuse, and will rush, but Lucien is basically only published in the Arcane. "On Nature" and "Elements", occasionally write a draft for the "Organic Arcanist Monthly", so such an important paper, "Arcane" will certainly not let go, and because it is about the essence of magic, "magic The journal will obviously not be allowed to be published by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to look down, frowning on the front part, the determinism seems to be stormy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the explanation of Lucien, his brow is completely stretched out, pushing the gold-rimmed glasses from time to time, whispering: "Observer effect It’s not completely ridiculous... The material foundation is not 'firm', this is very novel, but if this is the case, why is it normal in the absence of magic and extraordinary power, is it still blamed on micro The transition from the level to the mysterious stage at the macro level... Hey, Lucien also thinks about this... weak observers and strong observers...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is completely Immersed in this paper, even though this paper has not been confirmed by any experiments and phenomena, the "observer effect" is also rejected by the mainstream of the parliament, but its logic is self-consistent, it seems that there is such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication to the teacher, Conden was not surprised, picked up the feather pen on the table, and recorded some questions and opinions of the teacher on the draft paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The energy to replenish mental energy comes from the 'real world'? The extra material in the magic comes from the 'real world'?咦..." I seem to think of something. I quickly turned around and pulled out the "Elements" of this issue from the bookshelf. Then he held the eyes of Jinsi, and the tone was quite shocking. "This is not the 'negative energy vacuum sea' that can be solved. Question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the arcane master who saw this paper at the time couldn't help but think of the 'negative energy vacuum sea', which just solved the problem. The most fundamental questions in this essay on the nature of magic, other book friends are watching:!" Kang Deng's ears are sharp, and he heard the teacher's self-talk, very excited to say, "They are in tandem, A source of magical energy, a conjecture about the nature of magic, together constitutes a complete magic system!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic system he said The spell system is not the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably the first formal magical nature model with theoretical support since magic, and it should be the model of all extraordinary powers." Was contaminated with a trace of excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the history of magic, the earliest magician has already issued a question about what the essence of magic is, and put forward his own ideas, such as the four elements of geothermal feng shui System - Ancient magicians built a conjecture about the bottom of the world, arguing that there is an energy plane consisting entirely of the same element, and named it the fire element kingdom, the water element ocean, etc., such as the root system - they think there is magic The root of it, it is a true part of the world...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These magical landscapes still affect the generation of magicians until today, the nouns such as fire elements are a testimony, However, the ancient magicians did not explore the world enough. The magical paintings were all imaginary, without any theoretical basis, belonging to the fantasy level, not the model in the definition of arcane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heyday of the ancient magical empire, the magician pays more attention to normal research and application. No one is going to think about the imaginary essence of magic. Anyway, knowing that spiritual power is exerting The conditions of magic will do, so even if the greatness is like the Sun King Tanos, there is no magical essence model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of the Magic Council, the essence of magic has been studied, but due to other theoretical deficiencies, the progress of this research is very slow, so the rigorous Douglas et al. I rushed to propose my own magical nature model, so as not to have a fanciful idea to influence other arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Tang Pei really saw a model that described magic from its essence and roots, and it was built on the most cutting-edge results of the current micro-domain. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the model is correct or not, it has a significant historical significance... The soup spectrum is a bit awkward, and once again witnessed history, this is the last ten It seems to happen often for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
