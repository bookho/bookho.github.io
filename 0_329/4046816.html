			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the barrier of the air, the magician’s mental power spreads more comfortably and less decays, so the scope of the spiritual field is wider, and the ground is full. Tens of times, but in such a wide range, Lucien and others can only sense the law of a man-made planet but operate alone. The whole environment is lonely and lonely. This is the most intuitive of the real universe outside the atmosphere. Feel. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such an orbit, Lucien, Douglas, Fernando, and Helen, who float around the artificial planet, are so small, but full of people that cannot be ignored. Breath, as if they are small suns, the secret of nature, the hell of the Thunder, the universe within the atom and the illusion of ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magician's mental field is fully developed, and the semi-cured cognitive world will interfere with reality with the half-plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a quiet and bleak environment, Lucien smiled and answered Helen’s question: “Because I want the church to imitate us in the field we are good at, chasing us. Competing with us, rather than focusing on so-called theological studies, once they focus on this, they may find a way to fully apply 'Heavenly Mountain'."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen nodded thoughtfully: "So, the important role of the artificial planet is to make the church distracted from its strengths, and we are not good at them at all, and we have a deep understanding. The field competes with us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, although they may not be able to study the mystery of Heaven Mountain, but before we have the overwhelming advantage, we can eliminate the accident. Good to stop." Lu Xien gently beheaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you are not worried about the secrets of the artificial planet, the situation will deteriorate rapidly? It can have an extremely important role, and it is a strategic level weapon that you often say. Turn ordinary air into a planetary-level orbital control." Douglas asked with a smile and awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "air control" is not difficult to understand for the Magic Council. The "city of the sky" itself is a product of air production, but it is not summarized into a concept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said gently: "The role of artificial planets is really great, but the parts we have developed and can use now are few of them. Before solving the energy problem, it can only play the auxiliary role of signal transmission, monitoring and terrain mapping. It is not the key to determine the outcome. The most important one is the transmission of signals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the church, due to the extensive arrangement of image transmission arrays, the control area opposite the Storm Channel, the level of the middle-level clergy can basically achieve the effect of using artificial planets, and is occupied by us and the northern church. The place, originally, but not now, as for the live broadcast, etc., how can they let the ordinary people enjoy it? For them, the ordinary people know the less the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"They value the potential value of the signal transmission of artificial planets, and the parts that can be used at the moment can restore them to the pre-war situation of Rantat. For us, this is not Especially bad changes, and we have a thorough understanding of the principles and details of the artificial planet, can't we limit the artificial planet of the church, can't 'invade' it, steal communication secrets? This is the area we are familiar with and good at!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Lucien suddenly thought of a sentence and smiled and said: "In a simple sentence, it is to pull the enemy into the field we are familiar with, and then Destroy them with our extensive experience and in-depth research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magic is borrowing the power of 'Tanos', which is more convenient than us in orbit. If they imitate a man-made planet, they will have an attack and defense that is better than ours. Are you afraid of being overtaken by them?" Fernando, next to Lucien, swayed his face from the "runaway reactor" of Lucien. hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xienhe smiled and said: "If the church is another council, it has its own arcane system, with arcane points, arcane points, etc. that encourage research. Things, with hundreds of thousands of years of accumulation of arcane and magical knowledge, with in-depth research in many fields, such as macro and micro, have a very strong exploration and research atmosphere, then I will not make this suggestion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not absolute. In the case of similar arcane bases, this kind of "Star Wars" can also be used to transform confrontation into an overall economic confrontation. In short, Which aspect of the competition is strong with the other side, not the other way around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their artificial planets may have a relatively strong attacking power, but before they can really play the role of 'Heavenly Mountain', they will not be able to play the role of orbital bombing, and our nuclear fission reactor may not be able to be in a year or two. Success, miniaturization will not be inferior to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s like you can only wait for the church to die, our future is bright." Douglas laughed. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien snorted: "The future is bright, but the road is tortuous. In fact, in this respect, you must have the same name as the Speaker. The views are not specifically mentioned. For example, the papers on arcane research are all published. The church and the country can see it as long as they have the heart. The magic only has the principle and the idea. The specific structure must have the corresponding authority. Check and redeem, so that they can understand the arcane, hope to catch up, but never catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was not so much at the beginning, purely hug The system of ideas that they simply can't understand. Douglas is very honest and self-deprecating. "In my opinion, without my own research and exploration, without long-term accumulation, it is useless to read the paper directly, so it is big. It is impossible for some clergy and national powers to get anything from our open arcane thesis. However, I did not expect the Pope to be Viken, but still maintain a strong learning attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen suddenly said: "Evans has spent a great price on every artificial planet with a 'runaway reactor', in order to make the church impossible. Get?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, the easier it is to get, the less cherished, the more they will doubt our true purpose, so we must let them go through hardships and obstacles. At the great cost, such access will make them willing to spend more energy to imitate and transform." Lucian shakes his head and hates the iron and looks like steel. "Who knows that they have no fighting spirit." I originally hoped that they would exchange the life of a priest of the Holy Spirit for the secret of the artificial planet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas also sighed: "Then we have to find a way to let the church Get the 'opportunity' again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also seems to agree with Lucian’s idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you ensure that the church will be willing to venture into a man-made planet, and will definitely focus on imitating and transforming it?" Fernando said cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they don’t capture the artificial planet and study its secrets, they will watch as we gradually play the full role of the artificial planet, control the orbit, and control the planet. And then eliminated by the times, but this time will be relatively long, will be filled with some changes, and if they compete with us in this field, things will enter our familiar track." Lucien answered with serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas once again laughed: "Sure enough, the future is bright, no matter how the church decides, it cannot avoid failure. This is the choice of the times, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly sighed, and Lucien did the same. He spit out a gas that did not exist in the universe without air, and almost simultaneously said:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Class-like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is no such thing as the existence of the undead mystery, why is the Parliament? The church is bent around and the church has been fully developed, and the church will be destroyed in a short time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the road is tortuous. Maybe when the parliament is destroyed by several gods, maybe before we see the victory, we Someone will fall forever in the spirit of the gods." Lucien Sumu did not fear to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looks at the vast expanse of the stars: "Although the impact of the gods is important, no matter what, the development of the parliament must be based on the study of arcane and the application of magic. Because our path of the gods must be built on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando and Helen nodded at the same time, agreeing with Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, what kind of plan do we have?" Douglas looked at Lucien and asked for his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "Maybe this plan can catch the hidden dangers inside the parliament. Before the southern church evacuates the four countries of the Straits and the coastal corridors of the North, There were a lot of church spies in the parliament. Afterwards, the situation improved, and this situation was basically eliminated. However, as Vikan secretly announced the mystery of the gods, I suspect that there are people in the parliament and the church is not convinced."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
