			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes are very innocent: “I just got ideas from the wonderful result of electronically having a fluctuating surname, and revised and abandoned some of the ideas of the past.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it a wave to deal with orbital problems?" Fernando knew that this would naturally lead to the orbit of quantization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "This will not solve the problem, but I have another idea. When this road does not work, I will go back. From the perspective of volatility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not from the perspective of electronic waves?" During the discussion of Arcane, Fernando has always been serious, and some do not understand that Lucien can still What is the result of this experiment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said very seriously: "It is the thinking surname contained in this phenomenon, that is, what I have previously stated can only rely on what can be observed." Phenomena and results to deal with problems inside the atom' cannot be based on the original concept that cannot be directly observed, such as orbit, as we can only describe electrons with fluctuating surnames and particle surnames."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then use mathematical tools to derive?" Fernando said with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded: "Yes, don't consider the arcane meaning of some things, use mathematical tools to solve the problems inside the atom and the real world. Connected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say that you can't simply equate the micro-domain with the real world?" Fernando was a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "So in mathematics, the microcosm and the real world do each follow different laws, but when the laws of the microworld extend to reality In the world, the observations must be consistent with the classical laws. Otherwise, we cannot explain why all of us can exist in reality, not become waves. Therefore, we temporarily do not consider the arcane meaning of this law change, and construct a mathematical tool through pure mathematics. A model similar to the classical theory, the solution is consistent with the experimental results, and finally the actual symbol of the model is discussed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most primitive and classic method, But we have forgotten it for a long time.” Fernando sighed with a rare sigh. In the beginning, when many concepts were not formed, many theories were such that they explored the results of the world, built experimental functions, and explored the practical meaning of functions. But with more and more theories, more and more concepts, allowing the arcans to easily explore the world with previous concepts and definitions. It was also constrained accordingly. "Where are you going to start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not conceal: "Of course it is from the inside of the atom that can be observed The sum of the information of the system starts, that is, from the overall state of the system, introduces a state function, and then uses the observable arcane concept as an operator, through which the state function is made and changed, and the corresponding measurement result is obtained. The results must match the experimental results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is silent for a while, seems to be thinking about the meaning of the words of Lucien, and finally very rarely sighed: " Very novel idea, the introduction of the state function of the thermal field into the internal system of the atom, the observable arcane concept as the idea of ​​the operator, I am afraid that only those who love the field of pure mathematics can break out the inspiration, but the cold and complicated mathematical model After all, it is necessary to show its arcane meaning in order to be universally accepted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask more specific content, it was Lucien’s own work. Unless Lucien asks himself: "You have found a new way of thinking, and you should soon be able to construct a theoretical system that hopes to bring good news to my research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what are you studying?" Lucien was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando seriously said: "Two directions, one is an abnormal split experiment, I found that one-half of the quantum number must be introduced to solve this. The quantum number can only be an integer contradiction. Second, I have gained something from the past research results. I have some inspiration that there can be no two identical electrons in an atom, that is, their quantum numbers will at least There is a difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three quantum states related to electrons have been discovered so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This seems to be able to initially solve the problem of electronic layout and the problem of electronic exchange in the old alchemy reaction, for Mr. Gaston's research on the synthesis of living matter. Give a certain theoretical guidance." Lucian did not expect the teacher to think of Pauli incompatibility principle so quickly, very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
