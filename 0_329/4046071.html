			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Weekly list first, week pushes third, so I didn’t think of the location, it’s so happy, thank you, continue to ask for referral support ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....................................................................................... .........<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the exchange of music, the other aristocrats behind the box also have room for interjection, unlike when discussing serious matters just now, they can only listen to Sa Bishop Bilder, Grand Duke Ou Olit and Princess Natasha talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I listened to my lovely little niece, and Victor's music was written intermittently for two or three years, waiting to know that after the concert in the Hall of the Holy Spirit, I also went to my brother's manor for three months to finish. It was full of pastoral flavors, reminding me of the oats that are ripe in my hometown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Earl of Hain smiled and told the story behind the creation of this piece of music to Dagong and the princess. My heart was slightly grateful to Felice. The little niece who hated it and didn’t like it, since I started learning music, I finally let myself Music talents are able to exchange music with His Majesty and His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the eldest son of the old count died in the battle against the infidels, his second son and the younger son began to fight for the title, as the second son of the incumbent The Earl of Hein had not yet stimulated the blood, and Felice’s father was deeply loved by the old count, so he took the upper hand and became the source of the nightmare of Earl of Hein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, Earl of Hain succeeded in inspiring blood power without being optimistic about everyone, and his son Harrington showed it. Not inferior to the talents of Princess Natasha and Earl Verdi, which succeeded in inheriting the title and the hereditary territory of the Haien family in a whole county. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wuolrit’s Grand Duke gently said: “It also reminds me of the harvest festival when I was young. Natasha, regardless of whether his feelings support I have a theme, but as I heard it, Victor's music is already very good. I really look forward to his next two works. In order, one should be better than one."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the last piece was not by Victor, but by his student Lucien. It’s hard to imagine a beginner who has been studying music for three months. What a good piece of music comes.” Count Lafayette also joined the discussion. His appearance seems to be only about thirty years old. The whole person is like a twilight angel in the legend, beautiful and dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Natasha smiled without an image: "Uncle Hart, you are the least qualified person to say this, you can be excited when you are ten years old." The Sun's blood is a warlock's person, but it is much better than Lucien's talent, and you are already a high-ranking warlock of the Eight Rings at the age of 67. According to the normal life expectancy of two hundred years, you are fully qualified to shock. The legendary field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young Lafayette count turned out to be a powerful caster, but the aristocrats would be different from the magician. The blood power cast is called a warlock, and the blood vessels that are different from other nobles are prone to change and stimulate different powers. The Lafati family requires blood purification, so they can only marry within the family, although there are many deformed members. But it also guarantees the inheritance of powerful forces from generation to generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildi replaced Lafayti seriously: "This is the power given by the Lord. Uncle Hart can become a warlock when he is ten years old. That is the love of the Lord." And gifts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that music is also." Natasha smiled carelessly. "Remember, I am looking forward to it, not piped by Sean. Whether the music is good or bad is a very interesting thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafati shook his head: "Victor arranged it at the end, the most important The location to perform proves the excellence of this work, I don't think Victor wants to ruin his concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His judgment got the Earl of Hein, etc. The support of the nobility, without knowing Lucien, they did not have much prejudice against Lucien, although he was surprised at the time he spent studying music, but did not affect their judgment from Victor's arrangement to judge the quality of the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to maintain status and continue to pass on the family, the aristocrats may have many other shortcomings, but they may not be blinded by emotions, they are not silly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdi sat in the chair like riding on a horseback, and his back was straight and there was no relaxation: "Is it? I don't know how the tone and sound quality are compared to the harpsichord?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the second work was applauded by Dagong, Victor completely relaxed and returned to the background. At rest, he can still laugh with Lu Xien, Lott and others, while Rhein maintains a low-key from the beginning and has been standing silently, but Felice and others believe that Rhine will prepare for the next work. Did not care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The break time passed quickly, Victor walked to the piano, he would play the piano himself, and Rhein as the chief coordinated the conductor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Liang, the thick piano sounds came to the prelude of the music, the sacred and solemn atmosphere was put up after a few melody, this is a religion The theme of the concerto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good instrument." After listening to the tone, Verdi sat up with satisfaction, then closed his eyes and listened carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad, solemn religious music features are fully expressed in the broad range of the piano, especially in the high-pitched areas, the volume and control of the piano is perfect, the whole The hall became solemn and sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of this concerto, Bishop Sald painted the cross on his chest: "This is a compliment to the Lord, this new instrument makes this work It completely exceeds its original level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha used to write the cross and couldn’t help but scream loudly: "This instrument is awesome." It is the keyboard instrument that I really want in my mind! The harpsichord and the harpsichord are like the toys of the girls. It doesn't have such a magnificent feeling!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also a girl, Natasha." Dagong originally wanted to praise and applaud, but after hearing Natasha's words, she couldn't help but frown and reminded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of his father, Natasha did not dare to talk back and muttered: "Then I am also the most special one in the girl, I can compete with men, I like Intense, powerful music and battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verdi showed a meaningful smile and looked at Natasha, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allowed Natasha to sit up straight, a beautiful and slightly strong face with a pair of bright purple eyes staring at Verdi seriously: Can't look down on me? Need to go out and play one game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say anything." Verdi's smile on his face doesn't think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the two are not willing to arbitrarily arguing, Grand Daw O'Reum has to use other topics to divert their attention: "The next step is that you are expecting A long symphony of fate, Natasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha looked at the following musicians in the rest, squinting at Verdi: "Dear Cousin, how good do you think this work can be? I think it should be better than all your works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear cousin, I remember You only have great performances and music reviews, and never wrote a great piece of music. No matter how embarrassing you are, in music talent and creation, I am far better than you, but I am a musician. No interest, or else create a record of music in three months..." Verdi is very happy to fight against his cousin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha pretends to be surprised: "Really? Is this really true? Dear cousin, how do I feel that you can’t compare with just learning?" Music for three months, Lucien, your works have not been played in the Hall of the Holy Grail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just I don't want to..." Verdi, who was in the painful position, said with a bit of a grin, "And the guy who only studied music for three months, even if he can write a good piece of music, I don't think it can be better than my work." He was provoked to say I have my own true opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the words are finished, Verdi is secretly annoyed: "Oops, the trap of Natatha, this guy is really a woman in stingy!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine, etc. As long as Lucien’s music is excellent, Natasha will use his own words to ridicule and attack himself, and if Lucien’s The music is only near the level line, Natasha will not have any loss, because this is not what she wrote, Lucian's music is played in the hall of the Holy Ghost and it is not true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
