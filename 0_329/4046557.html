			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille has always disagreed with Natasha and Lucian’s reaction to test Thrad, thinking that it’s too urgent, how to wait for Natasha Almost with a group of loyal aristocratic support, it is possible to do this kind of accidentally irritating the church, but basically Natasha’s decision, she will not object, or try to cover up the established relationship for them. Mark of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, her serious and rigid face is slightly strange: "Glorious Cathedral sent a secret letter reminding you to appease the pro-magic parliament to a limited extent. Don't go to Holm Royal Magic Tower too often, lest you disappoint most of the loyal and loyal nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this?" Natasha picks Picking the right eyebrow, this reaction is no problem, but the problem is that it is too neutral, and I can't see Sarder's mind at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also feels that Lucien’s proposal is a little risky, but she also understands that she does not cross a little line, and the situation around her can’t be changed. In the case of the parliament and the church, all nobles will choose to wait and see, rather than blindly attaching. The current situation is like a pool of stagnant water. If you don't let it move, it will be difficult to get the desired close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille still maintains a slightly strange expression: "And, encourage you to fight against Wayne? Evans, no matter what method, is it temptation or warmth, As long as you can let Lucien Evans defect from the Magic Council, join the referee, and become the high-level watchman, that is the greatest credit, and the church will give you full support and reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A quasi-big arcian, a genius magician who is regarded as the future of the Magic Council, if it really has a relationship with a devout believer, such encouragement seems to be like the response the church should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reaction is a bit strange." Natasha squats back and forth, do not understand what Sarder really means, he really believes in his piety. I think that you can tempted Lucien by feeling, or just find an excuse to cover up things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The old fox's mind is really hard to guess..." Natasha raised her left hand and touched the communication earrings, trying to discuss with Lucien, but immediately thought of it. Lucien should have returned to Allinge, so he forcibly stopped, lest he exposed the purpose of temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, powerful fingers slid along the earrings, accidentally touching the earlobe, Natasha suddenly remembered Lucien’s love for “it”, and the mouth was suddenly A smile came up and the waves softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille turned to look out the window, it seems that she couldn’t bear to look directly at this happy expression, and after a few seconds, Natasha came back, she only Continue to say: "Salde's reaction is a bit problematic, but it is still reasonable, but I do not recommend that you continue to test this way, be careful to play with fire, this kind of temptation must be cautious and cautious, and sometimes prefer to wait for change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aunt Camille, I understand that the most important thing at the moment is to upgrade your strength and strive to control the sword of truth as soon as possible." Natasha did not do it because of her joy. A radical judgment, said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Camille closed the palace gate, Natasha stood at the desk, picked up the feather pen, took a deep breath and wrote the words:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian, mercy, justice, kindness, heroism..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One word representing the spirit of the knight The pen sheds, and the air flow from the beginning becomes awkward, as if to torture his own heart, his own beliefs, his own path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Natasha’s words became single, leaving only the words “guardian, heroic”, and the brush strokes began to clear, revealing one Implied and firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Natasha will indulge in the long-standing experience, the confusion of this time, the dawn of seeing the mind, and the implied infusion of Lucien. All the thoughts were sorted out, and I slowly found the source of my knight's spirit and belief, the love of the family, the guardianship of the family, the enemy, the conspiracy, and the heroism of the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, this is the Lord in my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha put down the quill, Looking at the full guardianship and heroism, there is a sense of transparency in which the dust of the heart is erased. Although the confusion and embarrassment of the past have not been completely eliminated, she believes that by the passage of time, she will be able to get out of this mud sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, it would not be like this now. If you want to test Thrad, you must first open the patron saint of the core area of ​​Nexus Palace, or with Lucien, using his "The Ring of Congers". "hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activity, Natasha had a long-lost fighting desire, so she took up the pale justice, opened the palace door, and went to the specially reinforced "Knight "Corridor", can't wait to vent their inner joy in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residence of the Duke of Flenborg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a long time, the conservative aristocrats saw Rex coming in and asked to ask: "His Speaker, what is the attitude of the church to last night? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex sat on the sofa, his back straight and slightly frowning: "His Lord Saint-Salt reminded Her Majesty not to go to Holm too often." The Royal Magic Tower, there is a limit to appease the aristocrats of the Pro-Parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just remind?" The white-haired Earl of ElBaradei was very disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex bounced his crimson velvet jacket: "Also encourages Her Majesty to use all means to seduce Lucien to betray the Magic Council."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not to give the sheep to the tiger to eat?" The Duke of York said angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Lucien will soon become an Arcanist, a legendary magician, and enter the highest scrutiny of the Magic Council, even if the magician lives for a long time, Douglas should still occupy the throne of the speaker for many years, but how can it be better to join the night watch than the rebellion. This is not the time of the twilight war of the magician. He will not be able to adapt to the current arcane system, so that Queen Natasha will encourage him to be tempted by his "fallen angels". limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have to wait until the Queen’s Majesty has been fascinated by the radical means? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Rex shook his head: "His Lord St. Sarde is worried that the radical approach in this situation will only make the Queen squat and rebel, and more inclined to the Pro-Parliament The nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of York is a 30-year-old black-haired knight who can’t stand up to the old man’s head and can’t help but stand up, anxious Stepping back and forth: "Can we let the situation develop like this? The tendency of Her Majesty is almost clear, balanced but more biased towards the Magic Council, and many nobles on our side are not determined. They are used to following the royal power and their own lords. It is foreseeable that many nobles will gradually move closer to James, Russell and Haisong, and the strength comparison will be reversed in the next year. We must prepare early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Duke of Duke stared at the Duke of York: "What preparation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of York looked around the five dukes in the room, three marquis, five counts, and concealed the tunnel : "Before the King of the Majesty the Lord At the time of the call, the Lord of the Speaker, how do you do it, we will prepare it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His family is the family of Ketonia, so dare to do this to Rex speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex’s face changed: “York, I didn’t do anything, just accept the squat of the King’s Majesty, let Holm strengthen, you are Didn't you hear any rumors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Sorenfen coughed and interrupted the Duke of York's answer: "York, do you want the kingdom to split? You Want to make every aristocrat in your territory unwilling to you? Order is the foundation of our aristocracy, otherwise we will have been swallowed by people. Too radical will only go to perdition."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and stopped the speeches of other nobles and continued: "I think the current situation can be tolerated, although due to the existence of Lord Hathaway and Lucien Evans, the Queen Her Majesty is likely to be more biased towards the Magic Council, but her other moves are obviously showing that she will not give up on us, she needs balance, and needs the stability of the kingdom. This is the situation I hope to see, not the ruined Hall. Anyone who tries to destroy the stability and unity of the kingdom, The enemy of our Sorenfun family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is outspoken and has no talking skills between nobles, but this is another epic knight built in the kingdom. On the basis of his father, others can't imitate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of York had been watching Sorenfen leave, and finally he snorted: "Stabilization and unity, he does not seem to listen to the 'voice of mystery' and 'worldly truth'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This phrase with a distinctly strange feeling is spread from these two channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Bastanan looked at the Duke of York eccentrically. If you didn’t listen, how do you know where this phrase originated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed: "As far as I know, the Sorrento family privately joined the magician to open an alchemy workshop, from magic crystal lights, magic radios and The telegraph has a large amount of income, and they have a vast field in the heterogeneous space. The promotion of alchemy materials such as Jinluo Lai has accumulated rich wealth for their families to increase food production."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The implication is that although most of the Sorenfun family’s beliefs are still firm, this “stability and unity” situation is that they “like to see and hear”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of York spread his hand: "So, we have to prepare early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray The Dukes of Dukes and others looked dark and uncertain. Earl ElBaradei said after contemplation: "Maybe we don't need to do it, some people have been reluctant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the streets of Rentat blew the wind and dispel the heat of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changed shape of Lucien and the little boy-like Affris walked on the street, ready to go to the "Redemption Church" in the civilian area of ​​the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wait for me to enter Richard's dream with a dream," Lucien said to Aphrodite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien himself will also have this six-ring magic, but below the legend, Aphrodite is one of the "authorities" in the field of illusion and dreams. It is more insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the information, Lucien found that Richard was a very popular cardinal in Holm Parish. He was a Holm kingdom. The Tate Abbey grew up. It has not left the pastor from the pastor to the eighth grade cardinal. There are many pastors and bishops in the lower and lower levels of the parish. He teaches and brings them up, but because he is too gentle. The interpretation of The Holy Scriptures is different from the church. After that public sermon, it was kicked out of the core circle of Holm Parish, which is very worthy of contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne was planning to let the committee send people to temptation and lobbying, and after confirming his ideas, he recommended Natasha for the final observation, but The information shows that the commission sent a lot of magicians and enlightened aristocrats to persuade him, all of them shamefully failed - the magic parliament is not a closed conservative circle, it is impossible to wait until Lucien proposed to get in touch with the appeasement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Lucien decided to come to see Richard personally and have a complete understanding of his thoughts and ideas, and then this kind of thing will be given to The magician who is worthy of faith in the commission will do the work. The most important thing is to improve his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afris took the ice cream made by Lucien, and his tongue stretched out: "No problem, what do you want to do in your dreams?" What can I do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a crystal dragon that is quite annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the "Redemption Church", Lucien and Affris found a corner to hide, and it was casted remotely. Now the church is praying at night. Time, the complete defensive array has not yet been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prayer, Richard returns to his bedroom and just walks out of the hall He suddenly saw a young man in a black trench coat appear in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;眯 blinked, Richard suddenly laughed, white eyebrows shook: "Dream? Who are you, want to lobby me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment: "I want to discuss with you the issue of justification by faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
