			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein’s brain seems to have become a blur, and the scene of the memory is uncontrollably flashing. “When asked about Lucien Evans, it was adorned by professors. "The Melzer Black Forest incident is a professor, but the last benefit is Lucien Evans", "the professor who came to the door in the middle of the night", "the cooperation on the 'clown' layout", "the last death The great musician Lucien Evans and other memories are like a grain of scattered pearls, which is a complete necklace by the "Arcane Evans, the member of the Arcane Audit Committee who finally appeared in the hall of the Magic Council." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has more than 80% of his grasp of Lucien? Evans is a knowledgeable "Mr. Professor"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach...Evans..." changed the name, but the voice became smaller and smaller, and Klein closed his mouth tightly because his heart was steep. A strong fear, the Arcane Review Commissioner Lucien? Does Evans want his hidden identity to be exposed? Does he want to see himself and others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the governor of Alto, who has been managing the capital of the Holy Ghost for more than a decade, he has the cautiousness of a professional surname, especially in the face of powerful, high-status objects. Time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Louise’s dream, Pan looked at her: “Do you know Evans?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He, isn't he dead?" "The hanged" Ricardo and "Flame" Zapatero whispered almost simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead? Have they seen the death of Evans Commissioner? Wait a minute, they are from Aalto, but there is a Lucien? Evans passed away, and a grand funeral was held. The Evans committee member said that his hometown is Aalto. Isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan thinks of the chat on the magic steam train, and looks at Lu Xien halfway, is he a talented musician? Every piece of the work is in the Kingdom of Holm, a popular music master in Rentat? Even though "Ode to Joy" is a semi-religious music because of the praise of happy angels, it is not popular in Aringe. But Pan is also very clear. Many magicians like this music quite privately, especially like to sing that beautiful song, the frequency is far. Far better than any of the opera's songs, and Pan is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be almost the same age... How can Pan find indulging in arcane exploration and magic research, and Evans members who are keen on developing alchemy items to make money are not like music talents? An incomparable, piano-playing, near-artistic, elegant musician. Is there anything wrong with this? Will it be Louise who admits the wrong person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakened by the voices of the hanged and others, Louise looked at Lucien with amazement and closed his mouth, just like Sage Klein. The magician who can be mixed in the Aalto magic circle for so many years without being turned into a spy or killed by the church is always cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Louise saw Lucien’s head slightly unbiased, then turned around and showed a gentle and elegant smile to a few people, then Gently nodded, whispered a few words to a few boys and girls, and the pace did not go slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Mr. Evans." Klein first returned to God, respectfully bowed, and the pupil narrowed slightly because he clearly saw Lucien left. With three badges on the chest, six silver stars on a black background, a black ring on the bottom of a silver, and a hand-held feather pen, what it means, he has already listened to Pan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "You have finally come, all the hard work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis When Silk and others jumped, he actually admitted that he was a professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is thanks to the teaching... Mr. Evans, you are pointing our way." Klein was the first to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around: "Only a few of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Louise also stabilized her emotions. The complicated eyes fell on Lucian's face. She was a little scared and said: "There were several dangers on the way. The closer to Stewart, the tighter the blockade. I saw several magics. The apprentice was killed by the night watchman or the priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a lot of people who have not yet arrived at Stewart, they take care of a lot, not like we think we can set off." Klein added that the hanged and the flames are not as familiar as the great musicians like Louise and Klein, and that they have worked with the professors, so they kept silent in this strange place, didn't just plug in, just listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien pointed out that Klein and Louise said: "This is a friend I met in Aalto. They also came to Parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Pointing to Annick: "This is my students Annick, Heidi, Lei Yiya, Sprint, Katrina, who are currently doing things for me at the Atomic Research Institute."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of outsiders, Lucien did not restrain the distinction between real students and occasionally instructed students, let Heidi smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said hello to each other, Heidi was very curious: "Lie Louis, what is the life of Evans in Aalto? Every time I ask him, He smiled and didn't answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louise looked at Lucien, opened his mouth, didn't know what to answer, and the hobby of the female surname made her I noticed the three beautiful unique rings worn by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, Commissioner Evans, are you the big musician of Aalto?" Pan Xinzhong’s curiosity rolled and finally asked, he had I deeply regret the death of a master of music, and regret that there are no more classic works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? The Annick of the Vauritian Principality and Heidi of the Syracuse Kingdom suspected that he had misunderstood Pan. The two Evans, who were most impressed by him, turned out to be one? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big musician is dead, I am now the 'original devil' Lucien Evans." Lucien answered half-jokingly, by the way Ryan's doubts, the ranks of the top-ranking professors in the purification sequence and the real body are completely incomparable. The synthetic urea experiment has also passed for several years, and it is not painful to expose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this confessed? Pan looked at Louise and saw her slightly dagger. Then she was shocked and delighted: "Is it really you? I am your loyal supporter, you are still alive! I don't know if there is a chance to hold a place in Allinge. The concert?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily forgot Luthian's light quantum hypothesis and the odious particle theory supporter.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a chance to say it again..." Lucien didn't have this idea for the time being, neither had the urgency to improve his position in Aalto, nor did he need to cultivate a good-looking girl. What is the significance of holding a concert? ?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Grace, I am looking forward to it. Pan is excited and excited.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am too!" "Annick spoke so loudly for the first time. When studying alone, when Vaolirit repressed, when he encountered a problem and wanted to give up, "Fate" gave him strength!<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reilly, Heidi, and Katrina are slightly blushing. When they are young, listening to beautiful music, there is a talented musician among the elegant princes, Lucien Evan. Even if I just saw the blurred silhouette in the newspaper, the wonderful music can finally give people endless reverie, but now it becomes a teacher, it feels a bit weird and shameful... Fortunately, not in Evans teacher I have talked about similar topics in front of me...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original devil? Is your new code for Mr. Evans? Louise saw Lucien, who was kind and friendly, and did not alienate the expression of indifference. He asked with great courage.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi proudly replied: "Lie's sister, though The code given by the church was deliberately unpleasant, but it did not prevent Evans from being ranked in the 53rd position of the purification sequence! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-three? Klein and Louise feel that they are listening to myths and legends. For more than half a year, they have been trekking on the journey for a long time. I haven't seen the purification sequence. What is the earth-shattering thing that can be done in this position? If you remember correctly, this is almost the scope of the legendary powerhouse!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After debunking their identity, they thought they had already recognized Lucien Evans, but now they find that this young man with a gentle smile is more horrible than his own, and is mysterious!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw more and more magicians slow down and planned to watch, so he smiled and said: "You should go to register first, and have a chance to talk later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, Lucien suddenly felt a move: "Klein, Louise, don't know if you are interested in following me as a part-time job?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
