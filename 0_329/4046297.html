			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenton looked back at the black-pressed crowd, feeling depressed and resentful. Why did those prominent figures and noble priests get invitations without buying tickets? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and looked up at the gorgeous St. Hall, and for the first time felt its luxuriant appearance concealed by the coldness of indifference Ming is a holy shrine but only sings for a few nobles and clergy, and is not open to the vast number of devotees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bitterly shook his head, Greenton whispered inside: "Under the throne of the Lord, the devout lambs are all equal, but some are more equal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Greentown and the disappointing majority of the citizens and businessmen are about to leave the Hall of St., waiting patiently for the songs to be released, a black dragon scale horse from the road The other side is running, and the speed is gradually slowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the knight on horseback screams:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The subjects of the Principality of Vaolirit Our Royal Highness Princess Natasha, the Queen of Violet, feels that music is not divided into classes, regardless of wealth, regardless of the rich and the poor, so she takes resources from her own territorial income to the church, in Mr. Lucien Evans' Returning to the concert's opening of the Diocese of the Plaza Mayor and the Hall of the Holy Land, so that everyone who loves music can hear beautiful music in the music capital!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy crowd slammed quietly, and then burst into a raging cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Princess of the Great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The true God protects His Royal Highness!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Queen of the Princess! Long live the Violet! Long live Vaoli!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Green in the crowd Dun couldn't help but scream a few times, and finally didn't waste his efforts to stay up all night and rush to Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A happy June, a happy "frugality", at least for Aalto people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backstage of the St. John's Hall, has welcomed the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, Princess Natasha, Master Christopher, President Othello, Victor and others Lucien is doing the final preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is surrounded by Franz, student Grace, singer Fabri and a familiar musician - Lucien Pick The orchestra that has worked together, but the chief is no longer Rheinland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a little further away, there are other musicians and choir children and singers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, I think I can already imagine the splendour of the last d minor symphony, I can't wait to get on the stage and praise the true God! This is the best and most trembling piece I have ever heard. I am afraid that I will not be able to leave tears in such a sacred and solemn music atmosphere." Fabrini sings like a song, he wears a formal black Tuxedo, with a red bow tie, red lips like a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few trainings, Fabriini has fully felt this being Lucien? Evans named the charm of the t minor symphony of "Ode to Joy", so if he is full of emotions, he will praise a few words as long as he finds an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gregs, who couldn’t listen to the practice, looked curiously to Lucien: "Teacher, this symphony really has Mr. Fabrini. So good? Can you beat "Fate"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although in different moods, there are different judgments for different concerts, but I think it must be an excellent work." Lucien is as gentle as laughing at others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fronts sighed with a sigh of relief: "In fact, I have been worried that Mr. Evans’s e-minor symphony in front of you will be musicians and critics. They slammed. Although I personally like this piece very much, especially the melody at the beginning of the second movement, its structure is too free, completely beyond the current form, it is difficult to get a consistent identity, but there is "joy "This symphony is the finale, and everything is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also admired for "Ode to Joy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, compared to many works in the late stage of romanticism, Dvorak's ninth symphony in e minor "from the New World" (currently renamed "self-new country" by Lucien) is not a free structure, more close to the classical one. The folk style symphony, after all, Dvorak himself is deeply influenced by the classical music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the words of Lucien, Franz nodded thoughtfully and seemed to be reflecting on the problems related to his structure in his past creations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cellist Thomas echoed: "The New Country is a very very beautiful symphony, even if it is criticized by musicians, it will be Everyone who knows how to listen to music appreciates that time will make it shine in no way inferior to other outstanding symphonies. All of this comes from Mr. Evans's style of not sticking to structure and brave change, plus the last I am going to express my respect to Mr. Evans first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sincere, sincere, believe this time The concert will be an unprecedented success, and every piece of work will go down in history, so that the participating players will get more praise and money – after several concerts by Victor and Lucien in the Hall of the Holy Grail, They have been hailed as the best orchestra outside the court band. Although expensive, the nobility and the big businessmen are still rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "Thank you for your praise and praise, but everything will have to wait until the end of the concert to have a public opinion. Well, time is up, we should Departed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien added with emotion: "In the next four hours, let us forget everything and live for music! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish!" All the musicians and choir members said aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sorted out the bow tie and picked up the baton to get up, but he didn’t stand up straight, and the whole person suddenly weakened and weakened, and coughed fiercely. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher? Teacher?!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The voice of nervous worry sounded in the background, and Lucien gasped a few breaths and waved his hand: "I am fine, just a little uncomfortable. It will be restored soon. The members of the band will go out and prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, are you really okay?" Cellist Thomas, the rough man's beard At this time, the man did not leave the band with the band, but he was careful again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out a bottle of pink medicine from his arms and looked up, his face gradually turned from pale to ruddy: "Thomas, look, I have a potion. It’s hard to beat me, and there’s no problem with the concert.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Lucien’s face recovering, speaking smoothly and not weak Feeling, Thomas was relieved and asked the band members to go outside to prepare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Thomas left, Fabriini asked with a bit of confusion and concern: "Mr. Evans, you drink as if it were not a simple therapeutic agent. Real Therapeutic agents can't be so fast, especially on the disease." He is the lead singer of the church choir, and his knowledge in this area is much better than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to have restored all his strength, mentally tidying up the clothes that had just been messed up because of the fall, and then calmly watching Fabrini laugh. "There is a little other thing that allows me to spend four hours. Rest assured, I will take a rest after the concert and nurse my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien picked up the baton and gracefully walked out of the backstage, leaving only Franz, Grace and the choir members such as Fabrini, who were not able to play on them, a tall but unusually tall back. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fabrini hasn’t spoken for a long time, Lucien? Evans's gentle and firm and firm smile seemed to have always come to my attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the Plaza Mayor, when Lucien walked to the central stage of the St. John's Hall, a little sparse applause appeared, and then it became more and more enthusiastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not listen to Xien, everyone is expressing their joy and cheers - half of them are welcome to the talented musicians, half I am grateful for the kindness and generosity of His Royal Highness Princess Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
