			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame zone in the southwest corner of Aringe, a villa with bright and beautiful gardens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two maids placed white glazed porcelain blue and white tea cups on the sofa and sat in front of the elves. Even if they were strictly trained, they couldn’t help but sneak up on this. The two elves glanced at each other because they were so beautiful, and the two long ears moved and had a strange charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentices who studied the magical structure of the living room at the dining table in the far side of the living room, sighing and sighing, while pretending to inadvertently Peeking at the two elves who talked with Mr. Evans, although in Aringe, in Rantat, from time to time can encounter intelligent creatures of other races such as elves, dwarves, giants, etc., but the beautiful elves with such noble and natural temperament It was the first time I saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this, Mr. Evans, don't you know what you think?" Ellerstin described the alchemy workshop's findings in a slightly exaggerated way. At the same time, I looked at Lucien with a little expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are a member of the Elf King Court, they are leaving the Stroop Forest for the second time, and last time there was the great elder Mafari Ou led the collar. When it was my turn, I wanted to discuss the destruction of nature in the alchemy workshop with the Magic Council, but I couldn’t think of who to look for. So I came to visit the more familiar Lucian, hoping to use his Holm Crown Award winner, The influence of the submitters of the alchemy material papers achieves their purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion also sincerely looks at Lucien: "Mr. Evans, after nearly three weeks of getting along, I believe that you are a caring Natural good people, just because of different races, stand on the human side with their own names. And this thing, I think you understand that if nature is destroyed too much, those who are white and floating on the creek The fish school is the end of your future for mankind. You are not a short-sighted arcane master. I hope that you can exert your influence and let the magic council stop similar alchemy workshops, and all races have a clean and beautiful nature." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the white glazed porcelain blue and white teacup and sighed slowly. "First of all, I want to show that similar alchemy workshops cannot stop. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" Ellerstin and Exeter are disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After gestures to calm the two elves, Lucien continued: "Without the help of these alchemy substances, most humans may even have to fill their stomachs." No, even if they are retaliated by nature, they may have died because of poverty before the consequences appear. So we can't stop these alchemy workshops and stop the pace of human development. And humans develop, for the need for wealth. The legendary magician is a great advantage. I must adhere to this basic principle whether standing in the position of a human or a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, we We must also face up to the problem. The destruction of nature will eventually be fed back to us. It is just that we cannot expand the problem. We must not close all the alchemy workshops because of this sequela. The discussion must be limited to the problem itself. Since these alchemists When the workshop is destroying nature, then we design and add new magic array treatments to decompose the pollutants they produce, so that their damage to nature can be reduced to natural recovery. Within the range, like other biological activities. "Lucien again to stop the opening Earl Aguilera and 埃克西里昂, they have some anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, it’s much easier to deal with pollutants in the magic world than the Earth, whether it’s the legendary magic “elemental decomposition” or the seven-ring magic “element vortex”, The three rings have unique magical "elemental order", as long as they are arranged in a constant magical array, they can perfectly achieve the purpose of eliminating pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "elemental decomposition" and "elemental order" magic array can also recover pure elements as experimental materials, after all, this generalized alchemy substance can be popularized in Decomposition difficulty is definitely far less than magic items, but the problem is cost. It is that Lu Xien does not want to expose his own unique magic now. He must redesign a four-ring or five-ring magic array in combination with the elemental vortex and elemental order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin heard the passage behind Lucien, and the anger gradually subsided, revealing a gratifying smile: "Mr. Evans, you really have Noble character. Just because we have witnessed the alchemy workshop, we are really disappointed and angry. Therefore, the request is too absolute and not realistic. As long as you can increase the magical array and avoid the destruction of nature, I think the future Elf Wang Ting and De The Roy Presbyterian Church is still willing to cooperate more with the Magic Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Princess Royal Highness, things are not so simple. In the future, similar alchemy workshops will inevitably increase rapidly. It is impossible for every alchemy workshop to wait until they are established, and then add magical arrays, and most of the alchemy workshops are sure I don't want to listen to my advice and increase my own cost. That kind of damage to nature will not be curbed, so I hope that the Magic Council and the Holm royal family will separately enact laws to incorporate the purification magic array in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien tells his own plans, and he does not want to live in a place that is unfit for living. As for Arthur, it is relatively simple. As long as you give up part of the equity gains, you should be able to do it. The difficulty is to make it a norm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion stood up violently, and the blonde swayed, a little excited: "Mr. Evans, we have not misread you! You are such a good person, It is a good friend of nature, elves and druids! You are much better than ours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, please do not hesitate. I hope to exert your influence. If there is anything we need to cooperate with, we will let the Elf Wang Ting and the Druid Presbyterians exert pressure.” Ellerstin is also more excited, and the feeling of Lucian is increasing again, it is rare to see For non-Druid humans who protect nature so much, Mr. Evans is really a friend worthy of long-term interaction. "If things can succeed, we..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Elstin wants to promise, but it seems to be significant, can not be the master, so did not finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put down the teacup and picked up his black top hat: "We will visit the committee members."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three major committees of the Magic Council's highest appraisal group: the Arcane Review Committee is responsible for paper review, magic assessment, point rewards, journal qualifications, etc., is the authority of the Arcane, by 52 The composition of the committee members is the most respected one among the three major committees, and the most noble and leisurely position in their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Research Council is responsible for the approval of arcane and magic research projects, and sometimes publishes its own tasks, setting up a research team dedicated to a certain magical direction, managing the council. Magic laboratories, libraries, etc., because there are fewer things and there are special subordinate departments dealing with chores, so only 23 members are good at studying high-level arcans who do not like adventure and fighting. Some members also Member of the Arcane Audit Committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission is responsible for the management of magic apprentices and magicians, internal punishment, external combat, intelligence gathering, magical parliamentary rulemaking, mission area, redemption area Most of the things, which are equivalent to the highest-rated jury, are the most privileged committees, except that each right corresponds to a department, such as the apprentice assessment department, the magician management department, the war mage department, the correction department, etc. There are not many that can be raised to the committee, so the number of members is also relatively small, only 42, most of them are high-level magicians who are extremely good at combat or unusual affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three committees account for three-fifths of the top six organizations, and the rest are either small organizations or thorough parliaments. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the thirteenth floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, Lucien and Ellerstin, Exeter, have just been guarded by the lift The fine gold golem here is stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It uses the voice of the low-pitched Qianlong: "Three guests, what do you have to go to the committee, which member of the committee should you visit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower belongs to the Arcane Review Committee, the 11th floor belongs to the Magic Research Council, and the 12th, 13th and 14th floors belong to A committee that handles a wide variety of matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, we want to visit Ms. Florencia." This is one of the two members of Lucian’s barely recognized, and the other It was Rogerio who met in Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It belongs to the pale hand, no matter how Wayne will not go to him, he is not very rare to expose his identity as a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Florence is not there, Lucien can only find the other three committee members who belong to the elemental will and the Holm Royal Defence Court because of themselves The influence is basically limited to the will of the element. Even if the magicians of other organizations and factions believe in their potential, they may not pay much attention to their own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
