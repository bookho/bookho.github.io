			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Lucien was a little surprised by this sudden arrangement, he didn't have the content to prepare to speak, and so on. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien was originally prepared to give a speech to convince the committee members, but in two days, Florentha has not mentioned this matter, which makes Lucy I thought that there would be no similar things, and I would be slack and forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin and Exeter are very uplifting and screaming: "We must fully explain the concept of our Druid's natural balance. Let the magicians agree and accept!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short excitement made the two elves without any pressure, and they heard that Lucien’s head was sore At this time, the speech should be simple and powerful, and you have to say that there is no effect. What should I say? There will be no enough content to convince people for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of self-intrusion in pollution treatment lies mainly in the choice of a long-term person to live in their own environment. It is a matter of rational surname, and there is no pain in the skin for the time being. To the love of the text, the feelings are sincere, crying and screaming, thus touching people, hey, look at the soul library has any useful information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the Golden Golem, Lucien, Ellerstin and Exeter came to the side door of the Chamber of the Panel, and then sat Waiting for the call inside on a soft bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick and ticking, the clock on the wall opposite the corridor made a mechanical monotonous sound, and Ellerstin, who was so excited that it faded, suddenly became nervous and looked at Lucien: "Mr. Evans, what should I say?" This is no more than her experience in hosting the "Sacrifice of the Tree" in the Elf Wangting. It is not done in accordance with the prescribed procedures. It is not familiar. Elf companions, but a magician who is thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s so exciting, Lucien’s belly whispered, and then, with a sigh of joy, to Elsett: “Talk about the consequences of not dealing with pollution, nature. Retaliation, etc. Isn't this what you are good at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak about not dealing with the consequences of pollution, natural revenge..." Ellerstin Repeat, try to calm your emotions. Exeter is a lot more stable. There are many things in the Elf Wang Ting that he is presiding over, and he often interacts with visiting guests on behalf of the royal family. Compared with his younger sister, he has more experience in speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Ellers spent all his time thinking about what he was saying, he whispered, the side door opened, and a four-level arcian The girl with the five-ring magician badge walked out lightly. She looks like she is about twenty years old, and she is full of vigor and vitality. I am afraid that the actual age may not be so young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two distinguished guests, who are advanced to give a speech." Her voice was crisp, but it seemed to be afraid of disturbing the members inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exsilion looked at the sister who was not ready yet, and stood up and said: "Beautiful lady, let me start first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay to call me Rachel, His Royal Highness Prince." The youthful girl smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien heard the name and looked up at her with a subconscious mind. She saw that she was ordinary, her hair and eyes were plain linen, but she was distributed under her body. A kind of vitality, vitality, and upward temperament, let people feel at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel is a genius, force field, illusion magic genius similar to Larry, Timothy, and Ulysses. It belongs to the tower and is about 20 years old. She had little difference with Felipe, but it has now been opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction of Lucien’s gaze, Rachel’s gaze tweeted, responded with a smile, then walked in with Ekhilion and gently Close the side door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, Exeter was sent out by Rachel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, how is the effect of the speech?" Ellerd asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion shook his head in a dignified manner: "They just listened to my speech, didn't make any statement, and then asked me to come out." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellerd's rug is a simple, easy-to-crawl emerald druid robes that try to make you look calm and trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes, Ellerd was frustrated with a beautiful face, and she cried out like Essilion: " I spoke of 'speaking about the consequences of not dealing with pollution, natural revenge', and the original conscious book of the words taught by Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just I’ve been licking this in my mouth... Later?” Exxon distracted her sister’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellestin licked his lips: "Later Florence finally calmed me with a smile, and I can tell the whole story, but they I didn’t express my opinion. I didn’t hear any argument until I left. It seems that some people objected.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at the information in the soul library. While comforting the two elves at the same time: "You have done your best..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what the result will be..." Ellerstin Some worriedly looked at the closed side door. "If it is not ideal, the joint relationship with the Magic Council will become alienated... But no matter what, Mr. Evans is your friend."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quiet repression, time flies, I don’t know how long it takes, the side door makes a small sound again, Rachel smiles warmly and enthusiastically: "Evans, you should speak."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is wearing a white shirt and a black night dress today. Gold-rimmed glasses, very formal, after listening to Rachel's words, smiled nodded, got up and put down the bow tie, cuffs, etc., followed her into the side door, behind the side door is a narrow and quiet aisle, Rachel took Polite smile, lead the way without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten steps, a turn, Lucien saw the commissioners sitting around a large round table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are wearing magical robes, some wearing different types of dresses, sitting sparsely, less than the number of people envisioned by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Panel, apart from Florence, there must be a variety of outings, such as Rogerio a few years ago, so Allinge only had half of the members of the committee in the early years, but today he broke through the lower limit and only 19 members were present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as long as two-thirds of the members present agree, the rules will be passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Rachel took a seat opposite all the committee members, Lucien saw the gentle smile of Florence, she raised her right hand and did A gesture of depression, let Lu Xien not be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien coughed and cleared his throat, and then hurriedly said: "Good ladies, gentlemen, good morning." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think most of the members have their own blood descendants, have their own friends and younger generations? They breathe the air, drinking fresh water, from the ocean, the forest and The mountains are getting resources for themselves to develop. This is the basis for their survival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and the two elves start differently, let the committee members Slightly concentrated attention, Rogerio looked at him with a smile, not knowing what was in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we unscrupulously destroy nature to develop, then they will..." Lucien still depicted the worst future in accordance with the predictions of astrologers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien tried to keep himself from laughing on the floor and said: "Our development must meet our needs as a priority, and this is beyond doubt. However, we cannot presuppose the ability to damage the development needs of future generations. I believe that our development should be a sustainable development, which not only meets our requirements for increasing wealth and developing magic, but also does not undermine the close relationship with future generations. The environment is within the scope of its natural recovery, enabling future generations to develop sustainably."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lu Xien’s book from a certain government Copyed... "Sustainable development, a good concept. Evans, you go out first, we will tell you the result after discussing the vote." Florensa smiled with a warm and joking smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little flame ignited inside Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Outside the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans, how are you speaking?" Ellerd asked a little eagerly and curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien probably repeated it again, and finally said gently: "Can you impress the committee members, I don't know, I can only wait for the results."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien, Ellerstin, and Exeter sit quietly on the bench outside, ticking the pointer and beating as if disturbing the noise . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this very annoying and depressing atmosphere, half an hour seems to be very slow, just when Exxion couldn’t help but want to stand up and walk around. The side door slowly opened, and Florensa, wearing a formal light purple cake skirt, came out with a six-star arcane badge and an eight-ring magic badge on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince Eksilion, Princess Elstin, Evans, the voting results came out, the first round with ten votes against, seven votes in favor, two The abstention denied the proposal, but at the same time it also proposed the direction of the proposal. Therefore, the second round passed the new proposal with 16 votes in favor and three votes against. This rule is not as harsh as you think, for the violation of pollutants. The alchemy workshops are not subject to serious penalties. The main way to supervise them is to provide them with subsidies and more favorable separation elements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa seriously Looking at the two elves, the main reason for the vote to pass the revised proposal was to form a stronger alliance with the elves and the druids. Every magician understands that if the parliament is defeated, they will not have a good life now. The magician who is hiding across the stormy strait and hiding in the dark mountains is a negative example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eksilion and Ellerd have been disappointed, hopeful, disappointed, and hopeful, and are still satisfied with this result, at least with clear Regulations and concessions, their right index finger points to the forehead, with the unique etiquette of the Elf family: "We feel the sincerity of the Magic Council, I hope that in the future, as the alchemy workshop increases and the magicians understand the environment, they will be able to This regulation is strict. This matter, we immediately report to Wang Ting and the Presbyterian Church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the two elves to the outside hall, Flo Lunsha stunned Lu Xien and smiled: "How? Ivans, are you a little sorry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being barely achieve the goal." Lucien It is indeed a bit regrettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa with his hands behind his back, his green eyes staring at Lucien, his voice said leisurely: "Because your influence and strength are not enough. You have the influence of most of the magicians who admire and admire, and they have the strength to resist and fear, and everything you say will be implemented. Little boy, this is the most attractive man. The performance, you still have a long way to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My husband Oliver is such a man, so although he is a playboy, but I I still love him deeply. Little boy, I hope that you will become such a man in the future, and there will be a girl who loves you deeply." Florensa smiled and waved his hand and returned to the conference room for the next topic. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the side door, Lucien stunned, big arcian? There is indeed a long way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea rolled over, and Elstin and Exeter came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, thank you very much for this event, although the results are not as good as expected, but not bad, your help is crucial The role of you. You are a rare magician with long-term vision and love of nature. When you return to Wang Ting, I will apply for the title of 'Friend of Nature', this is the friendship of the elves.” Exxon first said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Elstin also smiled: "Mr. Evans, don't be discouraged, you can continue to improve the rules in the future. Everything you do, we It’s all in the eyes, it’s so valuable. I’m glad to meet you, my friend, I want to give you the blessing of the elves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take out a leaf that looks ordinary but exudes a strong natural flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not refuse, because this is the main material for the deployment of an important drug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
