			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Serious! Don't be embarrassed! This is the trial court of the ancient hell!" "Lu Sien" sitting in the position of the judge picked up the raft and knocked In front of it, the huge sound of screaming, suppressed the six arrogant devils such as "arrogant" Lucien, a straightforward and selfless appearance. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "hypocrisy" devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pseudo-good" looked at Lucien: "In view of the prosecution of the six parties, I decided to open the trial, please the defendant Lucien Evans Station On the dock, rest assured, I am the most honest and judge of the entire ancient hell, and will give you the most fair and fair trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He As soon as the voice fell, the violent "disgusting" devil stood up and his voice loudly said: "I accuse him of being full of tyrannical revenge, no matter how small, as long as he offends him, he will be killed by him, such as him. Deliberately murdered the 'Golden Corner' of the believers, the night watchman squad from the captain 'clown' to the owner of the team, the innocent object he killed, a hundred pages can not be written!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to expose this kind of appearance and kindness. He always looks at others in his heart. When he is still a poor, he will smash the lives of those gang members, and Natasha loves the West wholeheartedly." Ervia, 嫉妒 Felipe, 嫉妒 pale hand, 嫉妒 all in The magician who has made extraordinary contributions in the field of art! In his body, the soul has been burnt out by the flames of the scorpion. Currently standing here is just a rotten body with his appearance, it is disgusting!" "嫉妒" the devil is not willing Standing backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greed" The devil interjected: "He is also a scum whose heart is ruined by money, treasure, and fame. He signed the paper on his student's paper, and he suppressed it. Those arcane masters who have different opinions from themselves, he wants to insert a foot and refuse to give it to others!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no! Yours The accusations are only appearances, and all this is because of his arrogance. He looks down on all the Arcane divisions of the Magic Council, including Douglas and Fernando. He looks down on all the priests of the Truth, and has not been a member of the Pope and Cardinal. Exceptionally, he looks down on all the intelligent creatures in the world and feels that only he can control the true essence of the world. He feels that only himself is the only beacon that lights up civilization in a dark environment!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In his mind, other intelligent creatures are savage and stupid. Only he is full of wisdom, high above, and soberly watching everything, so he will be cold and indifferent. The life will be full of others' achievements! It's all because of his arrogance!" "Pride" The devil waved his arm, and it was the judge's appearance. He did not put the "hypocritical" devil at all. In the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "deliberate" and "painful" two devils also want to join this noisy accusation, seeing the "hypocritical" devil again raised the raft, has been playing " Lucien, the character of the bystander, suddenly smiled and added a silver-white pocket watch with a strong mechanical beauty to his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick, ticking, ticking, the second hand continually jumps, and as Lucian’s thumb is pressed gently, the slamming sound, the “trial court” violently solidifies. Whether it is gold or dark red, all colors become gray and dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "hypocritical" hibiscus in the hands of the devil keeps pressing down, but how can it not be pressed, and the "arrogant" devil still looks so proudly Hypocrisy and Lucien seem to be a statue in the name of "speech." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other ancient devils have different postures, standing and sitting, arms raised, and right hand forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is like an old oil painting based on gray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not hesitate to prepare to flash into the distance, after all, there are too many ancient devils here, and there is no way to use the "advanced time stop". If there are multiple "luxury big cracks" without dispelling the spell effects on them, Lucien is more confident about the "passive magic" of "self", and the "eternal blaze" and other large-scale attacks under magic, perhaps One can also "die". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, first teleport to the distance, then use the legendary spells such as "space shackles" to trap them, and then come back with a complete "eternal blaze" How much can be done by then, and get more time for your evacuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of seven ticks are mixed together, seemingly chaotic, and eagerly as if the heartbeat will speed up, faster and faster, until the explosion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This... While hearing the sound, Lucien sees the "negative goodness," "arrogance," and "greed" and other seven ancient devils. "Own", the arms are lit up with a layer of silver radiance, like a dream, like the cold moonlight at night! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devils such as "hypocrisy" and "arrogance" have a sneer smile on their lips. It seems to be saying that they used to lie to you! We can also simulate the ability of your legendary items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Advanced Time Stop" effect, "hypocrisy" extends its right hand unaffectedly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Luxury big crack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before "arrogance", "greed", "disgust" and your battle, just to make you careless, let you think There are months and months in hand, don't worry about retreating and escaping. You can continue to explore with confidence and boldness until you come here and come to our seven places that can appear at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the "arrogant" devil sneered at Lucian and read the curse of the sly:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storage Enchantment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? Did you hold a similar idea before? Think that the strength and simulation ability of our ancient devils are just like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the arrogance hidden in your heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not arrogant, you will never fall into the current situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abomination" The devil launched his right hand, his expression was very excited, as if he had seen Lucien ruin in his own hands, so that his hatred was bursting:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yang Electronic Cannon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the devil! The devil known for its fraud, the ancient devil who is famous for playing with people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, cry, mourn, then go to hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嫉妒" The devil's expression gloomyly looks at the devils such as "hypocrisy" and "arrogance" and whispers: <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blazing yang!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go to die together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, "greed" the devil's "soul hit", "indulgence" the devil's "time and space scepter", "painful" devil's "ice goddess Forgiveness has also been shown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change is beyond the expectation of Lucien, slightly stunned to face the most powerful seven attack and limit legendary spells Suddenly I realized the "mood" of the legendary strongman who fought with himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these seven legendary magics, no legendary peak can resist unless you avoid it in advance, Lucien himself can't! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that "arrogance," "greed," and "disgusting" before can't simulate extraordinary items is actually an illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they simulate it? How is it possible to simulate it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the material basis? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lucien is like a "rebel" who refuses to face up to the facts and faces the failure. He asks a question in his heart and asks how this is possible. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question of Lucien never stays on the surface, the way of thinking from the Arcanist makes him think deeply, and smells something wrong. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to another arcane master, it may take a long time to find out where this is wrong, why, is it your own illusion, and is about to erupt The seven legendary spells will not leave them any time at all, but Lucien is different from them. He is here with a guess. It is to verify that some things come here. Ideas and ideas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
