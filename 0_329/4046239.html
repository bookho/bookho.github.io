			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the half-face, seven complex mysterious silver chairs are arranged in a semi-circular arrangement in the dark, and the five arcane masters sitting on it seem to be tall and overlooking the world. God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of the two empty chairs should sit on the skin and become a dark blue long-eared elder, and he would have forgotten everything around him. Staring at the experimental device that is still circulating. The evaporation of water at high temperatures once and for all, the lightning flashes again and again, the drops of water droplets condense, and the layer of layers like a dreamy red color flashes in his pupil reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet silence for a while, with the wig of the wig of the "master of control" Brooke used to surname the fingers crossed, the sound is calm and slightly excited: "This experiment confirmed The possibility of the birth and development of life naturally opens up a new direction for our research. We imagine it too complicated in this respect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brook you I want to say that in the future, we can artificially synthesize a baby with carbon, gas, etc. in the magic laboratory?" The storm dominated and replied unceremoniously, "I admit the great significance of this experiment and the new direction of its disclosure, but I think this is only the first step. The follow-up mystery must be very complicated and complicated than we think! How does the source of life evolve into the cornerstone of life? How are the basic materials of life necessary for other human beings born naturally? How do cells have live surnames, memory surnames, and genetic surnames? How are the bodies and souls related?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook is used to storm dominates each The wrong chasing and slamming, the hands pressed down and pressed down: "I did not say enough clearly, I mean that in the past we imagined the original environment in which life was born too complicated. In arcane research, simple and Intuition is sometimes very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then have you ever thought about why hydrogen is there? Why is there a volcanic eruption? Why are there oceans and floods? Why are there lightning flashes? What is the world before them? Why is it so deriving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Speaker Douglas retracted his eyes on the experimental setup, Looking around at several other arcanists, "this experimental process is indeed ordinary. The birth of the source of life is more natural than the simplicity that all of us imagine. But the hidden behind ordinary and simple is not the same ordinary. Simple.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of the world, the law of operation can never be said in the heart that the house is in line with common sense, it must appear, it is no reason, I want to ask a few Why "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". Why do thousands ......... "muttered quietly dominate storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei nodded lightly: "The mysterious ocean is vast and vast, we just just built a sailboat into the sea, far from being able to Understand the essence of the world, and must have enough awe of the unknown."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of this, the arcane research is full of charm." Brooke smiled and pushed his glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the dead is a sneer: "Although our exploration of the nature of the world has just deepened, it is already the domain of the gods promoted by the church, the restricted area of ​​God." I really want to see the pope and the cardinals know the expression after the results of this experiment. Hey, they will definitely push on the soul. When we thoroughly study the mystery of the soul or understand the operating principle of the gods, see They can also argue when."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he regretted: "It’s a pity that this experiment takes too long and cannot be shown intuitively and nakedly. In the face of other clergy in the church, the attack on the church will be even greater. If we can solve the mystery of the magic, let the magicians go directly to the outside of the church to perform the magic, you can imagine how spectacular it will be."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Arcanist understands that it is impossible for the other clerics of the church to face the impact of the experimental results after seven days of subconscious curious as the two "experimental materials" With such a horrific shock, most pastors and bishops will certainly subconsciously doubt the true surname and exact surname of the experiment, and then deceive themselves until the church finds a suitable reason to settle the faltering beliefs, thus failing to destroy the church. The blow. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are certainly many clergymen who will plant the seeds of doubt in their hearts because of the inconsistency of the theory before and after, so that their hopes for promotion will be minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominated the sneer: "You can't let the church cover your ears and pretend that things haven't happened! How many pastors and bishops will become dreamy light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Arcanists quickly agreed and began to be ordered by Douglas to the Panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Hathaway turned to look at the soul of the dead: "Don't try to use the 'invading mind' to find out which elements of the elemental willer design. I don't want them to be chased by the church like a mad dog, there is no way to explore the alien space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Invasion Mind" and "Weaving Memory" The effect of the nine-ring magic on the high-level magician is not too good and easy to leave traces, but the soul of the dead is that the most authoritative magician in this area has invaded the brain and soul of an eight-level cardinal and read him. Most of the memory, and falsified some of his small parts, weaving the blasphemy and hatred of the pope, trying to get him to assassinate the pope. It is a pity that this indirectly changed his cognitive concept, which caused the cardinal's belief world to suddenly collapse, unable to control the power of the gods, directly swallowed by the Holy Light, and failed to achieve the intended purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic parliament’s first-hand knowledge of the magical research is a lot from this harvest, so the soul of the dead is ranked higher in the purification sequence than Hathaway, the storm dominates Waiting for the Arcanist, at the eleventh place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which high-level arcane masters of your elemental will not be in the purification sequence, what are you afraid of?" The soul of the dead replied slightly, doubtfully, but he did not want to open his face with Hathaway, so he nodded the default, and then sneered: "The wizard actually integrated the concept of faith into his own cognitive world, although in the magical power Before he disappeared completely, he could not obtain the magical gift, but this fusion still has certain research value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, dark cyan skin, wrinkles climbed over the forehead The Malfurion seems to be awake from the illusion, unable to control the voice and mutter: "Nature will! This is the natural will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the main house hall, the arcane men looked at the sheer bright light and stunned The fascinating and beautiful blood brain is put together, only to think that this scene is matched with the shining and shining shadows that are so bright and cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light illuminates the way forward but the darkness behind the light obscures the mud that comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Timothy was full of doubts and loudly: "Is this not a light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a clergyman who was swallowed up by the Holy Light after the swaying of the Holy Spirit?" Larry, who had heard of several similar incidents but never seen it with his own eyes, questioned by the superiority of standing on the stage. Lavin's face next to him sank and shouted: "Quiet! Sober! The question now is why there are clergy?!" In order to ensure that the "experimental authenticity" the Arcanists did not inform the following High-level magician is ready. Raven's roaring effect was extraordinary, and the arcane masters were all awakened and then looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felipe noticed that the cleric who turned into a light was only one step away from himself, and suddenly understood it, his face was very gloomy: "It is the assassin sent by the church." I want to go with me. The magician who blows his head should be guilty..." The light shook away and the light slowly disappeared. Except for a silver-gray dagger, all the traces of Nikolay were swallowed up. There was no expectation that the jingle was crisp, and the short sword fell on the ground as if it had fallen on the cheese, and it was inserted halfway silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is a replica of the sword of truth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The research price of the boat You"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This artifact of the Holm parish is so famous that it was recognized by many arcans and subconsciously judged the possibility of studying it in the church. It is often played in the mural carvings that preached the Twilight War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at another location where the Holy Light broke out, probably guessing the other’s goal and having his own important surname is far lower than Felipe. The distance of the night watchman will be so far away: "If the church knows that it is my Miller experiment, will I go to the top 50 of the purification sequence? Oh, so that wherever I go, I can’t get rid of the church. Fortunately, the experiment submitter was concealed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner’s Rogerio stood up to take over the scene control of the hall and systematically assigned the magicians. action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
