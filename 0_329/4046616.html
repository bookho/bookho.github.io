			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is one of the two premises of this paper, I named it the equivalent principle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; for the quality of gravity and the quality of the habitual name can be described as equal in the appropriate unit system, Black does not find it difficult to understand and explain, once the Arctician has done this research, and got a more accurate The data, but they all regard the equality of these two qualities as an accidental thing, and did not delve into the deeper meaning behind this coincidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Lucian’s explanation of the experiment and the data, Black heard a little bit of swell, simply took out the white paper and the quill, and placed the magic. The radio's mahogany coffee table is recorded and calculated, and is seriously focused on a student who listens to the master's teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of behavior is more or less happening to most of the arcane masters who listen to the radio. They don’t have such an opportunity in their normal life. The guidance of the regular Arcanist level, and the gravitational mapping of the changes in the sky, made them extra curious and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The generalized relative surname principle is finished, and the next step is to use the geometric tools such as Evans geometry and tensor analysis to complete the deductive construction of the whole system. Complex things, I will probably talk about it, you have a concept..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this passage, Black’s feather pen stopped. Every word that Mr. Evans said can be understood by himself. When you are together, you don’t understand what is going on. There are a lot of circles in your eyes, and there are countless complicated words, symbols, and formulas in your mind. Falling down has no practical meaning, making him dizzy, like entering a dream that can't be clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I always thought that my arcane foundation was very solid, especially the mathematical foundation was good, but now I found out that I have not even entered the door... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is the high-level Arcanists studying this kind of thing every day? But why can I read the half of the Arcane Journal? ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such questions not only appear in Black’s heart, but also echo in the minds of most high-level Arcans, who originally had their own Arcane standards. Have a strong confidence with IQ, but Lucien? The things that came out of Evans’ mouth were so incomprehensible, and more accurately, they could hardly understand themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of conclusions, first conclusions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They screamed wildly and decided Listen to what the essence of gravity is, and then redeem this paper for further study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gao Tali. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Astrologer" Annonis heard the words of Lucien from the magic radio that had not been closed, and the expression became very Dignified with a slight suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nine-level arcane master of the astrology system, the nine-ring master, the theory of gravity has an indescribable important surname for him, if he can grasp the essence of gravity and use it Solve some of the problems in the astrological chart that have been plaguing him for a long time, and he has a lot of confidence to become a real "astrologer"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But before he actually saw the paper and found the phenomenon, he still had the most basic suspicion. If the essence of gravity is solved so well, Lord Douglas will not There will be such a serious confusion and embarrassment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the storm caused by the previous speaker’s conversation is not small, Lucien? At this time, Evans proposed a theoretically supported gravitational essence description with a very strong and stable human heart effect. It is normal to exaggerate a little, but I still faintly look forward to it, Lucien? Evans can really solve the essence of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two basic principles mentioned above, Annonis only listened carefully and mentally, and did not record, but when Lucien started geometric language After the description, he became more and more focused. When he started, he started to float a stack of white paper and a quill in front of him. He kept recording and calculating things constantly, and his face showed a confused expression from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evans Geometry, tensor analysis, etc. The number of difficult texts in the journal Nature, most of the arcane masters did not pay attention, but did not pay attention, but The astrologer is a great mage who is good at the field. He has a certain degree of research and even published several similar papers. Therefore, he is not as incomprehensible as other high-level arcans. But even so, he is difficult. To better understand, this paper is more difficult than he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Anonis was so sensitive that he looked sideways and saw the "Prophet" Lord Bergner didn't know when he came in. He also recorded and calculated with the auxiliary array and the quill, and the expression was equally focused. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to ask, Annonis turned his attention to the content of the circuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the headquarters of the will of the element, Lavin’s mathematical knowledge in this area is not enough, and he can only quickly record the key points of Lucien’s speech. Calculus and understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Necker Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the father arrived, Natasha took him to visit various places, and did not have time to listen to the "Mystery Voice" and "World Reality" channels, and Aringe The lightning flashes and heavy rain over there are far from each other because of the distance. She only pays attention to it. It is considered to be the rainfall phenomenon in some areas. There is not much thought. After all, Xia Wei is very common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the light of "Eternal Blazing Sun" illuminates one side, Natasha notices that it is wrong, and quickly contacted Lucien, after she was unable to connect, she worried Will disturb and influence Lucien to do things, rationally suspended, and contacted Hathaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that Lucien and Allinge had nothing to do, she let out a sigh of relief and turned the magic radio on, wanting to hear what happened to Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that the magic radio is actually the most familiar voice, which makes her really relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complex symbols and formulas are beyond the reach of Natasha, but this does not prevent her from listening to Lucian’s serious and focused remarks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening, she held her cheek in her right hand, a mist in her eyes, and a slight smile on her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sky Radio Station" live room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including Samantha, an arcane master looked at Lucien with innocent and stunned eyes, as if he was talking about the world. A language that does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw their expressions and understood that they were too deep, and quickly took the description of the geometric language and the gravitational field equation in a few words and said the conclusion. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the front we can see that the quality will cause the curvature of time and space, and thus the phenomenon of gravity, its essence is the curved space and time, you can do this A metaphor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the surname network is not accurate enough, but it makes the eyes of Samantha and others brighten, seems to understand what, probably understand The essence of gravity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be like this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, is it still power?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this be confirmed by the phenomenon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement, excitement, and suspicion whispered that the room was filled, and even Helen was asking Fernando. This is an explanation of the essence of gravity from an unprecedented perspective. This seems to be a problem of four-dimensional time and space. It is a phenomenon in which an object moves in a curved space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is completely beyond my imagination..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The model of time and space seems to make it even more People can't understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and other arcane masters listening to the magic radio sigh for this incredible and exquisite explanation, while holding a considerable degree Suspicion, because the time and space in the description of Lucien and the nature of gravity make it difficult to imagine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "Prophet" and "Astrologer" expressions in the tower are faint, which completely subverts all their speculations about the nature of gravity, it seems that even it Is it necessary to make a question mark? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
