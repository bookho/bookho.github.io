			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ventilating holes in the high wall blown into the cool breeze, stirring the room to be dull, staring out to the outside but not seeing a trace of moonlight, the night was dark and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness, Lucien sat on the bed, listening to the sound outside, and filtering the whole plan of action again in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there were no major omissions, Lucien breathed a long, slow but firm underground bed and stuffed his feet into the shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bend the waist, tie the laces, and tidy up the clothes. Lucien is so meticulous that he adjusts his mental state to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight is the escape time chosen by Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the previous conversion of physical failure, the witch will definitely try to speed up the release of the seal in a short time, so the end of this month and the beginning of the next month are the best opportunities. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is also the possibility of self and Adam’s misjudgment – ​​the old witch is not fixed at all these days. The weakest time of the silver moon is to unblock the remains. But for another reason, but locked in the cell, lack of intelligence, no rescue, no help inside, this opportunity must be tried anyway, and then wait, it may not take long to step on Ophelia The footsteps of Ya, like Adam, have been the only experimental material for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-situ activity for a while, after adjusting the physical condition to the best, Lucian slowly walked to the right wall and slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咚咚咚,咚咚咚, after a few consecutive times, the stone brick was taken down by Karina, with a sense of drowsiness and hopeful excitement Road: "Mr. Lucian, what's the matter? Is it going to start tonight?" After the exchange, she and Alva and Brad probably know the time when the old witch went to the underground ruins at the beginning of the month, so these days Has been waiting for Lucine's notice, but Lu Xi'an is delicious and sleepy, as if there is no escape thinking, so that she is secretly anxious and not easy to rush, after all, this thing is led by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are prepared, if I fail here, I will rely on you to help swindle the guards." Lucien is calm and seems to be Said that the moon tonight is really round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Lucien did not disclose his actions to anyone, lest he be betrayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina’s voice can’t be suppressed eight degrees: “Okay, I am waiting for Mr. Lucian’s instructions.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently nod, Lucian turned and walked to the iron gate, raised his right hand and slammed hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang-pong, ping-pong, loud voices reverberate around, the two servants who were outside looked at each other with a puzzled look, then shouted by the red-faced servant : "Bastard kid, what to shoot? Want to be beaten by the whip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, they have never experienced the invasion of foreign enemies and the escape of prisoners, they are not serious The guards’ minds, sitting on the wall and placing the beasts on the fur, sit on the top and sleepy. Anyway, the purpose of staying here is not to guard the guys who are forbidden to live without power, but to ensure that there are people at any time, once the owner is precious. The "experimental material" has physical or mental problems that can be discovered in time. If not, the task of the guard can be handed over to the savvy and bloody knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they were very upset when they were awakened by the sudden and loud sound of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not seem to notice their anger, and replied loudly: "Today's dinner is very unpalatable, I am very hungry now, need to stay up all night! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn bastard, who do you think you are? Are you crazy? Really want to taste the taste of the whip? Go away, don't bother us I heard that I was awakened for such a ridiculous reason. The red-faced servant burst into a series of curses, and I couldn’t wait to rush into the cell and beat Lucien. "You have to remember, you are just a prisoner! Stay up all night? Crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no convergence in the way, and continues to pat the iron gate and wake up nearby prisoners such as Alva. The red-faced servants were both upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicious, arrogant, arrogant words suddenly made the red-faced servant violently thunderous, and both eyes picked up, and screamed angrily: "The clown, waste, I let you see who is not even a dog!" When he lifted the whip, he rushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the tall servant next to him slammed him, angered and puzzled and whispered: "Wait, this and his usual performance." It’s totally different, be careful with problems! And it’s ridiculous to ask for food in the middle of the night, maybe it’s a conspiracy...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You forget what he said on the terrace How did the owner pinch his death when he was pinned to death? He has always been such a arrogant madman, but he usually pretends to be modest and courteous." The red-faced servant can still be elegant after being a prisoner and experimental material. The graceful guy has long been indifferent, but the voice is also very low, so as not to be heard by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he narrowed his eyes and said: "He wears a banned collar and a banned bracelet. Even if there is any conspiracy, I am not afraid, can he still play? I? Besides, if you look outside, the key position of the escape is standing with a flesh-and-blood knight. Even if he slams me, he can't escape the punishment afterwards. I will make him look good! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he became a servant of the Magic Tower, almost no prisoner who has been banned has dared to resist, and he himself has the strength of a high-ranking knight. Coupled with the gentleness of Lucien's performance, it is inevitable that the heart will rise to contempt, and that the official knight only needs to wear a brace bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The tall servant thought about it and agreed to release the hand that was holding the red face. "And he is still a magician, even if there is The knight's rank is also poured by the potion, and the melee ability is definitely poor. I will help you watch, you should teach him well and let him know how to be a child!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red-faced servant carrying a whip and taking out a bunch of keys, the skin smiled and said loudly: "I have just a little food here, I will send it to you as an appetizing night and night, you need to eat later. What, etc. tell me directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, since you want to be a dog, you have to choose a dog that is obedient!" Lucien still has no Scruped and sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-faced servant hates to bite the key into the iron door and twist it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, who heard the key, sneaked to the other side of the iron gate and stood against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-faced servant shoved open the iron gate, and the whip waved out: "Come, try your stay up late!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long whips with countless barbs almost enveloped the entire room and hit the bed directly without any hindrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a slender and powerful right hand suddenly came out from the side, pressed on his face and firmly grasped, then slammed to the iron gate Hit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is a bell echoing, and the red-faced servant's face is full of blood and softly falling down. I didn't expect that I would be stunned so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Lucien was imprisoned for his blood, he still has the strength of a high-ranking knight, and no matter the experience, vision and timing of the battle. Better than him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the huge door-to-door sound, Lucien looked at the red-faced servant, and released his right hand, and the cheetah smashed out and plunged to the tall servant. And the red-faced servant behind him did not accidentally fainted to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking servant who had no combat experience at all had a slow response and was at a loss, until Lucian rushed to the front and remembered the whip on the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But everything is already a lot late, so close, the whip can't work at all, Lucien hits his temple with his right hand and hits He got his head creaking, and the golden stars fluttered in the sky. Then, Lucien pulled his left hand and kicked his right leg, the soft abdomen in the middle of the high servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the tall man had to bend down, and a burst of soreness poured into his throat, making him unable to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien’s right hand squats and squats, hitting the spine of the vest in the tall servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After doing all this, Lucien, without any joyful emotions, quickly turned back and picked up the key to the red face servant, and twisted his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien quickly opened several cells, and Adam, Karina and others rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next?" Carina asked Lucien in excitement and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Lucien answered, Alva quickly said: "We rushed to the terrace, and there was only a flesh-and-blood knight on the road. It can be opened by splitting the action. This kind of unintelligent guy is not difficult to deal with, as long as it is not stupid to fight with them. And the height of the terrace is the best escape route from the height of the ground!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree!" Brad did not say much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karina is slightly frowning, the knights may just fall, they are very dangerous, but think of Adam, the great knight, please take him It should not be a big problem to jump on your own, so I calmed down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam looks like a smile to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head and turned to go deep in the magic tower, leaving a sentence to float back: "Do not take this opportunity to crack the magic tower Between the core and the energy, hold the magic tower in your hands. What do we do to deal with the old witch? Do you want to live in the dark forest forever?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will die!" Alva subconsciously snarled, without the determination to face the old witch, and then he loudly said to Lucien: "There is no unlocking of the banned collar and the banned bracelet, what do you use to crack the magic tower core? Still escape, it is most important to survive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the words, a flesh-and-blood knight slammed and ran out, black figure With a strong momentum, it seems to be aware of the movement here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has the strength of a formal knight, even in the witch’s magic tower, the number is not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Lucian, be careful! Fast, we split it apart, and the lack of intelligence is its biggest flaw!" Carina shouted worriedly Tao, flesh and blood and Lucien almost face each other face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam also sighed: "Man, I followed you to the core of the Magic Tower, but first you have to survive and find a way to unlock the bracelet. Avoid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes them horrified is that Lucien actually rushed to the flesh and blood without escaping! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does he think that he has beaten his flesh and blood with his imprisoned bracelet?" The same idea emerged in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black helmet covers the face of the tall flesh and blood, the knight swings out the axe, with a strong wind to the road to the West, regardless of strength, speed, have reached The standard of the Cavaliers is not the current Lu Xien can resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly sideways, raised his left hand in a blank expression, and his arm blocked the car to the giant axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a click, the giant axe squatted on Lucien’s arm, and after a slight obstruction, he cut off the large arm of Lucien’s left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rushed out, and the majority of the arms with the brace bracelet fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opportunity, Lucien's expression is indifferent, the lips slightly bite will temporarily open the blood of the imprisoned blood, and slammed into the right hand black hand A special position calculated early on the ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating radiance shines, the silvery moonlight illuminates, and the shackles of the shackles are swayed, and the cockroaches are divided into two halves, separated from Lucien’s right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is boiling and rushing, Lucien’s right foot is smashed into a residual image, and the sniper of the giant axe is escaped in the bloody rain falling from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Adam, Karina and others were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
