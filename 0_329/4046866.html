			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The windows in the Natravos Magic Tower have a typical ancient magical empire style, located on the upper side of each layer, narrow and frameless, as if directly Inlaid in the wall, the complicated window sills form a mysterious magic pattern. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the daytime, the sun is not well positioned, the shape is too small, the window sills are blocked, and it is difficult to illuminate the magic tower, making the inside faint and dark forever. Mysterious and terrifying, like the impression of an ancient magician in the minds of ordinary people, a good-looking novel: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the cold moonlight broke the long-lasting dim in the magic tower, on the broken wall, on the remaining floor, in Everyone has sprinkled a piece of silver, pure and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location where the moonlight itself falls is exactly where the "time and shining dragon" Danisos is located, and has already begun to be a few hundred meters long. He is flapping a huge wing, turning the ring of black scales, his mouth open, and the dragon magic that is faster than imagination, but his back near the head has a quiet silver in the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Archaic Time Dragon" Danisos’s dragon language magic was directly interrupted, and the slightly thick neck was raised high, and the mouth was fiercely stunned, as if There is extreme pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his back, where the silvery moonlight condenses, there is a beautiful "girl" with a long blond hair slanted to one side, He Half-squatting, the silver-and-white swords held in both hands were inserted into the back of Danisos, and there was no slight fluctuation in the scarlet eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the place where the silver-white sword was inserted, a piece of colorless and transparent blood sprang out, like the famous fountain landscape on the Lentart Municipal Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blood is scattered on the remaining floor. But there is no sign of mixed with dust, but like mercury, a grain rolls on the ground, not stained with variegated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus’s painful dragonfly contained his struggle to die and his body swayed. All the charcoal-gray scales are swaying, and the annual ring-like black rings are all inflated, and the pieces are opened. The surrounding "time and space" suddenly fell into the ultimate sluggishness, including the "eyes of the Lord", the mayor of the Werewolf Sonic and the "Taiwan Silver Dragon" and other legends, "slow down the action", like performing A drama, and "dream fog", "blood color lightning" and so on also solidified like a gelatinous substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how much Danisus struggles, how can he fight hard, the silver moon shines behind him, and the beautiful figure is still half a mile. There, the hands holding the silver-white sword still did not shake. . It’s just that the black imaginary flames entwined on the long sword are shaking violently. At the same time, the symbols that are complicated to unimaginable and give the simple to the ultimate feeling flow in the black flame, constantly flowing into the “Time and Glorious Dragon”. The body of Nisos! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The God of Silver Moon" Aitna! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dark Lord’s ever-changing color eyes slammed, and he was the legendary peak. It is also the "master" of the half-face. Moreover, they were separated by a distance, so they were not affected by the death of Danisos. They directly felt the indifference of the high and the super-existing things. Even if "Yinyue" Aitna did not look at him, his mind seemed to have A pair of scarlet eyes emerged indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn Dracula, isn’t it saying that “Silver Moon” is near the endless ocean? Doesn't it mean that he is plotting with the "Lord of Hell" to deal with Pope Viking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, why does "Silver Moon" help the eye-devil Lord, the six-armed judge, the Nether Demon and other legendary powers, but there are three blood princes here. It is the power that is truly biased toward Him. Killing the other party will not affect him! Even if He wants to save the werewolf. The reaction doesn't have to be so intense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his grasp of the timing, He seems to have been using this thing all the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gornheim is undoubtedly convinced that the "silver moon" here is the real body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Nissos is directly hit by the "Sword of Origin and End" of "Silver Moon". If he is not dead, he will be half-mutilated. After saving him, how long can he survive the silver moon? Don't let yourself fall into it, you can't run away if you want to run! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, leave now and give up the opportunity to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most devil-like demon, "The Dark Lord" Gonheim naturally has the devil's nature, likes to weigh the pros and cons, as long as there is danger and greater temptation, Will not hesitate to abandon or betray the original collaborators - as for the contract, the oath, with his embarrassment, naturally left a loophole for him to get out of himself, and again, there are not many witnesses who can supervise his contract execution. Even if it is forcibly violated, there is not necessarily any loss. Just as if "Lord of Hell" is a witness, can he dare to enter the "abyss" to find himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless ideas in mind, Gönheim continues to weigh the pros and cons, of course, he also knows that things are urgent, whether it is to escape or save, must be in a very short time Determined,. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, under another narrow window, David, who was stunned by the legendary fighting atmosphere, floated and his hair became silvery. Looked at the "Dark Lord" with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Observer" Rheinland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gernheim sees that David’s face quickly becomes beautiful and glamorous, with two huge black bat wings open behind it, exactly the silver eye. Earl "Rhine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you replace him?" Gwenheim asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave is an important part of his plan, so he has long been "become his own" until he actually killed Natravos Only then did he pay attention to him, but the waste utilization site let him go to ventilate the letter, but who knows, David unwittingly became the "observer" Rheinland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein smile did not speak, his right hand raised slightly, like the beginning of the concert conductor, and with his movement, the narrow window behind him In addition, suddenly a bright moon of the lonely HD was raised, and the light was completely sprinkled on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he is no longer calling for the arrival of the silver moon, but with his own strength to condense a round of his own "Mingyue". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His strength has also been greatly improved... "Dark Lord" sees. There is already a decision in the heart, that is, to break through the Rhine and escape to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the darkness is coming, and the faint light to the undetectable light lingers in it. It created a deep cold like the end of the universe. It is a darkness with almost no temperature, loneliness and lifelessness. It is the purest and most desperate darkness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine right hand waved, "symphony" bursts, "Mingyue" fell from the sky, crashed into the dark, exudes endless silver, full of the horizon . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the "Dark Lord" Gonheim and the Rhine played against each other, Lucien was watching the smug-faced Prince Dracula smiled: "If there is no smell" 'To the atmosphere of the silver moon. How can I rush in?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula’s heart is awkward and hateful, why the ancestors’ breath, they “can’t smell” He is a human magician who can detect it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was angry and his body collapsed. Turned into countless bats. Flying over the road to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats are the size of their heads, their mouths are sharp and bloody, and they look terrible at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows that the bats of Dracula’s incarnation can directly devour energy, so they do not inspire “element blessing”, but gently press the right hand’s “monthly time” meter". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "monthly timepiece" full of mechanical beauty is moving around with ticking, and as Lucine presses, it suddenly stops, and the surrounding colors fade. Gray and white are shrouded in everything. The one bat became a small insect wrapped in amber and solidified in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not follow the normal process of "luxury big cracking", but directly used the "uncertained hand" "revenge gaze", right eye It became clear, showing a ruby-like beauty, and a ray hit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the condensed bat was entangled in a black shadow, violently disintegrating in place, and in the gray and dead time and space, a golden cast of the eclipse of the sun emerged, and each time mark was set in a gemstone. Different symbols, the center is a slender gold plaque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the golden dragonfly turned rapidly on the surface of the corona, and the time of solidification immediately returned to normal. Dracula wore a black tuxedo and draped in the black cloak of the inner infrared. Prominent, and at this time, "vengeance gaze" has already hit him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dracula’s face was white and the deep red eyes contained deep anger, and he was allowed to hit him with “vengeance gaze”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after the "vengeful gaze" just touched his body, there was a faint black fog, and after a moment, the red ray disappeared without a shadow. No trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power to "eliminate the blood"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien couldn’t help but be amazed, even though he had long known that Prince Dracula could deprive and devour someone’s extraordinary ability, and he would not have expected him. Even the "elimination of force" can also be deprived of use. Just breaking the "day stop" of "time stop" may not be an extraordinary item, but a unique ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these deprived abilities will be lower than their own level, but the horror of Prince Dracula can be imagined, no wonder In the ranking of the purification sequence, he has been consistently ranked in the top three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien was not afraid, facing the huge shadow of Prince Dracula’s transformation, and raised his face with a smile:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eternal blaze!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use eternal blaze in this closed environment? Not afraid to kill yourself? On the other hand, the "dark Lord" Gonheim, who tried to escape, was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that Douglas’s ability to display “Eternal Blazing Sun” has the ability to be close to a genie, and Lucien’s current strength is similar to that of Douglas. And "eternal blaze" comes from his legendary career, and is closely related to his cognitive world and half-face. Therefore, his "eternal blaze" power is stronger than Douglas. Maybe there is a real kind of god-strike The ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of dazzling glare to the extreme light burst, like a small sun rising, but the power is much worse than Gonheim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dracula faced this pure sunshine, the majestic sunshine, and made a scream of screams, the shadow disappeared, and a scary face appeared. Blisters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the promotion of the legendary peak, Lucien’s mastery of the “eternal blaze” has reached a very fine level, which can accurately control the power. Very small "fusion", relying on the central ultra-high temperature, particle ray and "the sun" to create lethality, as long as it is not in the middle, and there is no defense, the legendary third-order can also block, but Dracula is different, He is an ancient vampire, this is his most fearful "sunshine"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吼! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danisus made an unwilling roar, the black illusion of flame on the "Sword of Origin and End" has wrapped him whole body, inscribed one after another "symbol". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, "Silver Moon" Aitna pulled out a long sword, and the black flame spurted out. There was also a blazeless flame in the surrounding void, "igniting" The Magic Tower, "igniting" the chaotic jungle, "igniting" the entire half-face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic and abyssal atmosphere disappeared, and a bright moon was revealed in the sky, and Danissos narrowed his body and squatted at Atena’s feet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Dark Lord" took this opportunity to harden a copy of the Rhine and escaped to the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aitna’s scarlet eyes looked at the legendary powerhouses such as the eye-devil master and the six-armed judge who were freed from the solidified time, and declared very seriously: “I It is your speaker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃? All the legendary powerhouses are stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
