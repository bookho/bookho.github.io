			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duda, who experienced the accidental murder and the sudden change of the underground palace, was still immersed in the state of panic and helplessness. At this time, I saw someone quietly coming to my face, suddenly The whole body is stiff, the brain is blank, I don't know what to do, I can only subconsciously follow the boots, look up and look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you..." Seeing standing in front of the well-connected companion Andris, Duada suddenly relaxed and the heart began to beat vigorously, like It is necessary to make up for the loss of a few seconds before the stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andris’s mouth twitched with a bit of inexplicable smile: “It’s me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will tell you that this underground palace is too horrible, and the sentimental array is not working! We are hiding together and waiting for the trial to end." When meeting friends, Duda is telling his inner fear, but He subconsciously did not mention his murder, and he said with a suspicious question, "What about your armor? How to wear it like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duda clearly remembers that when the two of them came to the ancient villa of the gorse family in the morning, Andris was wearing black full-body armor instead of the white shirt and tight trousers. The only thing in the whole body is the same place. The brown-brown new boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andris is still a sly smile, answering the question: "Is it terrible? I feel very good."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and was very intoxicated: "I smelled a good bloody smell and smelled the pain, resentment, hatred and greed accumulated over hundreds of years..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A chill came from Duda's heart. In such an environment, when you hear such a nightmare, normal people will be full of fear: "Andris? What happened to you? You also "Wrong hand killing people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrong hand killing?" Andris's facial muscles suddenly squirmed and squirmed like a mass of flour, and then The hand stretched straight through Duda's armor and inserted into his chest. "Like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duda's expression is distorted, full of despair and panic , watching Andris's face become a dry old man, and become a companion of understanding, and finally changed back to the original appearance, and The right hand has been back out, beating the bloody thing on top of a group, it expands and shrinks, full of vitality of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my heart like this? Duda fell into the eternal darkness, but he thought vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a wonderful painful taste." Andris continued to close his eyes and intoxicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, six pairs of white light wings spread behind Sophia Let her become like the legendary "monarch of the wind", full of sorrow and sorrow, and set off her own appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lucine’s opinion, Sophia’s looks were originally exquisite, but because of age and experience, they lacked a unique temperament, with Natasha. Compared with Selvia and other beautiful women, she still lacks one or two flavors. Now, she is not inferior to anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pointed her wand, and the rope of Prince Bell’s wind increased again, and it became more and more solid, and Denny, who was tied with a ponytail, had a strong face and a sword. The sword was like a lightning bolt, and Bayer was forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of Alten, after receiving two consecutive treatments by Sophia, the injury actually miraculously recovered, it seems that the blood itself is a little strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the black shield and took a few steps, and the right-handed sword swayed the starlight to Bayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he was promoted to the Cavaliers, he dared to face up with Bayer at the top of the fifth level? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer greeted with a faint green sword, blocking the starlight of Alten, and immediately there was a kind of opponent who was so powerful that the whole body was pressed down. A little bit of feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword has a problem? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, behind Bayer, a glorious wing grew out and wrapped him in, blocking the attack of both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric flash thunder, starlight 璀璨, a piece of 璀璨 璀璨 凝 凝 凝 的 的 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 凝 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜 拜Deni and Alten are forced to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as he had to step forward, when he was chasing, the surrounding space suddenly highlighted the distortion of the illusion, and the whole person was pulled to swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twisted magnetic field"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denny and Alten seized the opportunity to stabilize their position and smother again with Bayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distress, Hypnotism, Fear, Sleep, Wind Rope, Twisted Magnetic Field, Magnetic Field Concussion, Spider Web, Auxiliary or Binding Magic by Sophia Casting, she did not try to attack and defend, but very well interfered with Bayer, weakened Bayer, slow Bayer, and the two knights' offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her magical choices are not awkward, and Bayer is gradually at risk. The "wind" element, in the ancient magic system, also symbolizes illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the blood of the "Silver Angel", Bayer’s magic resistance is very high, and most of the magic that Sophia sends can only be slightly disturbed, and he is behind him. The six pairs of light wings "lighted" to vanish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia did not panic, while using magic to stimulate the language:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, you Still thinking about his father's strong secret? Still thinking about why he can break through the imprisonment and become a legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think the secret information is? Who is hiding there? Do you think that a father with such a deep person will record what he has experienced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer’s heart trembled: "Is it you?" Br?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? I mimicked my father’s handwriting very much like it? If there is no such big secret, how can I lie to you into the underground palace? How do you lay a trap around you? Sophia smiled purely, not like a conspiracy planner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "False?" Bayer hopes to fall, and is slowed by Denia's lightning, Alten's starlight, and almost hit them. Next to Claire was besieged by several aristocratic children who had stimulated blood power, and was on the verge of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, really, but this secret belongs only to us, only belongs to me and my knight! Thanks to the legend of Ralph from the gorse family I found this big secret, let me understand the strong source of my father, let me find a good opportunity to deal with you, and Alten they are admiring me, loyal to my knight, willing to give everything for me, so we joined hands This is a 'opera'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia’s smile seems to have a natural charm and swaying, "Well, thanks to the fool of Borak, let You thought that I wanted to help him, control him, and thus the family of the gorse, did not guess my true purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she turned her head Looking at Lucien, I didn't accidentally see a face with no expression, so the pink lips twitched softly and spoiled: "I really like you, no, how can I deceive my brother?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Lucien answered her in response Sentence, the direction of the chamber soon projected out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia giggled: "I know that you are not that simple, and that you don't like me at all, don't fall in love with me, all your fascination is out ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know?" Lucien asked this question sincerely, his acting skills actually went wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia once again used the wind to bind Bayer, and then smiled delicately: "Your enthusiasm only flows on the surface, I can not feel your inner feelings In this respect, women are very sensitive. Hey, if you don’t know that you were a playboy and secretly pursued Jocelyn, I thought you were a little boy who had never experienced emotions. If you want to play the game, you don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
