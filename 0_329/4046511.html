			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep purple "Violet Guardian Armor", all black battle skirt, small and exquisite but deep black and heavy sacred shield, Guanghua introverted pattern plain silver long sword, The well-defined face, the resolutely silver-purple eyes, at this moment, Natasha is not as cheerful and enthusiastic as usual, but the imposing manner, giving a great sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you actually meet her here? She led the Golden Knight of the Vaughan Principality, the Knight of Heaven?" Lucien suppressed the surprise, Half of the joy is half the worry and darkness. Normally, the Southern Church cannot confuse the knights who are called by each country. The nobles are only loyal to their lords, and at most they use high-level clergy to coordinate arrangements. Since Natasha has entered this heterosexual space, it must be the leader of the Knights of the Vaurit and the Golden Knight. How can there be no protection from the strong? How can I leave the team privately? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, there is still a strong protection, Lucian quickly sees Natasha behind him with a shadow almost into the dark, it is a black court The "deep blue tide" of the long skirt Camille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ramiro did not regard Francis as a companion, which means that he is probably a member of the Northern Church, how can Natasha cooperate with him? And that gloomy The tyrannical man seems to be the 18th-ranked 8th-level Knight of the Night Watch, 'The Purifying Fire' Danielle, who is obviously a high-ranking clergyman, and they are not likely to cooperate with Francis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien wondered, Natasha’s brother died in a war with the “Northern heresy”, indirectly causing her mother’s early death, who she worked with. It is obvious that they will not join hands with people from the Northern Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of people hiding the blood, the origin and the real name in the team of night watchers, but most of them are famous, code and name. It was mastered by major organizations, so after the first encounter with Ramiro’s self-destructive attack, Lucien found the identity of the attacker from the information collected by the Soul Library. As for Ramiro’s real name, It didn't matter, and when he saw the gloomy man he had met with the clergy and Natasha, Lucien inferred from the momentum and performance that he was "the fire of purification." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two southern aristocratic knights, a high-ranking vigil, a high-ranking cleric of the Southern Church, a suspected Northern Church' execution "The Knight of Heaven, such a combination is really weird, hey, maybe Sophia is temporarily united with a needle?" Lucien thought of Sophia, who had never appeared, her father Rudolph II was weird, and she obviously would not It is a devout believer, and the identity is very noble, and it is suitable for being a "strategy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield presents a short period of stagnation, and Francis and others seem to be unable to understand the eccentricity of Annathan, and dare not rush, but one-eyed Antana Then he looked around with a sneer smile, and he said, "Let's you guys? Let's go together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater than the head of the warhammer, Surrounded by the bloody and bloody war, there is a warrior riding or riding on the back of Anantans. Their expressions are fanatical, war-torn, horrible, just a second of time, Annatans. It's like getting a knight made up of at least a big knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every strong who is killed by him, every priest and hero of the fallen, the soul will enter his semi-illusive war field, Follow him to continue the endless war until the soul is completely dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar coverage of a few hundred meters of semi-illusive will is the main difference between the Golden Knight and the Knight of Heaven, and the Lord of War, Annathan, is obviously in the direction of the Cavaliers. The pseudo-god of development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill!" Anantans shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Kill!” He didn’t know how many knights’ shouts followed, and they gathered together, the sound was deafening, the war was going straight, and the high-order The clergy can't help but take a step back in the air,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the god of war, I am the Lord of Hosts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a trip, Anantans led the army and rushed toward Natasha. As a hero of the blood that started as a battle, he obviously I feel that she is the weakest among the enemies around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag is inviting, boiling against the sky, a row of rifles like a forest, a sacred magic, plus the front seems to compress the air, shorten the distance The horror warhammer, whether it was Francis, Danielle, or the clergyman and Camille, had the will to be taken away, and the shot was slowed down half a beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pong! Where the black shield collided with the war hammer, there seemed to be a small and horrible black crack. The surrounding space seemed to solidify. The center of the two sides was the center of the cross, and the undulating ripples rushed outward. Forest-like rifles, and the different colors of the sacred brilliance hit the solid "space", can not go any further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s face is tight, her teeth are biting, like a reef in a raging wind, it’s so lonely, it’s so firm, it’s going to rain All in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This woman, don't know how to hide! Only at the seventh level will dare to fight with the gold knight of the 9th level! There are nine levels of 'True Shield' imitation Can't be so messy!" Lucien, who was hiding in the grass, snarled and couldn't wait to drag Natasha back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was promoted to level seven a year ago, the gap with Annathan is still very large, and there is no day knight with no eight. Help stop, look at Sophia, accept the teachings of Rudolf II, this time is not exposed, no matter who wins or loses, will not endanger her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a book of sacred atmosphere in front of the old man in white robes. It quickly flips, the light shines, and the pillars of light that follow the sky are falling from the sky. Central Antans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antanas has a layer of rust-like brilliance that blocks the yang blast, and the soul of the warrior who follows him charges a silent scream Within the scope of the envelope, all of them disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to attack the old man with a hammer, but how can Natasha in front of him let go of this opportunity, the silver-purple eyes are cold and ruthless, and the right-handed sword is cut out. There is a crack in the front that seems to be not in the world. It seems to be able to break everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antanas looked at him, forced himself, changed his direction, avoided the sword, and then the warhammer hit the Natasha in a storm. In the field of war around, the soul warrior condensed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the sky, the thick darkness turned into a blue sea, the tides of the sea surged, hanging down and slamming to Annatans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the ground burned with a silent white flame, as if a sword light rushed to Annatans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Scriptures in front of the old man blew through, and Guanghua continued to light up, constantly adding Natasha to supernatural powers, blessings, wars, gods, etc. Gain class magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only holding the "Replica of Truth Shield", she is entangled in Anantans, and there is a chance of winning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Camille and "Flaming of the Flame" joined the battle group, Natasha got a little gasp, and the left hand holding the black shield slammed open and quickly flicked. After a few moments, and then continue to clench, it seems that Antannas's continuous terrorist attacks have caused her fists and arms to numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis saw the sun god Belo, through the mind-connected oracle: "You help them to entangle Anantans, I help me to attack Killing Ashin, and waiting for him to absorb Asin's secret death and resurrection, the surname of God, to the level of Annatans, the situation is completely under our control."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Blonde, but the vicissitudes of the sun and the god of justice, Bello, gave himself a lot of gaining magic, and then armed with a shield, attacking Anantans with a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The God of Love and Beauty" When Axin came out of the "Lord of War", the beautiful face was filled with surprises from the heart, which can be seen in Anna. After Tans was entangled in the inexplicable enemies, his face quickly changed a few times, and then Els was also trapped by the starlight cage. The dusk-like light illuminates and he must fly away quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not absorbed by El, it is the greatest help!" He thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Want to escape!” has been waiting for his Francis to become a dark-skinned Hydra, with thick black fog covering the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is shining, it is bleak, seeing the front is difficult to break through, not wanting to entangle with Francis, Asin suddenly fell, trying to leave from the Solna River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I command you, shock!" At this time, El was freed from the cage of the starlight, and applied to the law of the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
