Doesn't he know the relationship between Irvine and Coco? This is impossible, Coco and Elvin Smith will pass, this is what the old butler told Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and Coco took his clothes at once. While wearing clothes, Richard looked unintentionally and asked: "You don't hate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted and sneered and said: "I let your lover slap yourself in front of you, but you fainted directly at the time! Don't hate? Go to hell!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa hangs his head and whispers: "No, it is not like that. I was scared because I haven't seen such a bloody scene."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ackmonde people will be afraid of seeing blood?" Richard deliberately bit the name of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa silently, tears will see the drops, but still bite his teeth and shed tears, replied: "The blood of Archimonde on my body is very thin, almost Say no. I know that I shouldn't be on the floating island, but... I can't do anything. And Irvine, he doesn't even have the name of Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaben wants to say, "When you grab something, you can all say that you are an authentic Archimonde." But seeing cocoa is stunned, still did not spit this irony, just Said faintly: "You should be clear, Elvin will die under my hand, but I don't want him to die too early. The later he dies, the more he suffers, the better his family will be." If you want to exchange your freedom for yourself, it is best not to speak, it will only irritate me. If you anger me, the consequences will be very serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The head of the cocoa almost fell to his chest, with a whimper, whispered: "I am not for him, really not! I I thought it was a good impression on him, but... but what happened later is completely beyond my imagination. I never thought that he would do those things. But I have not betrayed you, really not!... at least The body doesn't."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a crush on me?" Richard sneered faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no." Cocoa was silent for a while and finally chose to tell the truth. She knows that she is not very smart, so telling the truth is not the most stupid choice. "I... I hope you can forgive me. I will work hard to do everything you want me to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood in front of the mirror and began to sort out Clothes, while saying: "Please forgive me? No need for this, you have nothing to forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the tone of Richard is more dull, cocoa The more she was afraid, the more she saw that Richard had finished the clothes, she was anxious to pull Richard, pleading: "No, beg you, don't do this! The more you say, the more I am afraid. I know You will leave again soon. Can you tell me what to do before you leave? If you don't tell me, I... I am very scared every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Each sentence of Cocoa is the truth, so that Richard’s heart can not help but be a little volatile. He turned and quietly looked at this little girl like a white flower everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was hesitating, he remembered an old wisdom: "When the people around you tell you the truth, you must encourage them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Licha finally said: "Cocoa, if you want to get my forgiveness, it is very simple and difficult. As long as you do it, let me believe that you really fell in love with me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...good, I will work hard." Cocoa knows that his acting is not good. However, since Richard has made a request, even if it is a difficult to fulfill the request, it has made her a lot of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of the rack, took a copy from the top, handed it to Cocoa and said, "I will help you. The words on this page can make you Know me a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard left, Coco looked at his hand. This is the "Biography of Charles the Great", which tells the story of the life of Charles the Great, the founding emperor of the Holy Alliance. The focus is of course the great emperor's story of the millions of troops marching into the abyss and killing the dragon. These deeds are cocoa and familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opens, flips to the title page, and sees the words printed on the title page is the words that the emperor stepped on the skull of the dragon dragon Dala:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow me, Chang, who is against me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard arrived at the Eternal Dragon Hall, it was less than eight o'clock. When he informed him, there was a beautiful goddess officer welcoming him and introducing Richard into a quiet room in the apse. After a while, the Vatican’s great official came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and succumbed to a ceremony, respectfully said: "Respected big priest, don't know what you are asking me for? As long as I have the ability , I will do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Vatican's great priest, Richard is sincerely respected. She is always plain, looks beautiful, but not stunning. But the light and ethereal taste from the inside out is not imitated by others. As long as she stays by her side, she will naturally be affected by her, and her mood will become bleak and empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s return to Nolande happened to coincide with the danger of the dislocation of Gotton. If it was not for the eternal dragon palace to give him shelter, he was I don't know how to crack the crisis. Relying on the shock of Su Helun, Richard may be able to save his life, but only to leave a life, but can not keep Archimonde's interests in vagrants, and even can not keep the lives of several brothers and sisters. Scribbled roots, this is a must-have common sense for every rich child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of Ferdinand, or Greek and Nolan, the decisions they make must be approved by Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin the great priest sat down gracefully opposite Richard and raised his hand to signal that he was also seated. The voice of the great priest is soft and soft, and the tone is always faint: "Li Cha, I have already seen the sacrifice you sent last time, you can confirm that it is the head of the star beast. Although it is not fully adult, but the value It’s also immeasurable. The image says that if it’s time-honoured, it can bring you more than 50 years of extra life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathing is a little short. An extra life of fifty years! For anyone, this is a temptation to resist! How many big things can you do in 50 years? Even in an incomparably vast main plane, fifty years is enough to lay the foundation for a great empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time means unlimited hope and possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a huge grace, and now it is a very sensitive moment. The whole situation of the floating world can be described as a whole. So, the distribution of this grace is especially important. I don't know what you think. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has long thought about this question, so he replied: "The first choice is of course to obtain the number of the Faro plane and to enhance the plane of the plane. Rank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline applauded and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very sensible choice. When the plane level of the plane is increased, the channel can be made more stable and the capacity is larger. Popularly speaking, the cost of monomer consumption is greatly reduced while being able to deliver more people and items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you spend ten years of time, the cost of the plane channel will drop to the level of a fully armed knight of 30,000 gold coins. The consumption of magic items at the same time will be correspondingly lower. If you spend another decade, you can further reduce it to 20,000 gold coins. This has exceeded the level of the original three planes in the hands of Gordon. Except for the Greenson plane, the Schumpeter family has been operating in Green Forest for a long time, and the plane number is very high. Even if it is an unfixed plane portal, it costs only 10,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Qi Qi plane, it is a completely different case. The Mensa family has been in the original name of Rachel Vichy for hundreds of years, and the established empire has occupied almost half of the plane. On the founding day of the Empire Millennium, the Mensa family made a very high-level sacrifice and changed the name of the plane to Qi Qi. Through hundreds of years of uninterrupted sacrifice, the level of the plane channel has been raised to a very high level... Before the problem with the Qiqi plane, the cost of transmitting a warrior of level 10 or above is only two hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Gordon launched a war against the Qiqi plane, just transmitting the cost of tens of thousands of troops to nearly ten million coins! So he naturally came out of the nest and invested so much in the cost that this battle can only succeed without failing. To know that this military service, most of the military expenses are the pockets of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage means that since she is there, there is no need to worry about warfare, and Gotton just let go! If the territory of the Mensa family can be burned out and robbed, then she will never earn the money spent on this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows that when Su Helun explained the principles of war to Gordon, it was not the cute teeth of the weekdays, but the calmness and clarity. So Gordon understood her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vanine asked again, Richard had no other thoughts. What kind of grace can be obtained at the time of sacrifice, most of which depends on luck, and planning is useless. Only the setting of the plane number, the elevation of the plane level of the plane, is easy to appear as long as needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin Da Shenguan said softly: "Li Cha, my suggestion is that the sacrifice of the sacrifice obtained by the sacrifice is increased in the plane for about 20 years. In addition, I personally have a little hope, I hope that you can distribute some of the grace you get to the quicksand and let her use it. She needs grace now, but even if she presided over this The second sacrifice is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sand is very needed?" Richard confirmed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent, but his heart is ups and downs! Although he does not know how much sands need to do anything, but it is not trivial to let Vatican personally come to him to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
