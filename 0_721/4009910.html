			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil lord above the throne is not moving, a pair of black spar The eyes looked quietly at the generals below, and said in a metal-smooth voice: "Those humans come and go, not just to slaughter me a legion. What information did they leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carcadis takes out a letter, but the letter is written by the finest magic paper, otherwise it has been corroded in the air of hell. . The general sent his hands forward, and a group of dark black energy was sent to the throne in front of the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Intruders are strong, headed by a human female mage, her power is much more than that. She asked me to bring this letter to adults, Said above is some of her suggestions for our preparation to enter the Noland plane," Kakadis said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lord nodded and said, "It is worthwhile to kill a legion and take off one of your arms. Her advice is indeed worthy of acceptance. This woman is called What is the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Hailun, an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Hailun..." The lord whispered the name several times. Unlike other devils, his power is extraordinarily strong, so many ambiguous messages can be obtained from this name alone. Later, he opened the envelope, and there were only two very short characters on the stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lord can see at a glance that the first line should be the detailed coordinates of a point at the Noland plane, master the coordinates, the plane of the plane The accuracy can reach within ten meters. The second line, which is a fragment of magical storage, naturally shows its meaning in his consciousness, but it also makes him somewhat confusing:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lord pondered for a day, and the little lords in the palace waited for a day before asking: "Carcadis, Su Helun also said If you have anything, tell me that you should not miss a word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carcadis tries to think back, the wisdom of the devil's little lord is equal to that of the legendary human being There is no possibility of forgetting. He traced the battle scene back in an instant, and said, "Yes, she said a very strange word: Su Hailun on the left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil lord silently Nodded, the black flame was burning in the palm of my hand, and the letter was burned clean. He let Kakadis go to rest, then he reached out and ordered two demon lords to go out and told him: "This time you enter Noland, you will lead and take the first legion. After entering, be sure to cause With enough damage and plundering the soul as much as possible. Noland's final indulgence is to rely on repeated blows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two small lords are excited Surprise, fell to the ground, accepted the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil on the throne stretched out, and the two black energy floated in front of the little lord, blending into their chests and turning into two crystal black gems. In the most dangerous moments of the battle, the added power of the two gems can bring them back to the palace in an instant. Each small lord is a precious asset, and the soldiers are cannons that can be sacrificed at will. Every once in a while, the devil soldiers become too much and need to rely on war to cut a part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment of contemplation, the lord on the throne said: "After walking out of the portal, the whole team turned to the right and attacked all the way! No matter what is left or opposite, don't take care of it. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two devils felt that the order was strange, they immediately said that they obeyed. The devils are clearly defined, and the order of the lord is not to be violated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, on one level of the endless abyss, the roar of the supreme ruler and the demon lord shook every corner of this abyss, all kinds of The demons are all squatting, afraid to move, lest they provoke the anger of the great lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a burning lava lake, a body-shaped demonic is floating in the air. He has an indescribable power, and the power of overflowing power directly turns into countless mysterious and ancient demon characters, flying around him. On the opposite side of the devil, it is a wave of water blue, floating in the glory of a beautiful little woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Su Hailun! You dare to appear in front of me! Do you think I can't pour my anger to Noland?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage spit out his tongue and smiled and said: "Bei Meng Gauguin, I just know that you are ready to enter Noland, only come over to find you. Don't be so angry. You know that anger is useless. You can't catch up with me anyway. If there is another battle like this, it will hurt your dignity! The other big lords will definitely I’ve talked about it for thousands of years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bermont Gauguin snorted, spewing two long flames out of his nostrils, then cold Coldly said: "What do you do here, are you ready to stop me, or just want to irritate me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am not good at angering you." I came over and wanted to make a deal with you." The legendary Master took care of the messy hair and said calmly: "I can give you a The exact coordinates of the Rand plane, in exchange, after entering Noland, your subordinates must abide by a simple rule. At the same time, I want to get the right to hunt in the abyss of your rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Menggao has some doubts and asks: "What rules?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, go out to the left." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon lord snorted and did not answer, but asked: "What is on the right side of the portal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am on the right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the front?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil's Legion Will appear in the front. They will turn right and attack. You don't want to fight a bloody battle with the devils in Noland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil Lord Nodded and said, "The left side of the portal is your enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary wizard smiled and praised: "Sure enough, the big lord is smart. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bai Menggao moved his body and immediately caused the boiling wave of the lava lake below. His thunderous sound rang and said: "Good! That's it. The last time you hunted my subordinates, I can forget. You can also hunt in my country in the future, but only if you can only start with ordinary demons. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then I am gone! This is the coordinate. "The legendary mage popped a blue light ball with his fingertips and shot at Bai Menggao. Then he flew backwards and appeared in a few dozen kilometers. She suddenly fell and picked up from the ground. A big demon, then in the roar of Bai Menggao, open the portal and escape.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
