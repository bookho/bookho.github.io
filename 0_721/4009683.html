			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the duel, both Papan and Richard began to sing a spell and match Take the corresponding magic gesture. Papan's gestures are clear and clear. At first glance, he knows that it is the most practical and powerful magical missile in the first level of magic. In terms of magical rumors, Papan's foundation is very solid, and even the most discerning teacher can't find any problems in this magical display. There should be only two magic missiles cast by the first-level magician, but there are three magical lights in Papan's hands! Immediately a slight commotion in the crowd, they were surprised by Papan’s magical talent. The magical missile's casting time is the shortest. When Papan's magic missiles come out, Richard's magic is not ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the three missiles locked in the middle of the missile, and the other two were shot to the left and right sides of Richard. With Papan's current strength, he can only control one of the three missiles for complete target locking. With such a tactical setting, the opponent can be hit by two missiles at the same time no matter which direction he evades! If Richard does not hide, it is equal to a magical missile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papan knew that a missile could not solve Richard. When he was fighting, he personally experienced the surprisingly strong body of this kid, but he actually has two The magic of the level mage, a total of three magic missiles can be released. The bombing of three rounds of missiles is enough to make the kid unable to find the north! And Richard has just completed the registration of the first-level magician, and released up to two rounds of magic missiles. Papan estimates that he can still fight a bombardment, although it is very painful, and twice it can not bear. No way, the magic duel is like this. If he is a third-level wizard, there will be no suspense in winning, then the duel will not be approved at all. Dark blue is fair. I want to let Dark Blue temporarily ignore certain injustices, but it needs a very strong background and huge material input. Papan's family is still far from this level of countertops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three magical flies, Papan set out to prepare the next round of magic missiles. The opposite Richard did not prepare for the magic, so Papan felt that the goddess of victory was already showing his thighs to himself. As soon as he thought of the equipment, gold coins and status promised by the man behind the scenes, Papan's heart could not help but itch, so that the pronunciation of the magic spell was somewhat inaccurate, and the 1.5 second cast time was dragged into 2 seconds. However, the magic in the hands is not ready yet, and Papan’s ear heard the sound of a tsunami from the audience! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is cheering? Is it a victory for me?" Papan thought, but he still has a minimum of self-knowledge. Then some of them looked up awkwardly, suddenly widened their eyes, and even half of the magic prepared for it was forgotten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papan can hardly believe his eyes! What did he see? Is that a fireball? How can a level 1 magician release three levels of magic, isn't the magic duel prohibiting the use of reel items? Why is there a fireball? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genuine fireball has already flown out and flies in the direction of Papan. Fireball has no locking function, but the high-speed flight and spells themselves do not need to be locked for a full range of damage of ten meters. Until the fireball flew less than five meters away, the stunned Papan woke up from the shock, and he screamed, and even flicked to the side to dodge. However, Papan, who played the fastest speed in his life, only ran three meters, and was caught up by the rolling waves! A slamming sound, Papan was blown up and flew up, and a short arc was drawn in the air, only to fall heavily on the ground a few meters away, and could not climb again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden turn from deadly to dead in the duel, and everyone held their breath subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortage of knowledgeable masters in the audience. It can be seen that the power of Richard's fireball is much smaller than the standard three-level magic, but the impact of 10 levels is enough for any magician below level 3. critical hit. Although Papan was not killed on the spot, he had to take a few dozen days to hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A squeaking noise, once again attracted the attention of the audience. Papan's magic missile, when he arrived in front of Richard, he rubbed his chest with a hard-hitting bomb, and then began to prepare a second magic without a slight deviation from his expression and gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the duel in the duel field was so clear that the feathers were clearly audible. Although the voice of Richard’s magic spell was very low, it was also perceived as superb. Several big magicians heard it, so they were moved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although magic spells have been drastically modified, they are still recognizable, and Richard’s second magic is actually fireball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard is pale, and the high speed of the magic makes him feel like the body is being evacuated. He only has less than 4 points of magic, relying on magic to recover. The effect of the pharmacy has recovered a little. The spell he prepared was a version of Fireball that reduced the magical spending again, and it has not been researched and perfected. But even if it is perfect, it needs 6 magic points to release a small fireball with a level of 8. Only a strong belief supports Richard, let him not hesitate to cause magical overdraft and also to complete this magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball is small, but killing is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the resident mage flashed to the center of the field, waving his hand to dispel the unfinished magic of Richard, and also stabilized the magic of the disorder for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, you will have his life when you release this magic. This is not in line with the rules of the magic duel." Here, the resident mage looks back. After watching Papan's situation, he announced: "The winner of this duel is Richard! Now, Richard, you can ask the other party to perform according to the prior agreement... Well, the agreed bet. The execution location can Choose it separately. Of course, I personally suggest that you choose one...呃...similar, flexible...execution method, which also meets the rules of magic duel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After listening to the resident mage, Richard went to the side of Papan, who was still standing still, rudely pulled his head and looked at the face that was soaked by the fireworks, so as not to have any feelings. The voice said: "Anyone once told me that if someone wants to explode your ass, then you have to explode him twice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end, Richard stood up and used all his strength to kick in the middle of Papan's ass! Papan made a pig-like call, and then turned to be a cry of laughter, screaming, and intermittent. Richard took two steps out and suddenly turned and added a foot to Papan! This foot immediately raised Papan's voice by another octave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard’s feet, the eyebrows of the resident mage can’t help but feel a little discomfort in the middle of the hip. However, in his view, Richard's foot is obviously more benevolent than the implementation of the agreed bet, so this implementation is tacitly announced, and the end of the duel is announced. The people in the audience began to exit, they were very excited, constantly discussing Richard's fireball, and Papan's ass naturally no one pays attention. Obviously, this will be a hot topic for a long time to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the box, Minnie and Randolph did not expect this to be the result. Minnie suddenly snorted and said: "Randolph, you are right, it seems that Little Richard is worth 500,000 gold coins!" After that, she did not call Randolph, but went outside the box. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
