I can provide the standard level 14 and potential level 17 candidate knights, but they don't have Orleans' surnames or mounts. They can sign a magic slave contract with you. In the future, other treatments need to be equal to Standard construction knight. Every time I provide a person, I need to get 200,000 compensation. How many people do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to frown at this time, after this After a period of accumulation, there are already 15 sets of packages that he has accumulated on his hands. Moreover, there are a large number of semi-finished products completed by Qi Qi, so that in the Faro plane, as long as there is a month, Richard can complete five sets of suits. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard’s brain is operating at high speed and repeatedly weighing, he is still sensitive to Agamemnon’s candidate for a knight, no Orleans. It is the surname of the Duke of Iron and Blood, and he is very clear about the meaning behind this sentence. Richard's double eyebrows then stretched out and decided to let go of some of his secrets to two friends who had died together, so he extended two fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because two? No, if it is this quantity, then I will send you directly," Nyris called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Twelve?" Agamemnon tempted to ask, obviously not to believe. In his view, Richard can build five more knights as the limit of imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm voice of Richard, but like a thunder, will be Both Reese and Agamemnon jumped up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible?! Really fake?" Nyris exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's fake, how can I let you kiss?" Richard laughed and cried, and opened a joke that was not suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nerris a glimpse, but began to seriously consider. The result made Richard feel creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard’s face is getting more and more ugly, Nyris laughed and said, “Let you talk nonsense! Is this honest? Well. I have a new proposal, do you want to think about it. You sell the ten sets of structures to us, the price is in accordance with the royal purchase price. And we provide you with twenty candidate knights, ten of which are for you, and ten others. Give it back to us after half a year of work. How do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly calculated it in his heart and frowned and said, "Where can you get it?" Eight million? Is it not necessary to divide the profits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris and Agamemnon looked at each other, but smiled and shrugged and said: ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the knight build a point?" asked Li. This question is the key. Before the basic combat power is not up to standard, it is not a good choice to increase the construction of the knight. In particular, if the knights are not enough, they will not form a deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Nyris nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The five million, but you give me ten magical slavery contract reels," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon sighed and said, "Richard, this is not good. We still want to be friends with you for a long time, we can't make you lose in formal transactions. Of course, we will not let ourselves suffer." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Reassured, five million I still earn. Don't look too small for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five million still earned?!" Nyris's eyes lit up, and suddenly shouted: "Licha! I love you!" Then he made a fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sat as he was, and did not move, laughing and watching Niris. The movement of the four emperors was halfway, the forehead began to drip, and then squatted back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha quietly sighed, this kind of thing, it really is who has no lower limit who will win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides negotiated everything smoothly, and Richard sent a person to Greenson to chase Oral and let him call Longmaer Lina back. Lina is now the highest in his side, and the trust between the two sides is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask for gold coins from Nyris and Agamemnon, but instead took up two million spares, all replaced with weapons and equipment. . The big heads are all handcuffs and armored arrows. The value of seven million enchanting equipment, can allow Richard to arm a thousand people's killing machine, which is not super-elite in Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of departure is almost here, and the candidate builders have assembled and first entered the Faro plane. And Richard even took all the 20 or so mages who were hired to the Faro plane. This time, Richard can be said to have come out of the nest, murderous, ready to attack the enemy who dared to enter Faro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the Temple of Eternal Dragon, the sand is standing in front of the book of Time, silently praying for something. A strip of time light spilled from her and wrapped around the book of time. There is a transparent mask on the book of Time, trying to resist the pulling of the time belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khan continued to shed from the sand forehead, her body was shaking slightly, but the mask did not move. At this moment, the sand has been transmitted through the book of Time to see that someone is transmitting from Noland to Faro. The target coordinates are the time lighthouse in Oasis. The first reaction of Richard was to use the time difference between the temporary transmission and the permanent passage to mobilize all the forces of the party and fight the meat grinder again under the Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​quicksand is even more completely determined. She tries to use the book of time to influence the sender’s placement with the power of time. It is best to send them. The destination moved to a certain place. For example, the turbulent time of the turbulent land, or the center of the sea, the active volcano can also be inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let her try her best, until the power is exhausted, and the transmitter’s point of departure is not moved. The temporary passage of the other side was unexpectedly stable, and it can be seen that the other party is prepared and will definitely win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a cold face, with a hand to caress, slowly closes his eyes, ready to pray to the dragon of eternal and time, and then in the way of overdraft Forcibly drag the dropper of the sender. But she also knows that this time the overdraft, I am afraid it is the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, her head suddenly felt a pain, and had been knocked hard by the staff, and the prayer was naturally interrupted. Liu Sha holding his head, furious, looking back, it turned out that Vatican stood behind her, that is, she used the scepter of the great priest to give a sand head to her, and she simply interrupted her practice of borrowing money from the old dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great God Officer, how are you..." The sand sand just wanted to say something. When I saw a few time bands from the right hand of Vatican, I was entangled in the book of time, and immediately swallowed the complaints to the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin sighed and said, "Sand sand, you, let me say how good you are. Just be the last warning I gave you, thousand Don't go overdraw the gods that you can't even surrender! Be sure to leave a glimmer of hope for yourself, even if it's a little bit better. Otherwise, you will regret it. This time I can help you, but it is also the last time. Are you sure you need my help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand biting the lower lip, but without hesitation, nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin shook his head and sighed again, saying, "You, as I did at the beginning, until I used up the last grace, I found that I never Even if it is a little bit to use..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin gently shakes the great scepter, and the right hand mentions that the book of time begins to move slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape looks at the noble and beautiful, sacred, pure but lonely figure of Vatican. I don’t know why, suddenly I feel my nose slightly sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, where are you going to move the placement?" Vatican said quickly that she was also very struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand of the stream is bright, and hurriedly said: "Underground, central sea, or crater, time and turbulence area will do!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin laughed and laughed and said: "You are really sincere! It is much stronger than I was. I will give the undead a treatment at that time, and add an aging to the young girl who can’t look good. Seriously, tell me the distance and direction that need to be moved relative to the time lighthouse!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is slightly thought, said: "Southwest, Seven hundred kilometers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin is angry: "It can't be that far! Within four hundred kilometers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three hundred and seventeen kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin grew a sigh of relief, and the right hand took a lead, then said: "Become, What is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A human kingdom in this plane, but the church headquarters of a powerful god is located there," said Liu Sha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really awkward, it’s much better than I was!” Vatican praised, and when he played his finger, a few golden lights fell into it. Inside the light curtain of the book of Time. A glimpse of the sand, did not understand what the purpose of Vatican's move, so I asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, I just made the transmission bigger, so that the Faro’s face of the gods should not be dead, it should be I know someone is coming." Vatican said in an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand looks at Vatican, speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two generations of oracles are surprisingly similar in some respects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Faro plane, a storm is quietly brewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the courage of the god of courage, the courage of the great temple, the pope is sitting on the high back chair, with a single piece of crystal glasses on the bridge of the nose, carefully flipping through the front a report. The report was not long, only a total of three pages, but the Pope read it word by word, and his eyes finally fell to the end of the entire report, and it was almost an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
