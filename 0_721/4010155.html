But it seems to think of something, and it has been drilled out of the hair, and the anger is staring at Richard. And its tip has actually started to beat a few small purple electric balls! Obviously, if Richard wants to start again, it is not as simple as piercing the palm of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, of course, will not be stupid to that point, haha ​​smile, and grow away. Only the blond hair was left sulking in the original place, and the purple electric balls were smashed around, and then annihilated in the brilliance of the blue, no sound, only blooming white flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not see that after he left, Su Hailun’s lips floated on a sneak peek, then he lazy Body, changed position and continued to sleep, this time it also sounded soft snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stepped out of the heavy steel gate, Richard unexpectedly saw that Black Gold and Phil Master were still waiting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you see your Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is Your Highness?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great magisters asked anxiously. The legendary mage is the soul of the deep blue. The deep blue is now a huge gathering place for wealth, and it is still in the rush. Once the legendary masters have something, it is impossible for these great magisters to keep the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at it for a moment and said, "I can’t see it. There is a power in the teacher that hinders all the magic and ability to detect perception. But it looks The teacher should have nothing to do for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, that's good!" Just as Richard was hesitating, the Grey Dwarf had already rushed out. Khan, now I am relieved. The violent chest is a sign of how fast his heartbeat was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are the new Griffins ready?" Richard asked as he walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold said: "Already prepared, a total of four griffins. Also equipped with enough vitality. But are you sure you will leave now? You still I haven’t eaten anything and need rest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, “I have to go back immediately. I’m going to the Faro plane time flow rate. Ten times that of Noland. I can't stay any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold and Phil are familiar with Richard's character and there is no further persuasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also familiar with the operation of Deep Blue, and suddenly asks: "Master Black Gold, how long can the deep blue stay after the teacher sleeps?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf's face immediately seemed unnatural, hesitating for a long time, said: "His Royal Highness did not open any private warehouse to the deep blue before going to sleep, but asked for everything before going to sleep. You It should be known that it is difficult for Deep Blue to maintain huge expenditures. This is even more so. His Highness is very busy. The small things that have been balanced and balanced have always been ignored. This negligence is also normal. But I have the existing reserves in hand. At most, it is enough to support the deep blue for one year of normal operation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair suddenly said next to him and said: "If we old guys only receive one-third of the original subsidy If you can, you can support it for four more months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf frowned fragilely and opposed: "This can only be a measure of rights. Of course, we have a few people who have been with the Highness for a long time, of course, there is no problem, but other people? Not all the big magisters will be willing to pay for the deep blue. Several of them are more concerned about the dark blue environment and resources. If you cut the subsidies of all the big magisters, they are likely to leave, which will affect the reputation of the dark blue!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil sighed and didn't go on. Black gold is right, there are many Masters in Dark Blue, but most Masters and Deep Blue are the cooperative or employment relationships that are required. Once Deep Blue does not have enough subsidies, many Masters will choose to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei stopped and asked: "What is the deficit gap in Deep Blue today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Black Gold said without thinking: "This year should be between 3 million and 4 million, and may expand next year. This is still based on no major events."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked: "How much is the Master directly assigned to Dark Blue, which can be deployed for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the big magisters, there are 31 people above the fifteenth level, and there are seven hundred and twenty mages in the tenth to fifteenth grades. Among them, there are a total of three hundred and thirty magistrates." Remember to be very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I will find ways to gradually use them. As for the deep blue maintenance funding gap, let me find a way." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Dwarf was shocked and exclaimed: "That is a gap of nearly four million!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know." Richard said very plainly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already taken the lion’s back and waved to the two great magisters. He drove the gryphon into the night sky and flew in the direction of Fausd. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one day, the Griffin carried Richard slowly to land on the floating island of Archimonde. The four griffins arrived on the floating island, and although they were exhausted, they were not exhausted. The quality of the dark blue higher gryphon is much better than the superior gryphon outside, not to mention the superior gryphon of the Archimonde standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard casually ate something, he took all the equipment and walked away from the floating array. Half an hour later, the plane of the plane in the Eternal Dragon Hall lit up with a flash of light, and Richard disappeared into the transmission line leading to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dark blue one round trip, the Faro plane is a month passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to the Blue Water Oasis, this war-torn city once again became alive and well, full of people and people busy with building houses. The building materials, the wagons and the flow of people almost filled the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the past used to wear durable, rugged clothing for blood-stained areas, but people who are now dressed in aristocratic costumes Greatly increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Oasis City is crowded with people who are at least twice as many as in the past. From time to time, we will hear the sounds of quarrels and physical conflicts. The big and small disturbances are everywhere, but the vitality of the city is much higher than in the past. These are just those who are qualified to enter Oasis City. They look at it and there is a camp outside the city. A large number of carriages stopped around the camp and were rolled into pieces. Outside the Oasis City, there is almost no flat open space. Later, some people began to level the hills and wanted to move out a land suitable for camping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, there are several striking huge buildings under construction, which are warehouses for storing materials. Just looking at the scale, you know that these warehouses are giants that can store thousands of tons of various materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard left, the Blue Water Oasis City was still full of squalor, and the ruins left by the war were everywhere. Most people can only hang in the temporary shack. Living in the body. Even some people can only dig a pit on the ground, and insert a few planks on it, and they will be right. So now that Richard came back, he saw such a scene of enthusiasm, and he could not help but be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, you are back!" Among the followers of Richard, only Oral still maintains such respectful and strict etiquette. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee threw the magic box behind him on the floor and finally relieved and asked, "What about other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pedestrian patrols, suppression of repression, training training. Oh, it’s never let me know where the splashes and twilight are." The Elf poet answered reverently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha took a bit of a sore body, and after a little induction, he knew where the followers were. Gangde was on the patrol, and Sandrud was hiding in the corner of the camp with his death knight, and Tiramisu was in a certain neighborhood, it seemed to be suppressing the riots. Splashes and ochre are at least a few tens of kilometers away from Oasis. I don't know what to do. However, as soon as Richard returned, they immediately sensed and began to move to Oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While walking toward his own command post, Richard said, "What happened during the time when I was not there?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success of the Longitudinal Plan, the nobility was very excited, and the first Westward Caravan was assembling. The caravan will carry more than 6,000 tons of materials, including There are 3,000 tons of grain, and another 2,000 tons of materials are used for the construction of two replenishment camps. The grain will be sent to the dwarf kingdom, and the other aristocratic goods will add up to about 1,000 tons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Put someone to stare at these nobles, don't let them do it on the books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Another thing, the news just arrived this morning, there was a caravan and a warrior who stayed in the Cracked Rock Camp, and several people died."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately stopped and frowned and asked: "Where is the caravan? Why is there a conflict with our people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According back from the front The intelligence, the caravan belongs to the Earl of Lambert in the Iron Triangle Empire. The caravan is very large, the guardian soldiers reach 1,500, and the army we stayed in the cracked stone camp is less than a thousand people. So a small fight, eat After some losses, they returned to the camp and let them go. Yes, Count Lambert is the original owner of the Blue Camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cracked Camp How can there be a caravan in the area, where are they going?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral has prepared and said: “The caravan all the way west, they There are many spirits in the goods that are carried, and it seems that they want to go down the merchant road that we have opened up to the dwarf empire of the pale highlands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sneer, said: "We have spent a lot of money, and opened up the bloody land. This Earl of Lambert wants to be cheap. If there is such a good thing, it seems that the matter of Salenwell has not given them enough. Lessons! It doesn't matter, let them go for a day first, I still need to summon the soldiers, and we will leave after one day! From now on, all caravans without our permission You are not allowed to set foot on this passage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
