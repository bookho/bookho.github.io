The Pope finally broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinals, you see me, I see you, I don’t want to say anything, but it’s clear that there is a consensus on their expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, a cardinal who did not receive the shrine resolutely said: "The believers are the Lambs of God, and the priests and shrine knights are God's human beings. Shepherd. We should do our best to execute the gods, but we need to leave enough sheepdogs to protect the Lambs of God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They finally took the lead and said them In my heart, the cardinalists suddenly lost their hearts and nodded. The pope looked up and glanced at the brave cardinal, and his eyes showed approval, so that the cardinal who was originally awkward was in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same scene is being staged in the shrines of the gods. One battle god group and the Knights of the Temple were formed and sent to the Kingdom of Baroque. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road leading to the Baroque Kingdom, you can always see a team with different flags, and rush into this country belonging to the God of War. The fleet that delivers the logistics supply is not at the end. The size of such a large army is that the Baroque Kingdom, which occupies the rich plains of Pampas, cannot afford to replenish. It needs urgent purchases of grain and munitions from neighboring countries. This is also the case when many troops have provided some supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheduling of the various churches is not flustered, and the advancement of the secular aristocracy is well organized. They all know that there is plenty of preparation time for the gods to jointly fight the gods. Intruders spend a month or more in the transmission channel, and when they walk out of the plane, they are hit by a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important rule for the gods to protect Faro. Throughout the history of Faro, only the invasion of the stars and animals broke the blockade of the gods. From the descending of the gods to the appearance of the star beasts in Faro, it was only three days before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the Temple of God and the church is also different. All churches that can reach the battlefield within the time limit have sent powerful battle gods and knights, and more farther through the costly temple to send a small number of high-ranking priests and sacred knights to the Baroque Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those countries and churches that failed to reach the battlefield in a month, announced that they had prepared a second wave of troops and promised to be in the shrine In the war and the year after it, no war was waged against countries involved in the fight against invaders. It is not surprising that several sudden and weak churches of the gods appear to be slightly reserved in preparation for the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baroque countries are holding a grand ceremony at this moment. King Arnold, a gold armor, is on the 800-level scarlet long-term level of the Great War Temple. . Behind him, there are as many as a thousand kingdom war iron guards who are also dressed in gold armor. At the entrance to the temple, the people who have greeted have been divided into two columns, among them bishops, tyrants, and boys and girls who wear priests as ceremonies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Arnold walked up to the door of the temple up to 20 meters high, the girls immediately took the golden scepter and the scarlet pope robes. Arnold directly put the pope's robe on his body and walked into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is both the king of Baroque and the spokesperson of God of War. The grand and grand prayer ceremony was held under the auspices of Arnold. After a moment, the will of the behemoth of the sea would come, and the voice of God echoed like a thunder in the depths of every devout believer:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pick up your sword and smash every intruder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the gods, Arnold strode to the gate of the Temple of God of War, in the ranks of the thousand At the top, overlooking the neat squares assembled on the square below, suddenly lifted the scepter, the golden light shines, and the war of the Baroque tradition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock, hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold’s voice is as bright as the gods, and spread far and wide, covering a few kilometers around. Everyone who hears his trepidation is full of blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Baroque trench, from the old saying, is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use my sword to honor my god! I use my sword to guard the land and protect the people! Fight, fight, and never lose! Locke, hey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the square, the teams began to turn and went to the battlefield where they were about to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the last phalanx left the square, Arnold returned to the temple, then walked alone to the apse, stepped out of the back door, then climbed up and went to the temple. In front of the hill, an unremarkable, dilapidated little temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple is full of dust, the spider webs are stacked in the corner, several chains are hanging from the top of the temple, and the ends of the chains are from a knee-shouldered shoulder and legs. Go through and limit him to the square. The man turned his back to the door, and there was a strange black hair that fell like a waterfall. The black hair was flowing and it seemed to be a young and very light person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold stood at the door of the temple for a long time, and immediately called: "Zonghu..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh! It's really rare! Five years, this is the first time you come to see me." This is the voice of a young man, lazy, but there is no respect for Arnold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t look back at all, just moved his neck and made a slap in the face, then lifted his right hand and said hello, saying: You can't wait for me to die soon! Since you come to me, there must be something you can't solve. Let me just say, I will see how the mood is. If you are in a good mood, it will help you, who will make you me. Father, haha! However, if you are damn actually bringing me to the world, I can tell you in advance that the cost of letting me go is very big, so big that you absolutely want to hit the wall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold’s face was filled with black air. He looked up and looked at the dome. He opened his mouth silently and read a few words, only to come down and restore. Peace of mind, said: "There are powerful alien plane invaders will appear in the Baroque kingdom, and all the gods have sent their gods. The power of this intruder may be second only to the invasion of the stars. Although I believe this time The war will surely win, but the Baroque kingdom may be destroyed in the war. I need you to The people of the preservation kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man laughed and said, "That is your country, your people! What about me?" I can't wait to kill all of their men, and the women are doing it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arnard is darker, but still bears anger and says: You... If you play this time, the three artifacts of the Temple of War, you can pick and use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three artifacts have to be used? It seems that you The situation is really not so good! So my asking price can be improved." The young Zonghu said lazily, "take all the three artifacts, I can consider it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's impossible!" Arnold broke off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu finally turned back, but it was a beautiful, cold face that was enough to fall into the city, male and female, but spit out from the mouth is still young men’s The voice, clear and powerful, sneered: "Impossible? Who else can you really play the power of the three artifacts besides me? The artifact is in your hands, it is just a dross!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold is silent for a long time, only to say: "Three artifacts can be handed over to you, of course, after the war is to recover. So you can play?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu laughed, like a madman, said: "Father, isn’t it a long time, you really are a madman who only knows bloodthirsty killing? I want to send me ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu extends two fingers Said: "One, I want to be free. Second, the woman in your palace, I have to pick a few to play. Rest assured, after playing, it will be returned to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Arnold seems to be early I expected him to have such a request, saying: "I can promise you both conditions. But after you are free, you can no longer enter the territory of the Baroque Kingdom. As for the second condition, there is no problem, except... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu directly interrupted his words: "If there is a word like 'except', then you don't have to talk about it. You know, I just want to play. The women you value the most. Think about it yourself. It is important to the country and the people, or to your loved ones, my dear father!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Arnold involuntarily stepped back and his face was defeated. He pointed his finger at the Zonghu, his fingers trembled slightly, but after a long time passed, but a word of scolding could not be exported, and finally sighed and said: "I... promise you! After the war..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is before the war! Maybe I will die on the battlefield? I will not leave this opportunity for you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...good." I don't know how much effort I used, Arnold spit out the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu turned his head again and stared at Arnold with a pair of beautiful and bottomless eyes, saying, "You are such a good king!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annold is like not hearing his sarcasm, the golden armor flashes, and a tomahawk, a shield and a helmet appear on the ground. Then he untied a gold waistband from the waist and placed it on the ground. This is the king's token. Holding this waist card is equivalent to Arnold himself. With this waist card, Zonghu can go anywhere, and no one can stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu showed a charming smile, picked up the small tomahawk, and cut off all the chains on his body after a few moments, then pulled the chains one by one. There was rust on the chain and all the blood was pulled from the body of Zonghu. Every time an iron chain is pulled out, Zonghu's face will be distorted for a while, and it takes a while to take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the chains were exhausted, Zonghu’s foot was soft and almost fell. He stared at Arnold and sneered and said: "My dear father, these chains, you really have a bloody! I am afraid that I have to take a week to raise my body. During this time, I will go shopping in Wangdu. If you go out, if you have any trouble, you will take it for me. You better pray that the intruder will not appear in this week. In addition, you will call those so-called towns and strong people, you are such a person. There are quite a few? Although they are very famous, they may not be of much use on the battlefield, but at least there are enough. The other party has to spend a little time on it. It should be able to get me a good injury, right? , father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
