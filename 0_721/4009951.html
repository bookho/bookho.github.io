			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if this is the parent’s self-assertion or for other reasons Or is it just a coincidence. However, from its answer, Richard vaguely raised a thought that he had never had before. The mother's nest may have its own soul and thoughts, not a contractual creature that only knows how to execute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special unit is the same as the creation of other mother nests. When you are born, you pick up the egg shell on the ground and eat it clean. Then the carapace, like a armor, became a little thicker and quickly became hard and bright in the wind. After eating the egg shell, it stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest then passed Richard a special spell called Revelation. The role of revelation is to enlighten the divinity of a particular unit, to inspire its own soul, and to imprint the mark of Richard in its soul. The command of such a special unit was transferred from the mother's nest to the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a special unit has just been created, its soul is still in a state of sleep, just a body. At this time, it is very fragile, and its resistance depends on the creator's strength level of the hen's nest. If there is a master who is so proficient in the spirit of Sandru, or a sandalian such a magician whose soul power greatly exceeds the mother's nest, It is very likely that you will be enslaved from then on. This is why the creation process must be kept secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the message passed by the mother's nest, Richard placed his hand on the forehead of a special unit, chanting a spell, and a little soul fire was sent to its body. Instantly ignites the hidden divinity, and in the raging fire, the soul emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all over the body, and there’s a bright look in the eyes. It first glanced at the mother's nest and said, "Thank you, my creator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special unit suddenly spoke and let Richard be shocked. It then turned around and prayed to Richard according to the custom of the human aristocracy, saying: "I will obey your orders, my master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, Um, this....... well." Richard was aphasia for a moment, and the reality in front of him was too amazing. If he didn't see the whole process of the birth of a special unit, he would definitely think that it was a human being, or something else. What kind of human life is life. Although I have heard from my mother's nest that a special unit will have a soul because of the consumption of divinity, when he really happened in front of him, he could not help but be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many church classics, it has been mentioned with great solemnity that the soul is a unique field of the gods and a restricted area for mortals. Just because mortals can't create souls, they can't create a smart race. Creating people is also an area exclusive to the gods, and it is a field of very few powerful gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to calm down, and Richard said to the special unit: “First wait, I will give you a name. You can’t do it now. You need to get another set for you and block your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is 绯色." Special unit replies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"绯色?" Richard was a glimpse, and asked the mother's nest: "Is this your name?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest immediately replied: "No, master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the twilight also said: "This name is engraved The mark in my soul was born with my soul. So I can only use it as my only name. My real name is 绯色. 珴瑞波斯..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
