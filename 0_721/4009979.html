			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Eugen’s face immediately became irony and shouted: “Li Check out Jazz! You are provoking an earl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A court count." Richard coldly poked Eugen's pain. The territory of the Earl of the Court often does not have a jazz territory. It is not easy to make up the private army of two hundred people and to equip them with radiant armor. Counting on how combatable this army is, it is entirely a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Eugen’s face was blue and purple, and he had to control himself with all his strength to resist the whip in his hand and throw it on Richard’s face. A duel with a great magician is absolutely synonymous with stupidity. Earl of Eugen is only a general problem with the court aristocracy, but not stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to fight with the Count of the Deer and the Duke of Glasgow?" Eugen sipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count, don't forget your identity! Do you have the right to provoke war? Don't forget what you are doing! If you really want to fight one If you are embarrassed, then I can also accompany you. But the advice I want to give you is, I am not prepared to make any ransom from you, a court count can not be worth a few dollars." Richard coldly reminded Eugen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute between domestic aristocracy will often go on the road of war. This is the internal friction of the various vassals who are constraining the vassal, but can not completely stop it. But in general, in addition to blood revenge, the aristocracy must be respected as long as it surrenders, not to mention killing, and the ransom is closely related to the integrity of the captured. Richard may not kill him, but it is easy to lack arms and legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ergan Baron’s face was blue and white, and he couldn’t speak for a while. He really wanted to directly order the impact of the whole army, and cut both Richard and his men in one fell swoop. But reason is reminding Eugen that he really wants to make this order, and only his own private army will obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hundred Guardian light rides are armed by the royal family and are responsible for protecting the mother of Him, the sister of today’s king. This time, the loan to the Baron Eugen was only for his strong momentum, lest the Richard Lions speak loudly. If Eugen’s order jeopardizes the possibility of Him, then the light cavalry may be the first to deal with the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count tried to breathe deeply several times before he suppressed the anger in his chest, and then said coldly: "So, Sir Richard Akmond, you are planning And I am here to talk about ransom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not!" Richard laughed, ransom is always a pleasant word. "Follow me, I will take you to see the Viscount of Him, and then go to my conference room to talk about ransom. But I don't have good black tea and refreshments here, and there are no porcelain and oil paintings. In addition, except for yourself. Outside the guards, all people have to camp on a kilometer away. Of course, those trucks can be sent first!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Count Earl and Heim The Viscount saw one side and confirmed the health of the Viscount. By listening to the screams of the Viscount, you can judge the health of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next negotiation process was somewhat unexpected by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Eugen seems to have been out of anger, in the ransom negotiations, and he has a dedication to fight with Richard. At the most tense moment, Earl of Eugen even threatened to go home, and then exchanged a person to negotiate with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
