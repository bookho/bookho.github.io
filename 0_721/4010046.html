			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is the right-hand man of Earl of Alice, and the count is actually On the second person, Alice's distant cousin, Ms. Farchy, who has an unknown blood. Faschi is not good at war, but has a terrifying fighting talent. He has 19th-level strength in his early twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eleventh grade of Irvine is very clear that even in the open area, a squadron is not enough to kill himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his voice is not falling, the palm that just swung from his face flew back, with another crisp sound, El The other side of the text also swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the end, just the beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s hand waved, and one after another, the slap in the face, Elvin was crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irvine wants to hold the dagger that has been squirted, but the reason tells him that once he does, he will only be killed on the spot! In the name of Faschi, there is no big deal in killing a normal stepping knight. What's more, is this the case now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Elvin forcibly pressed the boiling blame on the bottom of his heart, and endured all the slaps with a tortoise-like patience, just screaming in the bottom of his heart: This 婊 / child! One day, I will do the work of you to die, and then tear your lower body!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascil face frost, continuous pumping Elvin slaps a dozen, which kicks him off. Looking at the members of the branch family who were still in the horror, she snorted in a cold and disdainful look, and looked over them, shouting at their place: "Suya! You give me out! Your current practice has gone beyond A bottom line that Archimonde can tolerate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪! A burst of applause came, and the Baron Suya stepped out of the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Fassie is really amazing, one person can block hundreds of Archimonde!" he said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi did not have any hypocrisy with him. He said to Yan Mei, and said coldly: "They are all children of Gordon, flowing pure. Kemond's blood, can not be hurt by the infighting, this is the bottom line! Suya, you hear clearly, I have no interest in bargaining with you. You do nothing in private, but this kind of thing can not happen again! This is Archimonde's at least pride!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya shrugged and smiled and said: "If I remember correctly, Miss Fache, hello. It’s not an Archimonde. At least the powerful blood power in your body has nothing to do with Archimonde. In addition, these people in front of you are also members of Archimonde, and I have no way to command them." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s face was stunned, and he looked down at the crowd in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya looked at her expression in her eyes and couldn’t help but smile and said: "Miss Fase, don’t underestimate these people, they can also be Ake. Mond. You can't beat them alone, and a beautiful lady like you, maybe some less pleasant things will happen after the defeat! And this kind of thing is that you are dead, the same Can't hide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very vicious threat that makes you feel ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya added another sentence: "However, these are not unsolvable. I only need the bones of the ancient beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi said faintly: This kind of thing also wants to threaten me? If I want to escape, can you stop me? Just let me escape today, then all of you, including you, Baron Suya, will be prepared to bear my revenge for the rest of your life! I will kill everyone who is related to you one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya looks cold and says, "You may not escape!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Faschi gathered a long red-haired long hair and said faintly: "Nothing can't escape. The list of everyone here has already been sent to me." Earl adults. Before I came, the adults had promised me. If I could not leave the floating island, then everyone in your family could endure the attack of the great army. The style of adults has always been squandered. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very plain passage, but not a dull content. The same as Elliott’s talents, she is famous for her arrogance. The land that the army of Ellie has passed through is not lacking in the example of a Jedi that has become a life-forbidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya’s face was sullen and said faintly: “Alice is just an earl.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His statement points out the power gap between Sauron and Ellie, and the territory of Elliott is in the frontier, far away from fascist, and there are more than a dozen large aristocratic territories on the way. Suya is actually courageous to Elvin, but it is not so obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Earl was a little jazz, many people were already marquis. The count is now the count, and many are marquis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s words let Suya’s face pass over a cloud. He narrowed his eyes and stared at Faschi, and asked coldly: “The Earl is wanting to be The owner of this floating island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I only care for the children of Gordon," said Faschi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya nodded and said, "Very good, it seems that our two families will not have too many conflicts at least here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi nodded and said, "I am not interested in conflicts with third parties in other people's territories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a faint sarcasm, but Suya only did not hear, leaving with his men. Faschi is not willing to be too persecuted. Suya is not a good guy, and there are Goliaths on the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look farther, you will know that there are still many enemies around the floating island waiting for an opportunity. Many of them are able to swallow the current floating island of 7-2, but they have not done so. In addition to not wanting to withstand the rest of the siege of Archimonde, another important reason is that the floating island of 7-2 has only recently suffered a lot of grace. If you attack it, it is easy to call the eternal and the disgust of the dragon of time, even It is possible to make the Eternal Dragon Hall directly intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Faschi, the Akmons of the branch family gradually withdrew, and Elvin also forced to leave. But there are some worries in the eyes of Faschi. The difficulty of this time has passed, but no one can guarantee whether it will be so easy to pass the next time. She is just a person, impossible to fight against hundreds of Archimonde. And the followers of Suya, and the people of Count of Goliath, also have stronger strengths than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
