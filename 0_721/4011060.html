			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only such a strong fusion of Neris’s dark Raytheon blood. ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient Thunder Destroyer is the top life in the void, their blood is extremely tyrannical, can subdue the other blood, to force the blood of the blood, This is why the Millennium Imperial Family valued Nyris so much, and even did not hesitate to face it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to explain, Richard has a general idea of ​​what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Sen’s mother’s nest completes the analysis of the Golden World tree. When creating a special unit, Nyris does not know how to convince it, and ultimately With her own as a carrier, she became a brand new and the only dark night, and Nyris also gave up her female identity and turned to eliminate all her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment he was created, he awakened his real name, Hilo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard does not know at the moment that the birth of Hilo is the result of countless coincidences, and behind his powerful power, there is also a heavy price, Nyris Forever disappeared, the mother's nest fell back to the tenth order, and the golden world tree withered half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked deeply at Hilo and said, "Come up, we are going."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, my lord." Hilo immediately leaped to the fly of Richard, and stood behind Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flying scorpion full of soldiers and strongs slowly lifted off, and then entered the transmission channel leading to the abyss, the second time for humans to the abyss The expedition opened the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of human beings, each layer of abyss seems to be the same, the environment is basically a dark red sky, rolling smoke, cracked earth, And the flowing magma, but in the eyes of the strong like Richard and Goshawk, the abyss is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard sees is the chaotic gods of countless flying, which is the realization of the abyss rules. It can be seen that the rules of each abyss are very Big difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devils are everywhere in the abyss, and there are subtle differences between them. The masters of demonics can also infer the different levels of the abyss from these differences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s gaze suddenly bet in a magma pool not far away, where he felt a different life fluctuation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, like a small lake-like magma pool tumbling, dozens of dark red sè stones flew out of the pool and landed on the ground, they Quickly stretched out the limbs and long tails, and also launched a pair of small fleshy wings on the back. These are not stones, but they are some little demons that are huddled together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little devil just appeared, immediately smothered each other and battled into a group. This is the first life-and-death fight that they just happened to be born. In the blink of an eye, most of the little devils Killed and shredded, leaving only the four strongest devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four little devils seem to have a tacit understanding, no longer kill each other, but start to swallow the bodies of their companions, and while they eat, the body begins to grow significantly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the body of the little devil is eaten up, the four little demons that have survived have increased by at least one-third, and the forehead is faint Two sharp corners, when they grow up again, all the forehead corners have evolved into ordinary demons, these are the basic warriors of the Demon Legion, and the largest number of cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The molten pool that can produce the little devil, all over the abyss, do not know how many, every moment, there will be a large number of small The demons are produced, and then they feed on each other. Only about a quarter of the little demons will evolve into demons, and then the devil will evolve into a big demon, a small lord, and finally the big lord, if it is a cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four little demons who had just evolved a little suddenly looked up at the sky, and then screamed in a panic, and there was fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge yīn shadow passed them, and then it was a yīn shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of them, one after another is flying silently, from the cockpit of the cornice, from time to time will reveal a very powerful and horrible atmosphere, let They are also inexplicably shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of flying dragonflies formed a huge team, so they flew in the sky of the abyss. At the bottom, even the big demons began to flee around, trying to find a place to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the raft and stared at the endless abyss. He did not have the escaping demons in his eyes, but was observing the changes in the rules of the abyss. And along the direction of the rule of power, fly to the passage to another abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, there is a singular pattern of dozens of light spots, which is what the strong men of the Ling dynasty era left after exploring the abyss. The footprints of the saints, each light point represents a layer of abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to go through several layers of abyss before he can confirm his position in the abyss and then find the nearest spot before he can The route guided by the footprints of the saints goes to the abyss of Abis, the deepest part of the legendary world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk stood by Richard, while observing and recording the rules of this abyss, he asked: "In fact, I thought when I was in the green continent." Know that you are the strongest person in the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and asked: "The strongest, what do you think?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sentence, Li is actually asking the Millennium Empire. Only the Goshawk is the most aware of the strong situation of the Millennium Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk sighed and said: "Before the final battle with the Reaper, I can definitely say that you are not, but after the final battle, I will never again I can't see you, what happened at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final battle with the Reaper<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Licha secretly sighed, it is hundreds of millions of souls, half the soul of the humans of Faro, carried by him in the name of redemption, the memories, stories and joys and sorrows of hundreds of millions of people. Just merge with him and never have to be with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, these people have left their own brand in the world. In a sense, as long as Richard does not die, then they There is still one. If one day, Richard will die, then these souls will fly out again. Most of them will dissipate forever. Very few people may have other opportunities and a way of being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, these souls do not give Richard too much power. Although Richard's soul is powerful, it is difficult to feed back to the real power of the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But every soul is a world in which human beings, as well as other life with souls, experience the world in ways that are old and sick. Each of their actions, every memory has traces of rules, even the most humble slaves, his body actually has the imprint of the underlying rules of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these rules are too small and too weak. If you want to touch the rules in this way, you will need hundreds of millions of souls. In the name of Richard's redemption, there are hundreds of millions of souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the battle with the Reaper, Richard has been reading the memories of these souls, one by one, experiencing the past, his apparent power It didn't increase much, the magic only grew by one level. What really increased was only the control of the rules. Now, there are nearly a hundred kinds of rules system controlled by Richard, and there are various rules and rules. These are all from Redeemed soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard, he does not know to what extent the strength has reached, but all the skills, knowledge, and the power of the blood and real name are faint The signs of oneness, in the battle, gradually have the taste of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong ones that have been remembered flashed in Richard’s mind, and only one picture was left. It was a scene where Philip and his meal together, I don’t know. Why, Richard’s memory of the image of the emperor’s chewing dragon ribs at the time was particularly profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha then took a deep breath and said: "If Philip is still alive, I should not beat him. In addition, Vatican may also play. However, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God eagle's face flashed differently, saying: "Vatican is not counted, you are not clear about her true state, she is actually not at all Noland, even if she is standing in front of you, in fact, there is a time and space that cannot be measured between you. As far as I know, as early as decades ago, Vatican has already used up his own time and invested Time is flooding, so what you see and perceive at that time is not the real Vatican, but can be said to be an incarnation of the old dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The eternal and the incarnation of the dragon of time." Richard stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
