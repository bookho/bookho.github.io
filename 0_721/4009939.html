			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s double-knife holds the baron’s stabbing sword Winch, take the stab sword to the side, and then the left hand short knife is ready to stab the throat. However, the baron's vindictiveness suddenly provoked, although not very fierce, but full of resilience, the wrist shakes a few times, even out of her double-knife smashing, but also a sword stabbed her nearly bare/naked chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair frowned slightly, the pressure from the hand showed the strength of the opponent, she began to move to the side without a trace, just pull a little distance, Can immediately play the ability to flash, giving the opponent a fatal blow from an unintended angle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Baron’s swordsmanship, like his vindictiveness, was unexpectedly flexible, and he clung to Sinclair with no gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides are going back and forth like this, the sword and the double-knife are fighting. I don’t know how much, although the baron is at a disadvantage, he still has the counterattack, the skill of the sword. It’s all right. For a time, Hinckler was actually entangled in the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Richard calmly watched, and he succeeded Baron Fontaine in starting the dispatching command, while blessing the baron in the fierce battle to give Fang Dan The fighting power lasts longer. On the other hand, Richard indicated that the two eight-level magicians under the Baron Fontaine continued to release the dispersal of Sinclair. Although their rank is low, the dispelling magic is not affected by the target magic resistance, so Sinclair The three gain magics were successfully dispelled one by one. In just one minute, Richard issued seven orders, and the soldiers on the wall moved accordingly. The formation is a bit confusing. However, there are more than seven orders issued by Richard in the secret. The contractors he belongs to and the soldiers led by the wind teeth are interspersed and reunited to the position he has designated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the town bear knight has rushed to a distance of tens of meters from the castle, and the lion is squatting down the city, looking for the opportunity to start. The walls of the dusk castle are not high. Not only can the lions jump up, but the cumbersome town bear knights can find a place in midair to borrow a force, and they can jump to the wall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the situation on the battlefield is completely in accordance with its intended operation, that is, when the small chaos is also within the expected range, Richard suddenly has a condescending, overlooking the world and Control the illusion of all things in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact and shock of Sinclair, the town bear knight and the great magician who has just left the range of the heavy range have gradually faded. All the chaos in the city is an illusion. When the soldiers all reach the designated position after one minute, the bears and knights of the town will face much greater pressure and damage when they board the castle, and the resistance they encounter will be stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course most people won’t notice the difference, but Richard knows that the key to this battle is the accumulation of these small bloody wounds. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also noticed that the situation on the castle was changed by Sinclair. Under the entanglement of Baron Fontaine, she could not do every move on the battlefield like Richard Making a judgment, but the keen war instinct made her smell a dangerous taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a swept eye, Hinckler knows that several people are moving to their side, apparently intending to cover the siege. She just smiled coldly. In her battle with Baron Fontaine, how could ordinary people plug in? The Baron Fontaine, who has the equivalent of fifteenth-level power, is a waste in her eyes, not to mention the little ones who are only eleventh-level. What she is thinking about now is whether it is worthwhile to get rid of this annoying reptile with a small wound, or wait patiently for the other side to reveal flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard... He is the goal of Sinclair’s trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timing came at the next moment, and the speed of the double-knife speed of the Sinclair suddenly increased, and the shadow of the Chinese male Dan’s Baron retreats, and the surrounding people have been unable to intervene. The soldiers had a blood arrow in their throats, and they swayed and fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this moment, Sinclair stepped sideways, and the flattering eyes were already eyeing Richard. Her right hand long knife has been turned into a reverse grip, and the forearm next to the knife is pressed forward. At the moment, she clearly had nothing in front of her, but when the knife was pressed to the end, the blade edge would flash in front of Richard’s throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the battlefield, the unpredictable body has always been the most deadly advantage of Sinclair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her body, the image began to distort and the edges of the characters became blurred. In her mind's expectations, a line has been drawn up with Richard, and all the obstacles in the middle will be smothered by her at an extraordinary speed, or directly killed, anyway, when the long knife in the right hand When it is in place, it will definitely be on the throat of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is a magician, and all the magicians are the same in the eyes of Sinclair. Even if the big magister is surprisingly close to her, it is more than a few knives. The long and short double knives in her hands have powerful destructive attributes, even in Noland, which is close to the level of quasi-artifacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s right foot toe point, the body is full of enthusiasm, the moment that bursts out, suddenly heard that Richard screamed like a scream: "Running sand!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice is so fast and too eager that in the view of Sinclair, Richard’s face is somewhat distorted and also makes her A slight glimpse. Flowing sand? This is a familiar name that seems to have been heard but not clearly remembered. She only hesitated the moment that she couldn't capture, and she continued to rush to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly! Sinclair suddenly discovered that the world around her had changed. She was like a fish in the water. The deformed face of Richard was spreading in all directions, so that all the scenery was distorted by the waves. The movements around the people speeded up several times, and the sound heard in her ears became sharp and shredded, as two pieces of rust iron rubbed against each other, and the content could not be discerned. But that should be the cry of the surrounding enemies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, she will understand that what she has heard is indeed the human voice, but these sounds have also been accelerated several times, so it seems so sharp Sorghum is rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair is slamming forward, her feet are off the ground, the vindictive distortion of the surrounding images, and stimulating the eyes of others, They have a hard time seeing themselves. The super high speed of an instant burst is enough to cause the illusion that stealth disappears. However, now, when other people move a few times faster, she becomes the slowest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened, what must have happened! An unprecedented fear in the heart of Sinclair. But her thoughts were as slow as the movements, and until now I couldn't figure out what happened. The only thing that made her feel good was that many of the soldiers’ eyes were sweeping around and trying to find her. In other words, she is still in a semi-invisible state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Sinclair suddenly felt a slight burning pain, and suddenly saw a layer of light on the surface of the body barely visible. Golden flames. This is a pure fire of divine power. It can hardly be dispelled except for the magician and the great magician. It will always hurt her. But the most fearful thing for Sinclair is that after the flame is on, it will break her stealth effect. In addition, the driving force of the flame is the power of the eternal and the dragon of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
