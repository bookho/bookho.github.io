			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall banged and there was a big hole, Tiramisu The big head came in, but it was a little dizzy because of the wall. Seeing that he had not fully focused his eyes, he knew that he would not have seen what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, there are three priests and two pastors who simultaneously swear to the body of Richard, not to mention that Richard’s vitality is strong, that is, the new dead. It is possible to be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel took the lead to stop, shrugged and took a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shuihua suddenly looked up and stared at Io. The fighting priest also had a brilliant smile. The reaction of the girl is that all the emotions in the eyes freeze instantly and become cold and solid. It is like a stagnant stagnant water. The left hand has already held the handle of the perpetrator. She has been really killing and no longer hides her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile on the face of Iowo is the same, just spread his hand and said to the girl: "I really don't need me anymore! In fact, he now uses the gods too. It didn't have much effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel suddenly felt something, the whole body was slightly stiff, and the smile condensed in the corner of his mouth. Just behind him, there was a vague murder that made his heart shrink and it was very uncomfortable. Io kept his hands in the same position and slowly turned his head, just to see the twilight standing quietly a few meters away. She wrapped her robes all over her body, revealing only a blushing eyelid. It is the eyes that reveal a look of the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly coughed up and attracted the attention of the water and the eyes of Iowa. His body trembled violently, and he coughed to the end. He finally spit out a few purple-black blood clots. He could also see a few shadows flowing on the surface, and then quickly faded in the air, eventually disappearing. After spitting the hemorrhage, Licha used his left hand to forcefully, holding the elf knife inserted on the floor and slowly stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand rushed to the front of Richard, and checked it up and down. After seeing each wound, he stared at Richard and said it in a word. Road: "You, crazy,!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound on Richard's body has stopped bleeding, but he has not healed. Broken or split bones can be seen through three horrible wounds. Such an injury, even if it has been over-treated by magical techniques, it will continue to be warmed up with the magic of the next few days, and it will take a few days to raise it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound can also see a tangled shadow energy, which is the power to stop the wound from healing. The sacred glow of excessive magic has not completely disappeared, and it still flickers between muscles and blood vessels, but it cannot let these smoky black silks disappear completely. It can only be slowly removed by time. If you want to instantly eradicate the shadow power in Richard, I am afraid that only nine levels of magic can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha faint smiles, as if the injuries were not on his own, and said with ease: "There was a shadow creature suddenly. I have already been killed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand-bown amber eyebrows immediately picked up, almost erected like Su Helun, roaring: "Shadow creature! Why don't you escape, and Is it necessary to choose oneself? There are hundreds of known shadow creatures, of which you can kill more than twenty! You think you are a god, and every time you happen to be able to get rid of it. You just have to escape and give us some time, we can work together to get rid of it! The power of my time is the nemesis of the shadow creature!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and didn't answer, but suddenly grabbed the hand of the sand, put a thing that had been caught in the right hand in her hand and said, "This is for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard said to Oral: "Help me organize this here, I will change the room to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at his palms, there was a crystal black diamond lying there, and there was a shadow in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Drill, only a strong shadow to achieve a certain degree of shadow creatures can be condensed, containing the dual power of shadow and space, is a very precious space material, can be used Equipment in space, or manufacturing gravity equipment. Any shadow creature that can condense the shadow drill should be able to easily kill Richard according to the normal strength comparison. Even Richard who has learned the sacred fighting skills can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the shadow creature that can condense the shadow drill! Are you really crazy?" The sand screamed at Richard's back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not look back, just waved his hand and said lightly: "Is it already done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sound of the sand is a stagnation, I don’t know what to say for a while, I can only watch Richard go. When passing through Iraq and Russia, the fighting sergeant suddenly turned his head and whispered something to Richard. His voice was very light, and the sand was still staring at the shadow drill in the palm of his hand, not paying attention to the action of the fighting priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two followers who heard it. The fighting sergeant said something that sounds very ordinary: "Tomorrow I will treat you with magic, it can be good." Hurry up. I am now a thirteen-level priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s mouth is a smile, supporting the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight just turned upstairs and caught the long knife thrown out by Richard. However, Richard has bypassed the corner of the corridor and has gone far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All followers felt that Richard wanted a person to be quiet, so they didn't keep up. When the sand was gripping the shadow drill in her hand, Richard had already left. She wanted to catch up, but she could feel the alienation of Richard’s back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a bite, just want to keep up, just take a step to stop, look around, then found the atmosphere is very different. All the followers of Richard stood in the same place as the sculpture, but the air pressure around them was rapidly decreasing, and the air began to have a strong murderous hover. Setting off the room that has become ruin, it seems to have entered a battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu always grabs the one-sided horn on his shoulder, and Gangde moves his finger joints from time to time. Oral looked relaxed, but quietly retreated to the corner, arms around his chest. However, as long as the elf poet blows a few whistles, there will be a war song effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is not disguised, the right hand clasps ‘extinction’, and the fierce light in the pupil flashes. The water flower simply held the leader of the perpetual sleeper in the hand, and the feet were separated, only to the point of the toes. If a girl starts to crouch, it is a harbinger to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All followers of Richard, this moment, are actually in a state of war! The sand was looking around, and her instincts made her secretly vigilant. Followers, the gestures that are now being made are obviously not in a camp with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel still stands against the wall, lazily holding his arms, and his face is filled with sunshine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several followers looked at each other and exchanged a lot of information in their eyes. The eyes of the water flower are extremely fierce, so the Gangde staller expressed concession and let the girl out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand of the water flower gripper is relaxed, then the long fingers are tightened one by one, and the long knife is used to guide the knife to the ground, and it starts to tremble sharply. Howling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl pointed to Io and shouted: "You, put your hands down and stand straight! Otherwise I will cut them off."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel’s eyes are very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shuihua, what are you doing?" asked the sand frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not pay attention to the sand, but raised the knife. The twilight eyes lit up and the blade on the left arm sneaked out. Gangde clenched his fists, and Tiramisu rubbed his feet unconsciously. Oral stood up straight and his face was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several pastors didn’t understand what was going on, and Clark seemed to suddenly wake up. He immediately stepped back a few steps away from the room and was easy. Take the pastors together. This is not the conflict they should be involved in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russ finally laughed, stood up straight, then spread his hands and said, "Is it okay? No need to be so serious?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flower is staring at Iowo like a wolf. After a while, he said in a slightly hoarse voice: "We are not friends, don't make fun of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is shocked and angry, cried: "Shuihua, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls wave, sleep The guide has returned to the back of the scabbard, and then looked at the sand, a word, did not send, turned and left. Other followers also followed the water, no one and farewell farewell. Clark, who had already returned to the corridor with the priests, looked around and sneaked away. This occasion is not suitable for him to blend in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins of the room, only the sand and Iraq are left. The sand-stained face suddenly sank and stared at Io, saying, "What is going on here? Why do they want to do it for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is a misunderstanding "Io-Russia has restored sunshine and relaxation in front of the drifting sand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is staring at Iowa, saying in a word: "It is better to misunderstand! Remember your identity, and the purpose of my creation!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the sand drifted to Io and left. After the drifting sand went away, Iowa took a breath and looked at the direction of the drifting sand. He whispered to himself: "My identity? Oh, maybe after a while, it will change. You, after all, too. Young. In fact, as long as the words are spoken, isn’t it a matter of explanation? Anyway, I will not speak for you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Io is leaving at a leisurely pace. In more than ten meters, the twilight appeared quietly. She thought hard, she just heard the words of Iowo. But she doesn't understand why she can hear this. The priest can't be a guy who doesn't like to talk to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to a room, closed the door, and took a chair to sit down, which was a sigh of relief. He sat for a while before raising his right hand, and another shadow drill lying in his hand. The shadow creatures that came in this time are actually two, one is the shadow warrior, and the other is the tomahawk that the warrior has turned into a hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
