However, it is already sufficient to know that Su Hailun will express his joy to Stevenson. I believe this news will make Stevenson feel happy and have more expressions. However, on the way to the magical transmission array, the master of art suddenly slowed down and was amazed at his own transformation. From what time, I have become so embarrassed that I will help an unfamiliar young aristocrat to pursue the object that I once admired. Just for the money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the master of art immediately struggled. There is a voice desperately arguing that almost every big mentor is fighting for the joy of Su Hailun, isn't that also for gold coins? The big mentors are doing this. What can he hold for a small sergeant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, reason and experience are ruthlessly reminding the masters of art, the two are not the same. All the great mentors have their own bottom line to do things, they contribute to the deep blue in their own way, and get a reward they deserve. Su Hailun’s joy is not a causeless one, but more recognition of their achievements and hard work. And these older magisters, looking at Su Hailun's eyes is like facing a cute little girl, willing to accompany her to laugh and play. Of course, there are also people who only work for gold coins, but their common feature is dedication, and every gold coin earns peace of mind. The guy who really has no bottom line can't survive with the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this thought, the master immediately felt that the gold coins and magic crystals in his pockets became hot. He couldn't help but think that it was because of the gradual decline of self-abandonment that it was impossible to create works that truly satisfied him from a few years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the living room, after the master of art left, Su Hailun’s eyes have not left the portrait of himself, and the look in his eyes is more and more complex. A group of magisters, look at me, I look at you, they all seem to be worried. The intention of Stevenson is very obvious. They are not worried that Su Helun will not see it, but now Su Hailun’s performance is really abnormal, which makes them faint. Is the legendary wizard really touched by the motivated young man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for a long time, finally the gray dwarf couldn’t help it. After coughing a few times and causing Su Hailun’s attention, he said loudly: “Your Highness, you have not Decided on the rewards that Stevenson should have this month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen heard the abnormal tone of the gray dwarf, but his eyes remained on his portrait. While casually saying: "It’s better for a hundred gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... how much?" The Grey Dwarf did not believe his ears for the first time in his life. Seeing that the legendary mage has just been obsessed with portraits, that is, hearing a million will not make him feel so shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary wizard finally found his little head out of the portrait, and some impatiently said: "One hundred! I can't tell you? You How much do you want to give? Are you planning to pay for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah no! Of course not! You are joking, I have money!" Gray dwarf eager Shaking his hands, rarely rushing. The gray dwarf has a similar hobby to the dragon. The gold coin is not a currency for him, but the more the better the collection. Letting him pull out the gold coins is as painful as cutting his beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage’s small nose wrinkled and snorted and said, “This is not the case! In addition, send 10,000 to the guy who just left. The painting is good, the level has risen a lot, and you need to reward him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold did not understand why Su Helun would present a portrait of Stevenson, but said he would reward the master of art. Several of the great magisters present were thoughtful, depending on the degree of closeness, exchanged their eyes and nodded slightly. Of course no one thought of confusing the gray dwarf without any artistic cells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Su Hailun did not take what they meant. She raised the portrait in her hand and said, "Look, the composition of the painting and even the basic tone. They all have the style of the guy just now, only the coloring levels and details of the portrait part are not. So it is clear that the guy just played the draft and the background first, and finally the color is painted by Stevenson! Hey, how many of you What expression did you just say? Um?! I really thought my sister couldn’t see it! I remember it to my sister! Be careful with your bill for next month! Also, black gold! You should also study art well. Don't know how to deal with gold coins every day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf nodded desperately and said: "His Royal Highness! I must study hard, next time I will participate in the Holy Tree Dynasty. At the Treasures Conference, I will definitely go back and find some famous paintings that can really appreciate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes are back to his own portrait, reluctantly After a few glances, I sighed quietly and said, "In fact, I saw this. Painting only makes me closer to making a decision. Well, don't talk about it. Do you have anything else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phil Going forward, I will tell you more about what Richard learned from Naa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of Richard’s business, Su Hailun’s eyes immediately lit up, and did not wait for Phil to speak, immediately interjected: “No wonder Richard will suddenly There was a breakthrough in the magic pattern. It turned out that this guy was in the middle of it. Master Phil, do you think this will have a negative impact on Richard’s future achievements?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Phil has already thought about this problem and shook his head and said, "No, it is very likely to be beneficial to Richard in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen's The eyes immediately lit up with a dangerous light: "Someone wants to start with my Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil quickly said: "It doesn't mean this. But we can already be sure Richard can be a builder, and the builders rarely get to the battlefield. Learning more about the darkness of the art will help him survive in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage nodded and said: "This is also true. But Naa actually dared to teach my students secretly without my permission, courage It was as big as it was in the past. The original disaster blade was a very annoying guy. I used to want to give him an impressive lesson, but this guy actually hides like a little mouse, regardless of his reputation. I didn't expect it, he actually hid in the dark blue, um, good, very good, hey, hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter at the legendary mage When it became very strange, all the big magisters were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naya is indeed courageous enough to offend Su Hailun and still dare to hide in the dark blue, have to say that this is indeed a surprisingly good idea. Only now that his identity has been made public, it is too late to leave the dark blue immediately. Su Hailun may not be the most powerful in the legend, but it is indeed the most vengeful, so her ability to hunt and track is as famous as magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the killer identity of the disaster, no one cares. In the dark blue, the flow of people in the fringe can be comparable to the capital of a small country. I don’t know how many people who have been living in the shadows, as long as they honestly abide by the rules of dark blue, no one will pay attention to their past. Dark blue only maintains its own rules, and the rules of the outside world are not allowed in dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun bit his lower lip and said with some distress: "The disaster blade has offended me, but it is only a small matter, but then I also turned to his decades of private possession... Well, it has been so many years, It’s not too bad. Now he’s quite fluent, and he’s teaching real things. He’s not hiding at all, but it’s not good to deal with...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the gray dwarf stepped forward and reminded: "His Royal Highness, Tax!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Su Hailun. I have to admit that her reaction has been slower than just a few shots these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Naya does not pay taxes! He receives a tuition fee of one thousand gold coins from your Richard every day, but does not pay taxes! This is in ** Steal your gold coins naked!” The gray dwarf became more excited and began to dance to strengthen the tone of his statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful little eyebrows of the legendary mage are also erected! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, she and the Grey Dwarf have a common good, that is, gold coins. She sat up in a hurry and said, "Black gold! Go to Naa immediately and collect the tax collected! With a few people, he has several associates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf is straight and straight, like a gorilla, slamming his chest and screaming loudly: "No, I can go by myself! Here is dark blue!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is like a real warrior, striding out of the living room, the imposing manners of the knights ready to charge after the array, the magician in the presence all revealing the expression of disapproval. Everyone has been working together for almost ten years. It is clear that after the meeting room, the gray dwarf will definitely call a dozen law enforcement mages, and then dare to go to the trouble of the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is over here. After the big magisters left, Su Hailun looked at the portrait for a long time, and then asked the attendant to call Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where Richard and the legendary mage meet is an elegant and cozy little hall, not the grand hall of the kilometer between the mountains and rivers. The legendary mage arbitrarily covered a long coat outside the soft and tight silk gown, from the collar to the large-fashioned brocade hand-embroidered lace, and her face was more tender and delicate, and the long hair was smashed into a ball. If the two dragon teeth are inserted, it will be awkward. And a few scorpions scatter and lie on the round shoulders, the extra temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard came in, the legendary mage was sitting on a deep red pure wool carpet, half-length on a mahogany coffee table, staring at one in front of him. A small balance made of magical gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of different sizes and sizes in the trays at both ends of the balance. The balance is already in a serious imbalance and the tray on the right almost touches the chassis. Su Hailun’s left hand is playing with a small and delicate weight, hesitating which side to cast. This weight is very small, smaller than any weight on the table, and it seems that there is no decisive influence on which side to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was keenly aware that the dragons and devils engraved on the pillars of the balance were faintly magical. He immediately noticed that it was a magic scale. Its balance does not depend solely on the weight of the item, but more on the magic contained in the item. Moreover, it is very sensitive to the environment, and it can sense the unpredictable elemental energy between the planes, thus changing the equilibrium state. So it can be a tool for detecting the magical quality of an item, or it can be used for divination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood quietly, not bothering. He likes this kind of tranquility very much, and also likes the thrilling charm that the legendary wizard has inadvertently revealed at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
