			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this will definitely cause the wrath of the legendary mage, whether the sacrificer is willing It is not known to bear such consequences. At least until now, there has not been a replica of Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no special place for the intensive description of the guardian of the heavenly guard, but when Richard begins to prepare a guardian of the heavenly election, he inadvertently reads it again. At the expense of investing in an intermediate sacrifice, the appearance of the guardian of the heavenly guard can be adjusted again in the next upgrade sacrifice. That is to say, if you are tired of the legendary mage, then You can change the guard of the day to the bloodthirsty Philippe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and over, Richard did not see where the meaning of this reinforcement is, but the choice of the eternal and timeless dragons is a well-known reality. And practical, since this enhancement option has appeared, it means that not only has it been used, it may be more than once, so it will be retained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha secretly shook his head, skipped this paragraph, and continued to look at the options below. The main choices of the Defenders include priests, knights, warriors, killers, There are many major categories such as mages, and each category is divided into a small number of different classes. The occupational choices of the priests are obviously more than those of other occupations. There are hundreds of different career choices, just look at each A description of the occupations takes a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s consciousness touches a choice, there will be a corresponding message, and when it touches certain options, it has a distinctly different feeling. Behind these professional options, there is a deep and deep atmosphere, and the power of time that has settled there is already rich enough to be turned into a substance. In the depths of these breaths, Richard faintly hears the call, calling He chose himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that behind these special options is the mysterious and dull domain. These special options are actually from the dark. The special champion of the domain, but the choice can not be completed in one time. After the occupation, it is necessary to extract various attribute enhancements, then various special abilities, and finally some unique characteristics, only all options are selected. Right, it will create a special guardian from the field of darkness, so even if there is Nolan support behind the scenes, it is still quite difficult to successfully select a defender of the dark field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most lacking of Richard's followers at this moment is the powerful sergeant, so he repeatedly compares back and forth between the sacred officials' choices, and is not eager to make decisions. This comparison actually has the characteristics of analysis, the characteristics of a heavenly guardian. The more detailed you are, the less likely it is to make mistakes in the choices that follow. Regardless of the attributes, abilities, or characteristics, if you make a mistake, you won't get the corresponding Guardian of the Desolation, and you will only get one more than the normal day. Choose the guardian's slightly stronger product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a test of perception, patience, and analytical ability. More specifically, it is a test of luck, and Richard’s repeated screenings compare everything that can be obtained. When the information is available, the options at hand suddenly change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option is no longer controlled by Richard, and countless words roll from the front of Richard like a waterfall, and the hundreds of options of the priests are all swept away. After that, then the tens of options of the Master class are skipped one by one, and then the thirty-something options of the Warrior class roar away. In the twinkling of an eye, they enter the Cavaliers, and when Richard thinks that the Cavaliers should also skip all of them. Suddenly one of the fierce lights, and then all other choices are all darkened and gradually disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was shocked by the fact that the result of the choice had already been made. The problem is that this choice was not made by him at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t figured out what’s going on, there’s a sudden spread of more than a dozen different wills in the sky, either deep, gloomy, or hot But the commonality is that they are extremely powerful. Richard’s soul strength is similar to these wills. It is simply the gap between rocks and mountains. These wills are extremely angry. They forcibly cross over a lot of time and space and pass their anger to them. In the consciousness of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how the wills declare their power, there is nothing to stop what happens in front of them, the options are still flipping fast, the pale golden radiance is extinguished, in the blink of an eye I chose the attributes, abilities, and characteristics. From the beginning to the end, Richard couldn’t intervene at all. Even if he couldn’t do it with his thoughts, he couldn’t read the instructions that flowed like water. It’s like there is an invisible The hand manipulated the option, and it was extremely overbearing to make a choice for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this, those powerful wills are even more angry, and their anger is slamming against Richard’s soul and will, at this time, A brand new will suddenly appeared. It is not obviously stronger than other wills, but it is obviously arrogant. When it appears, it emits a threatening low roar. Those powerful wills hesitate and eventually feel unwilling. Unwilling to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the disappearance of other wills, the newly emerged will no longer conceal itself, but instead become a hand with black cast iron knight gloves, and in front of Richard's face, a page of choice disappeared out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of the relevant items of the Guardian of the Guardian appears, the light golden brilliance lights up on one item, and then there are numerous, so that Richard is stunned. The option is dim, and all the selections are completed in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, Richard has no room to intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and angry, and the force of time at the top of his head continued to pour down. A human figure condensed by golden light gradually formed, and slowly This is a female figure, but it is not big. In Noland, there is a universal rule, that is, the larger the creature, the stronger the strength, the female champion and the guardian. The normal woman is not too much, indicating that it is not a power-type occupation, but she does not follow the route of the official department like Io and Naiyou. This is clearly a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw the power of time in the air, only to feel that the front of the sky was slightly black, this self-promoted guardian actually consumed more than one and a half top The power of time for sacrifices is still being absorbed, and the process of condensing the body has not yet completely ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, a transparent woman who shines brightly appears in front of Richard. Her whole body is made up of light, and the surface of the body flows a lot. The mysterious pattern painted by the intense white light. When she opened her eyes, Richard only felt that two new suns had risen in front of her eyes. For a time, she could not see the other except her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately blocked his eyes, rolling lava in the depths of his eyes, which adapted to the incomparably strong light, and then Richard saw that The woman made up of light reached out and grabbed the force of the time remaining in the air. Every time she grabbed the power of a large group of time, pressing it between her hands and turning it a few times, she became a piece of armor and sword. , short sword, arm shield, draped over the body, in the blink of an eye, I armed myself from the head to the foot, the last bit of time, she made a golden mask, slowly put on, blocked his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the golden mask was worn, the strong light that filled the entire altar suddenly disappeared, and the woman standing in front of Richard also had a flesh-and-blood feeling, and then burst into bursts. A very strong heartbeat sounded from her body, and the sound was loud and thundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the heartbeat, it is like the ancient Titans striking the drums, Licha has an illusion, can make this roaring heart, at least should be about the size of a dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the great heartbeat only went a few times and then went silent, then the woman moved her hands and feet, and put her hand in front of her eyes, carefully watching it for a while. When he walked to the front of Richard, a pair of deep-eyed eyes stared at Richard through the mask, and the penetrating gaze seemed to sweep out the secrets of Richard's inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha." She asked, her voice with a strange hoarseness, which made people feel uncomfortable, as if each bone There are ants crawling in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but stared at the top of the altar, where the power of time was empty, and the power of the time of the two top offerings was actually Used up, most of them condensed the body of the female knight in front of us, and the remaining half was turned into armor equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completely beyond Richard’s expectations, and even beyond the content of God’s description, a heavenly guardian needs a top sacrifice, and never I heard that the guardian of the heavens will use the grace to create armor equipment for himself. However, this horsewoman has scared away many powerful wills from the field of darkness, and directly overtook the whole process of creation of the guardian of heaven. In contrast, privately using the power of divine power to do some armor weapons is just a piece of cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down and asked, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight seems to have laughed and said, "You can call me faceless. See you in the summoning of me to this world. I can help you fight, but don't think that you are my master. I don't think that any of your orders will obey. The relationship between us can barely be called equality. Of course, my status is higher. So if you anger me, maybe I will kill. "You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless knight’s words let Richard hold on the spot and ask: “Are you not a guardian of the heavens.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the eternal and timeless dragon’s grace is not to say that the Guardian will Always loyal to creating their owners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
