			<div id="content">& Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp; <br <br /> & nbsp /> () <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; However, this time an accident from happening again, has fallen suddenly heard a large male Dover Called, even stood up straight, did not know what he thought of, what stimulation, actually refused to faintly stunned, and fiercely smashed up, Niris suddenly stunned, so Fuman opened his eyes I saw the frightened appearance of the big emperor’s big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faman’s consciousness is chaotic, and when the heart shrinks, it can’t be played anymore. It’s just like: “How can there be such a beautiful woman?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris fainted on the face, but it was shy and anger, and today things are not smooth, even the stunned people can climb up again, I don’t know let Richard see How many jokes, he did not say a word, the left hand to dial, the Fuman took a half turn, the right hand punched him on the back of his head, the Fuman once again fainted, this is extremely heavy, let Richard looked at the feeling of being a little scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swordwind City, World War I, Richard lost three costume knights and nearly one hundred knights, and the knights also died in the near-hundred ride, the first time It is said to be a heavy loss, but the result is even more brilliant. The first battle completely destroyed the core strength of the Silver Sword family, and the defense of Jianfeng City suffered a devastating loss. The gate was completely collapsed, if it was restored to its original state. Masters of craftsmen who need to go to the goblin level, if they carry out ordinary repairs, the defensive power will be reduced by at least half, and the silver sword that has been entrenched in the western border for hundreds of years is thus maimed and is on the verge of collapse and disintegration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less than a thousand knights, the frontal attack is a sturdy sword wind city. It is not easy to win. It is not only a battle but a battle. The proportion of war damage is still very small. If you consider the true identity of the battle-fighting unit of the mother-in-law, the result is even more amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two sides were killed, Nyris did not speak for a long time. After a long time, he asked: "Why don't you bring some knights, if you bring If you are on a hundred rides, the loss will not be smaller. Don't tell me that you don't have so many knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "If I bring two hundred frames, a thousand squadrons, who else will fight with me, Finnel will put down 7,000 people on the avenue to stop me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris silently for a moment, then said: "You are insidious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard laughed and patted Neris's shoulder and said, "Let them feel that there is a chance to win, they will go out of town to fight with me, although every time I will have some losses, but the other party’s loss is me. Dozens of times, so slowly grinding, it will take a long time to get rid of the opponent, so how good, really do not lose, then people will not fight with me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris carefully recalls the past battles of Richard. In the recent period, Richard often gave up the strength of absolute superiority, always bringing a lot of troops to play, and it is difficult for opponents to resist the superior forces. Temptation, choose to battle with Richard, but on the battlefield, you will find the horror of Richard's all-elegant tactics and precise command of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all people will always look at themselves in the subconscious, and underestimate the enemy, and feel that others can’t do it. So, people who have tasted Richard have been disabled and have withdrawn from the stage of history. Those who have not tasted Richard are still eager to try, and there are absolutely many such people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in Faro, there was a genius commander named Salenville who thought that he could beat Richard with three-on-one, and then he did The three-to-one battlefield on the local battlefield ended in the worst defeat of his life. The military career came to an end, and at that time, Richard was far from reaching the point where he could now form a full-fledged army at will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has thought for himself, if not fighting with Richard for many times, personally experienced the terrible command of Richard’s battle, I am afraid it will also pull thousands of knights. Then, he will rush to rush to prepare to swallow a piece of Richard. After all, his private army is much stronger than the ordinary aristocrats. Whenever he thinks of it, the four emperors are often cold sweats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swordwind City fell less than a day, and Robert and the Earl of Hiritus on the border of the Silver Sword Territory received news when they saw the battle damage In proportion, some people can't believe their eyes. This is the result that can't be pushed out on the sand table. If the Earl of Silver Sword is a well-known waste, it will not be very strong. But it is definitely not weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the remaining forces of Richard, the two old foxes began to commit crimes. I don’t know if they should be sent to the silver swords to rob them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swordwind City is flattened, it is near dawn, then the messenger of Count Fenlier at noon has arrived at Jianfeng City, seeking to see Richard, want to discuss Settlement of the armistice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Richard had just completed the takeover, arming and appeasement, and was looking for a place to take a nap. He had not had time to say hello to Neris, who had been quarreled from the sofa, and heard the report of the knight, only the big coat. The first button that had just been unlocked was buckled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris holds a pillow with a half-open half-closed, lazy and sighs that the old fox is the old fox, this face is indeed extraordinary, by time In the words, the count should still be on the road to escape, and when he saw temporary security, he sent a messenger of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the decision of Count Finlay is obviously very wise, the situation of the silver sword family is already in jeopardy, and a slight delay will lead to the invasion of other lords, then It will be the destruction of the entire family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the time of the arrival of the messenger, Richard has long anticipated that the Earl will follow the move, any qualified family leader, in the face of this situation, The first consideration is definitely not revenge, but preservation. He has long thought about the conditions. First, he will compensate for military expenses and pensions. Second, he will dispose of the Baron Cannan. The third is the right to freely pass the entire silver sword. The last is Catch the city of Maple Fire and the associated baron to give Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four conditions are in full compliance with the general guidelines of the civil war of the mainland aristocracy. From the expression of the messenger’s apparent sigh of relief, the sincerity of the Earl’s side is also full. The messenger was fully prepared and actually carried a one-time two-way remote communication magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Fenrill’s reply arrived, all three or four agreed, and the first count’s compensation price was 1.5 million gold coins. And can also be negotiated, as for the Baron Cannan, will let him take drugs to commit suicide, in order to protect the cost of Cannan's own family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finril is so refreshing, quite outrageous to Richard and Nyris, but this is also good, so Richard agreed to the truce and reconciliation, when the messenger left When I go, the time is not at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maplefire City territory was assigned to the name of Richard, in fact, the two sides formed a symbiotic relationship, Robert and Hiltus to invade the silver sword again If you take the lead, it will directly threaten the territory of Richard. Richard has reason to interfere. In addition to the pleasant scenery, Maple Fire City is equally important. It overlooks the largest road through the entire silver sword. The rush to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the messenger left, Richard let the guard prepare the griffin. His work here has already been done. It is time to go back, but the guard has just left. Richard suddenly heard a clear and high-pitched cry: "Lee, you give me out, if it is a man, then I will fight with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is very surprised. This sound sounds very clear, but the sound source is obviously from outside the city. This is the first time since the attack into the silver sword collar that someone has publicly challenged him. When did the silver sword family have such a bloody strongman? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at Richard, smiling like a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked back and forth a few steps and said with some anger: "I look so bully." The followers of his consciousness have begun to move to the city. Move at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris spread his hand and said, "God knows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Challenging Richard Obviously a woman, the voice is very penetrating, and covers the entire Jianfeng City, which can be passed to the castle, but the shouts fluctuate obviously, suddenly weak and weak, and the two people know that the challenger has just entered Sanctuary, don't say that the manipulation of power is far from home, that is, the absolute amount of power savings is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s bloody battlefield was not a big magician, the record was already brilliant, and he killed this new sanctuary at this time. The rookie is almost the same as the chopping dish. Perhaps for this reason, the position has already been in the twilight of the city gate and the tiramisu has no meaning to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice sounded again at this time: "Richard, you give me out, don't hide, you only rely on more people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a very good face at this moment. He is going to sneak out the silver sword collar. The hand is at most a thousand rides, but the silver sword is close to 50,000. The army, this is also called by the number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't hurry to go out, listen to what she has to say." Neris said with a flutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He categorically refused: "No, give her a few more noises, my reputation will be completely ruined." He already had a hunch, even if he ordered, 绯Both color and tiramisu may not be able to raise interest in solving this rash female sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard strode out, Nyris quickly chased him up: "What are you afraid of, anyway, the reputation of Archimonde is not good." And listen to it, there are not many such talents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
