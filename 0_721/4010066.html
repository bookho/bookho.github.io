			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly, Richard’s mind is floating on a new idea: this man, I will never only have such a small sky in my heart. He is sitting here, maybe not at all wanting to see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Richard tried to close his eyes, feel the surroundings, and feel the wind coming from the face. Gradually, Richard suddenly felt that he felt something, but he could not catch it for a while. He is not in a hurry, just put his heart in peace. Years of meditation have played a role in this moment, and Richard's heart gradually returns to silence, but it is not meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just sat, didn't want anything, and emptied his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heart is empty, naturally, there is a place to put on something new. How much you can hold depends entirely on how open your heart is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that he couldn’t seem to hold much, and the two future pictures were almost full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about the man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man’s heart seems to accommodate the whole world. Or, can you only put down one figure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, and Richard finally opened his eyes and spit out a sigh of relief, then sighed slightly and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood by the window and overlooked the city full of lights. Tonight, the moon of Amber hangs in the sky, and the dim moon is intertwined with the stars, showing the endless prosperity. However, after the glory, it is deeper than the night. Conspiracy, sin, extravagance, and ** are united into the glitz of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Richard was completely devoted himself to this glitz, struggling hard, thinking that he would always summit in the squally showers. However, after burying his head and climbing hard, he looked up and the peak was still out of reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man, standing on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard understands that the road is still very long. But the long way, as long as you go step by step, there will always be a time to reach the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard went downstairs, he saw the old butler standing on the stairs, apparently waiting for himself, not knowing how long he waited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler's injury is not completely good, although the magic can cure the trauma, but the bones and muscles still need to slowly recuperate, his actions are still very difficult. However, after Richard returned, he forced to get out of bed and perform all duties. At least for now, there is no sign of slack from his stand-up posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master, two guests have come to visit and have been waiting for you in the living room. One is the four emperors of the Philip, Neris, and the other One is the son of the Duke of Iron and Blood, Agamemnon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nyris and Agamemnon are coming? Strange... Ok, take me there. See them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard entered the living room, Nyris stood up and smiled and said: "This living room is really simple. You Archimonde has nine, no, ten exclusive planes. How can it be so stingy, even the living room will not be reluctant to decorate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is indeed speechless. The inevitable luxury is part of the etiquette, but Gordon obviously never valued this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak right." Agamemnon inserted a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris has to say: "Good, listen to you. Richard, I heard that there was a rebellion in your Greenson plane, Dragon Master Lina apparently I can't do this myself, or she doesn't want to get it by herself. So, you must go to the Greenson plane to be messy. The two of us came over this time, just want to go with you to the Greenson plane. "Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the Greenson plane to play a slap?" Richard's expression is very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact tells the truth that they have nothing to do with them. Although they don’t understand what they suddenly want to do, are these two war mad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is the housework of the Archimonde family..." Richard said euphemistically. He is not worried that Nyris and Agamemnon will peep into the Greenson plane. The royal family and the iron-clad family are much thicker than Archimonde. They are not lacking in the plane, but lacking people who can open up the plane. But there are many meanings to invite or say to allow members of other families to participate in private plane wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, you have helped me, this matter is even if I am still a good person. Hey, you are not doubting my fighting power? Although I I admit that I am handsomer than you, but I can play very well!" Nyris's voice is getting higher and higher, and there are signs of groaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha cried and laughed, this prince’s thinking jump, even he felt a little can’t keep up, he had to say: “Good, good! The time of departure is the day after tomorrow. At 6 o'clock in the morning, the transfer location is on the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, we will arrive on time!" See the request of Richard to participate in the war, Nyres Immediately turned into a full face of the sun, immediately took Agamemnon to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and just thought of it as a game for two big aristocratic children. Neris and Agamemnon's personal strength is indeed outstanding, and when fully armed, it is even possible to have the sacred level of combat power. But war is not a personal duel. Strong high-end force is very important, but it is not a factor that can determine everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the night was not deep enough, and Richard then came to Gordon’s war room and re-raised the situation of the Greenson plane on the magic sandbox. Holding the chin, I began to think about the battle plan repeatedly. Of course, in his deduction, Lia’s army was fully mobilized with himself and quicksand. The two accidents of Nyris and Agamemnon were not taken as the main force. It was not the distrust of their power. It is Richard who is used to relying on the power he can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so focused that he did not see the figure of Dragon Master Lina quietly passing through the door. Lina had already left the war room and stepped into her room. In this castle, Gordon prepared a private room for each knight. But she retired and stared at Richard in meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the war room is soft and dim, the magic light is sprinkled from the ceiling, and the magic sandbox shines from the bottom up. Richard Richard stood in the middle of two light sources and contemplates. The light and the shadows outline the sharp edges and corners of his face, and in the beautiful and beautiful, there is a solid calm and a hard air like a rock. And Richard's focus has smeared him a layer of vague charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Lina seems to see Gordon standing there again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before every war, Gordon always thought about every detail. This rough man is actually behind the unknown. Many miracles born from his hands are all products of full preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Lina does not think that Richard can play a role in the battle of the Greenson plane, she is more embarrassed about this beautiful Just a teenager. She already has a mature plan. Once Richard fails, she will throw down the army and use the personal force of absolute superiority to eclipse the rebels step by step until all the rebels are eliminated. As for the sacred strongman, Lina will give him a lot of damage with a full blow. Even if there is a magic tower shelter, the Dragon Master can slowly kill him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this victory, she will pay the price of having to recuperate for a while, and will also affect the speed of the plane development. However, in the current state of wind and rain, it is more important than the expansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So excuses for the rebellion of the Greenson plane need help, but Lina wants to see that it’s just that Richard’s courage is enough. Richard is still young, and there is a great future. Time is on his side. Compared with any 17-year-old peer, Richard is incredibly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, seeing what Richard is like now, Lina’s heart has an unbelievable idea. Is it true that Richard will win this war? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this teenager also become a man who can make a miracle like Gordon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows? Isn't there a miracle born in this little boy? When he was considered to have the talent of a builder, who would have thought that at his first installation conference, he would release two sets of suits in shock? At this age, his name is already juxtaposed with Lugadimo at the time of his rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, he can really win this war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina thought, unaware that time passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed quickly, and it was time to go to the Greenson plane. Master Long built a small portal in the basement of the castle, waiting for Richard, quicksand, and Nyris and Agamemnon in front of the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two world-famous young people are obviously well prepared. Both are a legendary armor, and the weapons are even stronger than the average legendary equipment. some. Not only that, but Agamemnon also has a magic box with obvious spatial attributes on his back. No one knows how much supply there is. As for Nyris, the left wrist bracelet and the two rings are also space equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their equipment is too luxurious and the preparation is too full, so that Richard stayed for a while and couldn’t help but ask: "You want to stay in the green area." How long?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Peace war, at least one or two months? Don’t worry, I prepared three months of supplies, not I myself, it is enough for us to use." Neris patted Richard's shoulder and said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was completely speechless, waiting for the portal to be good, and the first jumped in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When coming out of the other end of the portal, what Richard saw at first sight was the boundless forest. Greenson's plane, the name really looks good. The forest is endless, the dense canopy covers the sky, and the wind is full of green air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
