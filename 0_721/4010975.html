And he himself is immersed in the world of architecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time went by, three pieces of Midalun suits finally formed on the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the remaining materials and began the manufacture of the fifth-order magical armed forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the different materials used, the magical soul formed will be slightly different, so each fifth-order structure is different. For Richard, even if it is the same as the magical armed forces, every time he does it, he will always have a corresponding understanding of the rules, so his construction is making faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new magical armor uses a much stronger core material, which greatly simplifies the manufacturing structure and shortens the time required for drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon a new magical arm was completed in the hands of Richard. With three Medalun combat versions and a fifth-order magical armor, the redemption system can run for a long time, and the strong willingly continue to fight for Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the no-face plan, Richard also needs to at least create a new fifth-order structure. Like this entry-level fifth-order structure, the easiest to make, and the most practical is the illusion hidden and the king of metal. Richard originally intended to load the hand from these two structures, but when he was drawing, his magic pen suddenly could not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood quietly, thinking, thinking back from the bloody journey, all the battles until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most used on the way is not everything, but not the three worlds. The ability to overcome the indeterminacy, and to escape in the danger of the eternal vortex again and again, is actually the real power of his Saron Rivendell, and he touched the life rules of the underlying rules of the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful power of the real name makes the effect of the praying of the azure moon of the auspicious sword greatly strengthened, and the control of the rules of life makes the power of the prayer of the letter reach an incredible state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of multiple injuries, a complete prayer can make Richard close to healing. This healing power is almost equal to the highest level of magic of the legendary priest. If you must say that you have surpassed the power of prayer, you may only have the incredible resurrection ability of Nai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the power of prayer that makes Richard’s life awkward, and it’s repeatedly out of the danger of an eternal vortex, and finally succeeds in evolving. Get out of the channel into a black hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While giving a prayer to the undecided, Richard has already felt faintly, as if she could touch her soul. Not only does she clearly feel the state of her soul, but she can also feel where her soul has broken and how to fix it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Richard’s attempt failed every time. There is a little bit of jīng in the power of life that believes in prayer, which can be used to repair the soul. However, Richard’s control over the power of life is still a little worse. It is impossible to separate this life from the prayers of the letter and lead to the infinite soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, the situation was urgent, and Richard did not think much. At this moment, Richard suddenly felt a shock, thought of a possibility that he did not believe it: Could it be that this is the true face of Nai's resurrection ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this guess is true, then when Richard goes one step further in analyzing the rules of life, he can successfully mobilize that life, can it also Get the same ability as Naiyou? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, even Richard is somewhat difficult to calm down. He suddenly changed all the materials and matrices, then flew down and sketched a new magic array on a high-quality dragon skin matrix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magical array was formed, the head of Licha suddenly appeared in a full moon of azure, and then a beam of green light appeared in the palm of his hand. This is the power of faithful prayers, and then Li has floated out of countless rǔ white sè light spots, one by one into the prayer of prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Richard slowly guided this force with the rules of life, flying many deep spots from the light group, and the energy of impurities was less and less. In the end, it condensed into a diamond-like diamond! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly flashed a flash of light on the diamond, and has awakened the limited intellect under the rule of power, turning into a magical soul. Richard did not stop, immediately introduced this magical soul into the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flash of glare, a piece of palm-sized, rǔ white sè appeared in the hands of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took this new look, but it’s awesome. This dress has an extremely powerful light, but it’s not what he thought would happen. Life force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the real name, the monthly force and the rules of life are combined, it turns into pure light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed for a while and did not expect such a change. He tried to input some magic into the structure, and the result was all converted into pure light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was suddenly speechless. He originally intended to create a prayer similar to faithfulness, which would greatly increase the power of life, and bring three 虔The composition of the letter of prayer. But I did not expect the mutation to be like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new name of the building that he envisioned was a gift of life, but now it seems to be changed to a tribute to light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that he must have made a mistake. However, this is also a very common thing. The design and creation of the high-end structure is not as good as it is normal. It is not normal for Richard to accurately and accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the praise of this light, Richard couldn’t help but laugh and cry. The tribute of light can transform the magic and vindictiveness of other genus into pure light, and it can greatly enhance the power of light system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these two functions are not only useless for Richard, but also for other strong players. Light system ability is not as good as life in terms of treatment. The attack is not as good as the elemental magic. The protection aspect can only be said to be general, so there is rarely a real strong person who is willing to practice the light system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head, though disappointed, but this is a five-step structure, so he is going to throw this structure into the point redemption system. Just set a reserve price and exchange it. If anyone wants it, then take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, the alchemy communication squadron at his desk suddenly rang a sweet bird song. Richard knew that there was a waiter for advice, and that there was a considerable degree of importance that would disturb the person who was making the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A servant wizard walks into the lab and respectfully A letter was handed to Richard and then retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was written by St. Martin and used a first-level emergency logo. It is said that it is still helping Richard to find clues to the dark side of the world. But another thing has already come to fruition. The Pope agrees and sees Richard, but the place must be in front of the Temple of the Holy Glory and the Lord of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This request is not difficult for Richard, and his heart has moved, the light tribute that has just been made, is not tailored specifically for the people of the Glorious Church. ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the letter and the structure, and gave a sigh of nostalgia, and set off for Noland. From Faro to Noland, and then from Noland, all the way to the king of the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked out of the transmission, he saw that Saint Martin was already waiting for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinie snorted and said, "I know that this kind of thing is the fastest you come! Oh, sooner or later you will see you die in a woman's hand, no chest Dazhi's guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "What is your ambition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking for the ultimate in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a very, very large goal, so big that I was shocked by Richard. Especially after going through the eternal vortex, seeing the infinite vast world beyond the plane, and after many magnificent and incredible scenery, Richard understands the true meaning of the search for the ultimate sentence of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that Martin definitely knows the meaning of this sentence. It’s just that the joke of the Son is not very funny today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was originally prepared to ridicule Martin for a few words, but when he turned his head, he found that Martin was a serious face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
