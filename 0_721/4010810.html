The experience of being killed once and for all has also made her an extraordinary fighting skill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a hard-working environment in the outer world, and it erodes her body a little. It was not until she returned to Noland that she had the opportunity to start repairing the old wounds and injuries that were unclear on her body, and slowly disappeared from the law of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she didn’t hear Philip’s call, she would never return. When she left, she had chosen her final destiny and turned into a pile of bones in the outer domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know that this will be the end, you will never return. She always feels that somewhere in the void, Philip and Vatican are sitting opposite each other and looking at each other. Even if they can't do anything, they can't even talk and communicate, but as long as they can see and feel the other side, it is happiness. . .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their happiness is hell for nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing suddenly stood up, strode out of the palace, and said: "Take me to the Colosseum!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Colosseum is built in another independent half-plane, where hundreds of fierce beasts are housed, from the dragon to Bimeng. Whether it is a fierce beast fighting, or a human war, it is the favorite program of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this afternoon, the ten most fierce and most dangerous behemoths in the Royal Colosseum were all shredded by the undecided armpits, and it took less than three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple that is dangerous in the eyelids has not faded, but most of the beasts raised in the Colosseum have fallen to the ground, and Ladullah does not rise. . Those who can still move are not willing to enter the venue, or they can't afford to fall into the ground, only mourn for mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an opponent, so that the uncertainty is uninteresting, so the sleeves left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in a mysterious plane, the turbidity is standing on the back of a huge flying beast and flying forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground under the foot is rapidly retreating, even at this height, you can clearly see the dry wide riverbed, the dead ancient wood, everything is still, no Any active object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is a turbid gray, but there is still a faint light on the horizon, but there is no swaying, the whole world seems to have solidified in one of the most gloomy Twilight moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity flows hand in hand, he wears a simple travel suit, his back is straight. At this time, he faded the humility before the Queen, and there was no madness when he returned to Noland. The momentum was like a mountain, showing the strength of the strong. There was a black robe mage standing beside him, and a dozen others were busy manipulating the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a flying beast that resembles a giant worm, up to thirty meters long. It has no wings, but has two rows of floating organs in the abdomen and tail. These organs are constantly shining with the blue light, and each time they flash, they will push the flying beast forward 100 meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemy machine is placed next to many floating organs, and the manipulators use these machines to stimulate the flying beast to open or stop the floating organs, thus achieving acceleration and deceleration. Lifting and other operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These operators have a tacit understanding, although the operation is complicated, but the flight of the flying beast is quite smart. It seems that they are all trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast quickly flew to a black mountain and landed slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity jumped from the flying beast and looked up at it with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe mage also fell by the turbidity flow, saying: "It can carry fifty tons of materials at a speed of one hundred kilometers per hour. It can fly ten times after eating completely. How many hours, how, right? If this number is more, it can completely change the form of war! In addition, you also saw that our manipulation technology is mature. As long as you train more low-level mages, the quantity is not a problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity smile on the face is unchanged, can't see approval or something else. He said indifferently: "But ordinary people's wars can't decide the big picture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robe mage said: "The party that can win the ordinary people's war is not likely to suffer in the strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity thought, nodded : "There is also reason! So Master Heatings, can we look at something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings said: "Of course! Please come with me. I believe that the things that will be displayed next will definitely impress you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity still looks faint, saying: "Hopefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings made a gesture and led the turbid flow to the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity just stepped into the valley and suddenly stopped and took the foot that had already been taken back. In the place where he stepped, there was a shallow footprint. The footprint suddenly squirmed and disappeared in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground in the valley is actually soft! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings met and smiled: "From here on, it is the territory of 'her'. We are now in the 'her' Walking on the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid stream flashed a touch of fine mans, nodded, followed Heitings to the valley, leaving two behind Shallow footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how the turbidity adjusts the pace, even if it takes a few steps to float, the corresponding footprint will always appear below, the depth is the same. This turbidity finally got a little moving, and Heitings smiled confidently, apparently knowing it would. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the valley, a row of black giant towers emerged from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant towers are more than three hundred meters long and have a diameter of fifty meters. The giant tower is black and has a large and bright red or yellow stripe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid stream sighed deeply and pressed the shock of the heart and said, "Is this the nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. We can go to see it nearby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the turbidity flow is no longer reserved, but it rises directly and flies to the vicinity of the worm's nest. Carefully observe the huge creatures at the top without looking at the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings also flew to the side of the turbidity, smiling, let him examine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the nest is covered with black nails, like the shell of an insect. The turbidity reaches for a poke, but it only pokes a few centimeters deep! Although the turbidity flow does not use all the strength, but this is the 捅 steel plate is not so deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity raised his hand again, this time the faint radiance on his arm, has used the ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slamming sound, the turbid flow of the entire arm was inferior to the nail, but he had no expression, slowly pulled out his right hand. Just this record is comparable to the Sanctuary's strongest strike, but it is only able to insert the entire arm, only a few small cracks appear around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the quality of the nail is surprisingly thick, and the turbidity clearly feels that there is no end to the end of the spurt. Seeing that the blow of the previous force was dispelled, I am afraid that even his arm It is twice as long and can't be worn through this layer of nails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings explained in a timely manner: "This layer of nails is three meters thick and can withstand the legendary bombardment. Doubt. Not to mention the battle unit guardian here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity nodded, and looked up and down the nest again and suddenly landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, there are several huge pipes connected to the roots of the nest, and the other end is extended, not into the distant mountains. All the pipes are constantly squirming and creeping, making people creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid streamer waved, the palm of the hand was like a knife, and the two-meter-thick pipe had been cut into a big hole, and the thick yellow liquid spewed out. Almost immediately, a large amount of foam began to appear on the edge of the pipe, and the wall itself squirmed. The wound was slowly closed, and the foam began to solidify, sealing the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The injury recovered a bit slower." The turbidity said, and reached out and took a spout of liquid, and tasted it in his mouth, saying: " Not very fresh, nutrients are not very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heitings' face changed slightly and he returned to normal. He said: "The vitality is increasing. This is a very long process."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long is it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It still takes ten years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity nodded and said: "If we Give you what you need?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That would shorten to three years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The turbidity sinks a bit and says: "Three years, it is not too unbearable. However, is this a surprise that you want to give me? A mother nest that does not know when it will recover, some control is not This is the stable combat unit. Of course, I admit that your talent is indeed unparalleled, and it can rejuvenate a dead mother's nest. However, this is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a mother's nest, but a higher level of form, this is the mother!" Heitings said with some excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity shook his head: "No matter whether it is the mother's nest or the mother, it is not enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Tins groaned and gnawed his teeth and said, "The turbidity is big, please come with me. The surprise you need is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity follows the black Tins flew to the upper part of the worm's nest, which was roughly thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasting reached out and shot a certain part of the body, and the insects immediately bulged, and then slowly opened. Under the three-meter square elliptical insect, there is actually a compartment hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the cabin is closed with a transparent membrane filled with clear liquid, with a shaped creature lying in the middle. His head is not big, and there are dozens of dense holes in it. I don't know what it is for. He has four arms, the end is not a hand, but is divided into several soft tentacles. As for the lower body, it is covered with beetle, and there are six knots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this alien creature, the turbidity of the face immediately became serious. Even though he can still feel through the cabin, this alien creature is alive, and its tyrannical vitality makes the turbidity a bit scary. If it wakes up, the combat power should be equivalent to the human sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity narrowed his eyes and covered up all the emotions. He said, "How much is this thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings did not answer, but breathed a sigh of relief A dozen or so hatches were opened, and all of them were sleeping under the alien creatures. They are divided into several different forms, but all have one thing in common, that is, the combat power has reached the sanctuary level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to open more, the turbidity can only be seen at a glance to see the size of the similar cabin. Obviously the light is the nest, and there are at least hundreds of alien warriors hidden inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings flew a little farther and stretched his fingers to the depths of the valley. The turbidity flowed in the direction of his fingers, and I saw dozens of huge worm nests, and there were more worm nests in the clouds at the foot of the mountain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity of the gaze fell on the black mountain and stayed for a long time. He could feel the vitality of the mountain. That mountain is the mother of the successful resurrection of Heitings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity flowed to the mother, asking: "If it regains consciousness, can you control it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is just an empty shell, its soul will have long since dissipated. It can be resurrected because of the vitality of the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A pause, Hetings added: "If it has the possibility of regaining consciousness, I will never try to resurrect it. I don't think I have enough ability to control this kind of thing!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Turbidity agrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To force control of a mother, no matter who it is, that person must be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you can't control the mother, what are you going to do with these things?" Turbidity waved and waved at the alien warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatings released a alien warrior on the spot and referred it to a mage tower on the edge of the valley. There have been more than a dozen black robe wizards who have stepped out of the Master Tower and started a magical array on the ground. The alien warrior was thrown into the center of the magical array, and the magical light then wrapped it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
