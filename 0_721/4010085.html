			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, there is a bright spot in front of the legendary Master. There is the destination of her trip, Faro plane. The time-spaced crystal wall wrapped in Faro is in front of him. The legendary mage raised his hand and blasted a magical power that was incomparably pure. He made a passage in the wall of time and space and drilled into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as you enter the wall, the vision of the legendary Master changes instantly, and several continents and countless planets float in the void. But before she started looking for Richard's position, suddenly the golden light flashed, and a long gun that was condensed by the power of the hero was coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud bang, the legendary Master’s hair was flying, and he had already made a fight with the divine rifle. She flew for a while, and this stopped her retreat, and then she fired her eyes and stared at a golden light-ridden god in front of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the god is thunderous and resounds through the void: "Go back, the invaders! Faro does not welcome you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun began to appear a faint blue light in the eyes, sneered and said: "A faint divine power, dare to say such words? The abyss lord can not take me from his site Go out, do you want to try this idiot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god is very angry and growls: "Despicable life! I will tie you On the chain, burn with sacred fire for 10,000 years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This roar makes the legendary sigh helplessly, saying: "Speak this way...you Have you ever seen it out of this crystal wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment, the face of the legendary mage changed. In the void, the outlines of dozens of large and small gods emerged, and one god is gradually coming out of the kingdom of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes rounded up, sucking a sigh of coolness, only to be exclaimed: “Damn!”, it was overwhelmed by the surge of divine power. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark blue conference room, the big magic guides are discussing how to persuade the highness of the temple to transfer the transfer point to the top of the tower, a portal suddenly appears, followed by legend The mage shot from the inside like a cannonball, not only smashed the long conference table, but also broke through two floors and fell into the floor below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspeakable spurt in the portal, converges into an indescribable fire, and rushes in through the hollows of Su Hailun until it is transmitted. The door closed itself, and the divine power had to be interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Magic Guides have long since swayed, and they have inspired a variety of defensive shields in an instant, but they are on the brink of magical power! Fortunately, the power of the gods is just passing by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precision of the power of the gods is far superior to that of life, and there is almost no excess energy to dissipate. That is to say, the power of the whistling and passing by is almost overwhelmed. they. If the target is aimed at them, no matter which one, they will be completely annihilated immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horrible deep hole has appeared on the floor, and a few coughs from the legendary Master came from the bottom of the hole, and then said intermittently: "I...nothing! You guys Go on your own! Let's cure the wound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the bottom of the hole came a familiar magic wave, the legendary wizard opened the portal again, no I know where I am going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the great magisters were wounded, and they climbed up and looked at each other, and their eyes were full of sorrow. His Highness Su Hailun clearly said that he was going to visit other planes. How did he come back when he was like the kingdom of a real god? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro plane ushered in his own twilight. The story that occurs near the distant wall of the crystal wall, for most of the creatures, is that they will not intersect in their lifetime. Hundreds of millions of tens of thousands of people, still living on their own tracks, enjoying, and struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the other, Richard has already had a pivotal power in the blue water oasis, even enough to influence the movement of the entire oasis city. The narrow site has completely failed to match the strength of Richard, and expansion is imperative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard has nearly a thousand fighters, of which the humanoid primary fighters and the throwing soldiers have the same level of power as the elite Knights. In addition, led by Liusha, Iowa and Clark, plus a group of nearly 10 junior priests is enough to envy any force in the bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it’s a group of followers. They are young and promising, but the current combat effectiveness has been eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard came back, the first dinner was quite significant. It is naturally the closest relationship with him who can eat this meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of dinners has three more people. Except for the mineralist Billier, the other two Richards have never seen it. Their referees are Tiffman and Amman, each of whom is a representative of a large business group. The power behind it is at least a field count, and it is also a new force that emerged after the great turmoil of this bloody land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctuary Swordsman Luofu was put in the first place in the public. In this world of strength, he naturally felt that this would be more reasonable. However, now, Luofu feels that the position under the butt is a bit hot, which makes him sit very unsteadily. The war rifle in the close-fitting pocket made him look at Richard's eyes full of complexity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Luofu, one left and one right, sitting on the Lord of the Moon and Richard, but obviously, the real protagonist of this meal tonight is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are already familiar with Richard, such as Tiffman, Billier and Amman, know that the essence of this dinner is equivalent to a non-public Auction. Because in the hands of Richard, there will always be a variety of amazing things. And Richard has been away for so long, and it is likely to surprise everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the room couldn’t afford any interest in the fine food on the table. They ate a few mouthfuls and put down their cutlery. Richard asked the waiter to pack the dishes and smiled and said, "You, I have been spent in the teacher's half-face for the past three months..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence came out, people immediately talked about it. Richard is actually equivalent to clarifying the identity of the teacher, because only the legendary strong will have their own half-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Amman and others thought that they knew more about Richard, and of course he would not believe in him. The batch of smudged magic scrolls has revealed the identity of the person standing behind Richard. The legendary powerhouse can intervene in something between the gods, but the hand can't stretch that long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to raise his hand to calm everyone down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time I came back, carrying a batch of equipment. I don't know if everyone is interested. First let's take a look at this sword. Don't get me wrong, it's just Sample."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, Richard placed the prepared enchanted sword on the table. Just a look at it, the two deep-military sanctuary faces of the Moon Bear and Luofu have changed a bit. Then, Billier, who specializes in ore and metal business, is also moving, obviously seeing the difference in material between ordinary swords and ordinary swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enchanted sword was passed on in the hands of everyone, everyone looked very carefully. When the sword was returned to Richard, everyone’s eyes fell on Richard and waited for his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The long sword made of Lafite iron, enchanted sharp and cold effect." Richard's words verified most people's guess. The quality of these swords is sufficient to arm the core members of the Duke-level Knights, or the ranks of the Earl or even the Marquis. The double enchantment effect and the high-quality material of the long sword have not always been seen. Except for the royal or the big aristocratic weapons workshop, it is difficult to find the magician to enchant the standard weapon. Even if it is circulating in the market, it is more than ten or twenty. Put the small batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman first said: "Three thousand five hundred gold coins, how many I want." This is a very reasonable price, within the human kingdom The long sword of the same quality is about 5,000 gold coins, but here is the place to stain the blood, and Richard wants to ship a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this price is subject to it. I brought two hundred swords of magic." Richard’s words made everyone in the table happy, two hundred handles. The long sword was instantly divided. The total cost of Richard’s acquisition of Longjian from Noland is only one thousand and five. And in Noland, who has a large number of mages, this kind of enchanted sword is an uncompromising quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard sold five magic scorpions at a price of 40,000, each with sixty arrows. Then, half of the shield and the nail leaf were sold, and the total amount was 1.5 million gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sale was completed, Richard began a large purchase and purchased heavy weapons, hand shields and half-length plates that could be armed for thousands of people. This light has cost 800,000 gold coins. Then Richard ordered a lot of ore and magic materials, and the only 1.5 million gold coins that I just got had only 300,000 gold coins left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to reserve some money for spare. If someone sends Chuck or Tutu’s head, I have to pay for the bounty?" Laugh and explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reward of 300,000 gold coins? Are they two?" Although they knew that Richard and the red Cossack were dead, everyone was still shocked by the huge amount of reward. Moreover, Richard is by no means an exaggeration. As long as it is not an idiot, I will know that Richard’s entry is a pair of rushes, and I know that Richard still has 300,000 gold coins in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that many people still don’t know that they changed the amount of the reward, so they smiled and explained: “No, a head is 300,000.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sorrow in the room, and many people quieted down and began to figure out how to get their two heads together. Against the backdrop of 300,000 gold coins, even the sanctuary seems to be less difficult to kill. Even if there are people with heads and faces, they can't be publicly presented, but they can stand in the blood-stained place, and there is no one or two dark channels behind them. Even if it is not just for huge bounty, such a big sale can also close the relationship with both ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luofu suddenly felt that the wars and scrolls in his pockets became hot and hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinner is over. Luofu did not rush to go, but took Richard and asked privately: "There are more scrolls..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
