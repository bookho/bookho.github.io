			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last day of April each year, the seven-stringed Crescent of Noland They will all hang high in the night sky. It is said that this day is the moment to change the fate of a person in a year, so it is also called the day of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Day of Destiny is a festival of many countries on the mainland, and is also a common festival of numerous sub-wisdom tribes. Tribes dominated by witch festivals, such as the gnolls, snakes, and goblins, regard this day as the most important day. The strange thing is that those races that have lived in underground caves for many years, such as cave dwellings, such as fishermen and Naga, who live underwater, also attach importance to the day of fate, although some of them may be in the middle of the year. I can't see the moon again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend, on the day of fate, the gods will listen to the voices of believers, or send spokespersons, and even walk in the world with an avatar to listen The wishes of the believers. The believer will be rewarded, and the unbelievers will get nothing. But those who have crossed the plane are very clear, the legend is just a legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fate of this year, there are indeed many people whose fate has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a wonderful assault, chiseling and anti-surrounding campaign, the costume knight in the hands of Ellie finally appeared on the battlefield, with Neo and The formation of the Soram family knights began a decisive battle. Twenty-eighteen, the Soram and Neo-alleys still dominate, although the advantages are small. However, the result of the decisive battle, but Ellie 为 婕 婕 婕 构 构 构 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the battle that determines the battle. The army of Viscount Ellie is a forward with a knight, like a sharp pointed cone. The front line, tearing the line of defense cast by the steel torrents, the scars quickly deepened and expanded, and finally the entire battle was completely collapsed. The U.S. coalition forces were captured by thousands of people, and all kinds of cavalry were lost to nearly a thousand rides. Soram officially announced his withdrawal from the war, while Neo’s special envoy for peace talks was dispatched at the end of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ancient rules between the military aristocracy, and the results of the peace talks have actually been determined by the previous battles. The Marquis of Nio will lose up to one-third of the territory in exchange for peace for the next decade. And Ellie has the entire land lost by the defeated. The fruitful results of this harvest will allow her to have enough legal territory to be issued only by the will of the Holy Alliance emperor, and her title will become the Count of Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between the knights laid the ground for victory, but people talked more about the victory and defeat caused by the disparity in power. In the coming period, people will guess who the mysterious builder behind Ellie will be, at least his level should be above the decades-old Santa Cruz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the southwestern line of the Holy Alliance, Ellie will become a core topic for a long time. But on the level of the entire continent, more people are talking about Gordon, Gordon Archimonde. Gordon chose to officially enter the capital of the Holy Alliance at the noon of the day of the fate, the city of miracles on the mainland, and the floating world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the floating world has always been paved with steel and blood. Many forces will be obstructed in the dark, and even some big families are simply red/naked. / Naked directly sent people to intercept. This is the tradition of the Holy Alliance and the rule set by the first emperor. A family that does not have the ability to break through the blockade and interception is simply not qualified to stand in ukiyo-d. In the process of a family entering Faust, the attack on their territory is legal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hundred years, every guy who successfully entered the glory of Fausters is a road that is reddish with roses and blood. However, people often only remember the winners, but they have forgotten that more families have completely disappeared on this road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why Gordon’s decision made the entire continent look like is that Archimonde as a whole is already qualified to challenge FS, but Archimonde has never been united. As a patriarch, Gordon only represents himself. Moreover, Gordon rises too fast, and there is a serious lack of insight in the eyes of veteran nobles. The essence is not an empty word. On the contrary, it means a secret private plane, a mountain of wealth, a knight of formation, a well-equipped army, and a talent that can support expansion. The sum of all this is called the essence. The foundation is to rely on time, and it is accumulated in one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why upstarts are rising fast and falling fast. There is no doubt that Gordon Archimonde is a nouveau riche, and it is still a very stupid one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Gordon Archimonde, the road to Faust was not smooth. However, he did not mobilize the army from all sides in such a successful family to break through the blockade. On the contrary, he ordered all the planes including the local army to be stationed in place to prevent other families from looting. He did not even use the authority of the patriarch to ask other members of the Archimonde family to work together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Gordon Archimond embarked on the journey, he was surrounded by only his thirteen knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon on the day of fate, Gordon Archimonde appeared in front of the city of Ufad on time, and the entire Holy Alliance was shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time the Archimonde family has set foot on Faust, which means that from this day, Archimonde officially became the most prominent family on the mainland. a member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the day of fate is a special day for Richard. Because at eleven o'clock in the evening, he will be summoned by the legendary mage. He instinctively felt that this would be a very special meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls on the magnificent ice floes. On this special night, the dark blue is already lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue magical glory of the smog continues to overflow from the lines of the magnificent tower and rises. Looking from afar, it is like standing at the end of the ice floe with a magnificent and mysterious blue crystal tower. The open space around the dark blue is burning thousands of bonfires, overlooking the high-rise towers, like the stars in the night sky. People seem to feel the chilly and biting of the cold spring, gathered around the campfire, singing, dancing, drinking spirits, and enjoying the view of the dark blue light that only once a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mostly people living in the fringe area. Deep blue is the shelter they rely on for their livelihood and their spiritual pillar. This magic tower stands in the north for one day, and their pride will increase by one point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on this night of carnival, the upper layer of the dark blue is already silent. The big magisters have seen more grand celebrations, and they have long been indifferent. For them, the vast magical world has been explored, and there is no need to rely on celebrations and festivals to numb yourself and find sustenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreed time is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, the huge magic cockroach pushed open the doors of two heavy steel casts, revealing the steps that spiraled upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is still in line with the deep blue upper-level aesthetics, but the heavy steel surface has not been specially treated, bare red ochre and a weathered road Full of primitive beauty, people can't help but think of the origin of this metal, destroying the wild scenery in the depths of desperate wasteland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
