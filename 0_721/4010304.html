It’s just that Richard’s heart sighs that the maids used by the Duke’s Duke are mostly savvy, and they’re not going to be a maid. In the past, the castle was made like this by the people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the conference room, the aristocrats who talked about it immediately quieted down all their eyes. Falling on Richard but they are more afraid than anger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several murderous knights in the conference room can ensure that all nobles are honest Sitting even if it is as strong as Lord Bear, so he may have the courage to play against Richard on the battlefield, but in the space-limited indoors, the knights who are also Sanctuary are tantamount to suicide.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the expressions of the nobility, it can be seen that they still have not given up trying to reconcile with Richard in politics and negotiations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard’s gaze swept across the entire meeting room and suddenly felt a little tired and These aristocrats who play with caution are totally wasting time for the current Richard<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard’s gaze first fell on the Lord of the Moon, the Faro Sanctuary, who had strong military strength and knows how to bring troops to fight. It was originally a member of the Duke of the Wolf. It was also one of the confidant confidants when the Duke led the army to participate in the battle to destroy the invaders. He was appointed to guard the Duke's collar.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said to Lord Moon Bear: "The Lord met again and you made me very surprised and sorry. So you are from now on. It will always be a Lord in the future. If this is the case, you intend to leave the Duke’s collar and go into the embrace of another lord, then you and your lord will become my enemies”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great scorn as much as direct declaration of war.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon bear’s face is getting louder and louder, but it’s going to grow up. At this time, several knights standing in the corners of the conference room simultaneously screamed at the same time that they were not weaker than the Lord Bear’s momentum, and pressed him back to the seat<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising my hand prevented the faint words of the nobility who wanted to speak, and pressed all the voices. "I am not ready to listen to you this time. Seeing but declaring my decision, first of all, Toffler will be the next Duke of the Wolf to inherit all the rights of the Duke of the Dukes. The second Duke territory must remain intact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nobility in the conference room suddenly disappeared. However, they have not had time to express their opinions. Richard has continued to say: "I remind you again that the Duke of Toffler is already my natural ally, any provocation to the duke. Will be seen as a declaration of war against my Richard Archimonde"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are paler and Richard War<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, most of the nobles were expelled from the mountain town<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Defense Army reorganized all the officers who were inserted into the army were all deprived Position and drive out of the castle<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one officer in the anti-Toffler faction headed by the Marquis of Micaboro, who is left behind at the gate Obese military officer who has changed direction<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fat officer was appointed as the general commander of the city defense army. From then on, he can use the lord of the general to praise the fat officer. In the next few days, he will always take a look at his thigh to see if he is dreaming. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats who were driven away will not be reconciled, but whether they dare to take practical actions is another matter. Richard does not care about their movements. They only follow their own plans and steps. In the early morning, Richard said goodbye to the new sang. The Duke of Wolf, Toffler, began to travel to the Earl of Duis.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl was one of the nobles who was declared deprived of the right to blood in the land and must open the territory. The arrival of Richard was quite arrogant. The count was answered by five thousand private troops.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle lasted for more than half an hour with five hundred to five thousand Most of the time was spent on chasing the remnants of the enemy. In the first assault of the Knights of the Warriors, the army of Duis was smashed through the Earl, and the ogres, who were mixed in the knights, caught the slap. Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final battle of this battle is for the Earl's private army to die nearly two hundred prisoners, more than 4,000, only a few hundred people move fast enough to escape, most of them are dead It was the first assault of the Richards Force<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; These unlucky guys wanted to test the strength of Richard first and then decide whether to surrender their ideas. It’s not bad. After all, the number of Richards is too small. Unfortunately, people are smart enough, but luck is too bad and serious. Overestimating their own strength, they can't stand the full blow of the humanoid knight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The casualties of Richard’s men’s casualties are mostly single digits, mostly minor injuries. A ten-level ordinary humanoid knight who happened to be stabbed by the other's rifle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private army annihilated the castle and surrendered to the situation. The judgment of Count Earl of Iss: This is an unforgivable hostile act against the armed confrontation of the Earl and the Church. The title and territory of the Earl of the Hard Service will be taken to the blood-stained land, and will be inherited by the descendants of the inheritance to the Earl. In the future, will it be dismantled by three sons into three viscounts, and there is no interest in knowing about it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Count of Duis is the Viscount of Dim Obedience expresses complete obedience to Richard The will of the order then paid only the cost of losing the benefit of the blood-stained land. Then the Earl of Lorry<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Earl of Lor, I met 20,000 The aristocratic private army on the list of the Richards and some of the aristocrats attached to the royal family have united together to gather all the military preparations that can be mobilized and the five hundred people who have been inspected.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Richard pointed to the black-suppressed aristocratic private army and smiled at the followers around him: "Look at their point of interest"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The followers laughed The temperament of 20,000 to 500 is still only to illustrate the guilty conscience of these nobles. They have assembled such military power. They want to show their strength to demonstrate to Richard and solve problems at the familiar negotiation table. However, Richard did not and the nobles. The interest in the negotiations is to attack the army directly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five hundred extremely fierce warriors form an unstoppable steel torrent that directly penetrates the opponent’s front from the center and then adjusts to the battlefield. Then rushed into the enemy's battle from the chaos of the opponent, and then repeatedly broke through the coalition camp four times after the coalition finally fell into chaos and began to collapse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard However, it is impossible to chase down the number of fighters under his command. When the number of soldiers is captured, the number of disadvantages is fully revealed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the coalition has finally regrouped at the rear. At night, Lina and Mito are two big. The mentor appeared in the area of ​​the coalition barracks. The magical forces of the aristocratic army, the army of the aristocrats, and the army that had just been assembled, collapsed again. The sporadic arrows on the ground and the magic of the level difference could not pose any threat to them. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when Richard took out the Earl of Lorry from his castle that had become ruined The captives of 3,000 people became the most troublesome issue of Richard. The coalition forces really died. But the rest of the thousands are not the only ones who have escaped or become prisoners.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aristocrats of the coalition forces were captured by Richard and brought to the blood-stained place to serve their territory and wealth. Richard did not plunder but was left to the heir to the throne. Even the castle of Earl of Lor was destroyed. The Piaget’s private property was announced in the face of the count to inherit the right to inherit the count’s wife and sons. Richard also had no interest in the succession of the successor<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the war in the eyes of Richard No one on the list is willing to resist by force<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Richard led the group of the most powerful guys to the end of the trip. The goal of the Baron Okarie<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron’s territory is not small, but most of them are not rich in mountainous property but the scenery is very beautiful. It is the most famous resort in the Sequoia Kingdom. A <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
