			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not walking, holding the elf knife When the hand is loose, tightly grasp the changes of the elf's long knife. After a while, he will use this knife to carry out an unprecedented battle. At this moment, the elf knife seems to follow his breath. At the pulsation, there is a feeling of waking up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue is very grand, and the road to the top of the tower is also very long. Richard is not in a hurry, but gradually adjusts his body to the best state. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory attempt is unfavorable to Su Hailun. It seems to be better at the beginning, but the inexplicable move to drive out the dark blue, but touched Richard. The bottom line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helun is not only a teacher, but a deep blue, and therefore a half of Richard’s, no matter who wants to drive Richard out of the house, he Will not hesitate to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this battle, ignoring life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the deep blue, on the special watchtower, was too close to the arms at the beginning, looking down at the exit from the exit of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw Richard’s calm and unpredictable pace, he couldn’t help but nod his head, no matter how low the strength of Richard, only this one is calm and calm. Not much among the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacher, the worst-qualified student, is not longer than the flowers in the aristocratic greenhouse. Obviously, he has experienced countless bloody battles at such a young age, so he has already had a simple life and death. Seeing it lightly, knowing that you always have the best posture to meet the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would not disappoint this battle with him today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard’s standing, he immediately said in a very contemptuous tone: "Rookie, come on, as long as you hurt me, then I lost." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not get angry, but asked: "In the beginning, in addition to the dark blue control, you want to do something."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the mouth, there is a hint of meaningful smile: "What do I want to do if I want to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death." Richard sighed low, his body shone, his hands seemed to be lifted slowly, but he took the road to the shadows. The elf knife also pulled out countless afterimages, and crossed a clear trajectory in the air. To the chest of the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Richard’s knife, the smile of the beginning is solidified immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His figure flashed, and instantly appeared in the tens of meters, mastering this ability of almost instantaneous flash, almost at the beginning can be said to stand Invincible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf knife passed over the body of the beginning, but only a phantom shadow. The body of the beginning was already dozens of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slash of the air, Richard’s rising momentum suddenly disappeared like a tidal wave, disappeared without a trace, and suddenly sweated out. The clothes inside and outside are soaked, and if they are not supported by the incomparable will, even the people seem to be in the next moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unremarkable knife actually superimposes all of Richard’s existing cards and instantly drains all his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance in the distance is still very dignified, and the eyes are a little surprised. He slowly turns his head and looks to his shoulder, where the Master robe is Suddenly cracked, a long gap appeared, under the cloak of the robe, there was a corresponding wound on the body of the beginning, extending from the chest to the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound is very shallow, almost just a little bit of the epidermis, even the blood beads have not leaked a few drops, but the meaning of this wound is different, That means that Richard has already hurt him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first staring at his wound, he looked up for a long time and said to Richard: "You did hurt me, I can say that I have lost, but you are not I will be naive to think that I will really keep my promise and give you the dark blue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it was unexpectedly discovered that Richard was actually chanting a spell until the spell Upon completion, Richard revealed a decisive and brilliant smile and said, "Of course not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, the brow was slightly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His accomplishments in magic have reached the legendary realm, and naturally he knows what the spell of Richard is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the ninth time stop, nor the most haunted death finger, but only the eight-level shadow call, but the Richard's spell is extraordinarily longer, and seems to add some meanings that are difficult to understand. But how to change it, it is indeed a shadow call, this is definitely not wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight levels of shadow summoning, even if you call out more powerful shadow creatures, for the beginning, it is just the power of sighing to destroy, Li How can I release such a magic when I look at a decisive death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the beginning, it was not taken lightly. Richard’s just a knife was too unexpected. He felt that the opponent’s blade was an attack launched through the law, even if the law was extremely basic and It is superficial, otherwise it is impossible to lock in one's position by using the level and magic of Richard's level and even the external force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an incredible result for a student whose qualifications are only excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I can feel my heart is jumping faster and faster, and there are more signs that the heart will start. It is a great danger. omen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of magic emanate from Richard, gathered in the air into a thick shadow, sketching a portal image, however, the portal It is incomparably tall, simple and majestic. The shadows are rich and substantial. The frame of the portal is engraved with complicated lines, and there are more lines of runes with unknown meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portal has just appeared, the temperature has suddenly dropped, and the heavens and the earth are quiet and surprising. Before the first time across the void, the boiling ocean It is also a quiet, it seems that it has lost its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is majesty, that is oppression, that is the fear of letting all beings shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gaze of the beginning, the portal has slowly opened, and behind the door is a deep nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the electro-optical fire was on fire, the meaning of the runes on the portal was found in the vast amount of knowledge and memory at the beginning, and it was awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha, stop, it is the Shadow Corps," cried out at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Richard gasped, looking at the beginning, but the look was surprisingly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal seems to be slow and fast, and the effort in two sentences has already been opened halfway. The void behind the door is so deep that people can’t speak uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the hands were quickly closed, and the palm of the hand condensed a little milky white light, and angered: "You crazy." His hands flashed, and the white light was Unpredictable speed to the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the portal is like having its own life and will, and there is a huge to incredible existence that is slowly coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal rotates at an angle, squirting a faint shadow, greet a little white light from the beginning, and wrap it in an instant, the group White light is struggling in the shadows, and every inch of the line will kill a lot of shadows, but the shadows are endless, endless, but the white light is rapidly shrinking, and the eyes will not be touched. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, his face changed greatly. Before he had any movements, he saw a shock from the portal. He suddenly squirted a large group of shadows, and there were countless strange things in it. The number of creatures is literally hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow creatures rush out of the portal like a flood of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Super Legion, your uncle." The voice of the beginning became very dry, and he curled up and shrunk into a ball, and the body surface began. With a faint milky white flame, the power began to climb wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless shadow creatures splitting from the shadows of the big group. The moment they are formed, they are attracted by the strong atmosphere of the beginning, one by one, like a frenzy It rushed at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the portal, Richard is already exhausted, relying on the elf knife to support the standing, he is still waiting to die, but all The shadow creatures are attracted by the huge and unparalleled power of the beginning. No one has to come to visit Richard. Even if a shadow creature comes over and shoots a claw, you can take Richard's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is only a temporary ease. When the Shadow Legion destroys the beginning, it will inevitably notice the Richard on the side, swallow him in, and then scatter it. Open and harvest all life on the way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
