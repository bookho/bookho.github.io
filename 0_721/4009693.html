			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autumn is like winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early autumn of the ice floe bay is already very cold, and the late autumn is no different from the harsh winter. It can only distinguish a little different from the bright colors that have not yet come to the vegetation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole autumn, Richard is like a long-lost volcanic spurt, suddenly bursting out of tremendous energy, learning the madness of cultivation and the thirst for knowledge to make it The big magisters who were surprised at the summer speed were shocked again. It is almost impossible for them to believe that one can squeeze their own time, and all of this, but it does appear in the small body of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li has not left any room for thinking in the adjusted schedule, and the use of time has been accurate to the minute and second. When he was tired every day, he immediately emptied his brain, fell on the bed, went to sleep, and even the most basic vigilance developed in the mountains was relieved. Only in this way, Richard will get the deepest sleep, in order to recover the energy needed for one day of study within three hours, and to make the magic growth in three hours of sleep less than the three hours of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A report flies to black gold like a snowflake, letting the gray dwarf violently thunder. He tried his best to compress the number of the legendary Master's desk, so as to avoid the excessive joy of Su Hailun's Highness, which has already seemed to be somewhat fragile. However, the power of the gray dwarf is sometimes poor, and the blowout-like record flies in every corner of the dark blue. Even many reports have enough energy to cross him directly and send it to Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the deep blue balance of payments began to falter. Fortunately, the Duke of Soram did not know why he suddenly made a large sponsorship fee, while another self-funded disciple qualification was auctioned in the Millennium Empire, one of the three major human kingdoms, to add a price to the deep blue autumn and winter financial report. Two big fig leafs. However, the gray dwarf is not a short-sighted race. Black gold has a long-term strategic vision. In the past, he often worried about the financial situation of the dark blue three hundred years later. The real situation in front of us is that it does not need three hundred years, and it will not last until next spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf squats day by day, and the thick and sturdy body miraculously reveals a glimpse of the skin, and the coat that obviously does not fit with him every time The fist curse flutters like the fragile balance on the book. He deals with massive numbers every day, but income is stable, and spending is always difficult to measure, and it doesn't make people happy every time they exceed expectations. Every piece of profit is eroded, and Black Gold feels that a piece of meat on his body has been smashed. However, the joy of the legendary mage is also not diverted by the will of the gray dwarf. Sometimes she even cheers for a small achievement of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this fall, the only person in the dark blue who does not want to see "the joy of Su Hailun" is the gray dwarf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the most helpless, the Grey Dwarf even played the idea of ​​Su Hailun's personal wallet. As long as His Royal Highness opens his own purse, even a small corner, the dark blue situation will be solved. Black Gold was once fascinated by this idea. His exquisite little wallet, which is loaded with it, does not know how many dragons are wealthy! Fortunately, he soon woke up and understood how stupid the idea was. Even the dragon didn't dare to play the idea of ​​Su Helun's wallet, let alone a little gray dwarf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Black Gold was not scared, he quickly found his own motivation. If you can't solve the dilemma at the moment, what about him? The finance officer can be more than just a bookkeeping, that is what the high elves will do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf is squatting, but Richard, who is equally gloomy, is just the opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the last day of the late autumn, Richard ** stood in front of the floor mirror and carefully looked at himself in the mirror. This is a male body with a broad male style, with wide shoulders, two pectoral muscles with initial shape, a waistline that is quickly converge, a strong buttocks, and even a long, elf-like style with explosive power. And his face has a slight change, perhaps because of the long time no laughter, perhaps the reason for long-term silent thinking, the childishness and softness left in the spring have all faded, and the edges and corners began to stand out, like a giant axe Out of the steel rock, each line is buried with flowing magma. As for the eyes, they are so quiet, sullen, cold, and bottomless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard, he moved his mind a little and then looked at his lower body. The male characteristics there are already standing tall and standing, ready to penetrate and conquer, but now it is already extraordinary, there will be more room for growth in the future. Seeing the murderous weapon, Richard’s mouth finally showed a long-lost smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are already a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, Irene’s crisp and heavy voice suddenly sounded in Richard’s ear: “Yes, it was last night.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha body trembled immediately. He raised his hands to cover his ears, but he lifted it in half, because he knew that no matter how hard he tried, the conversation would be repeated completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need money."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want to make your money."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer looks at himself in the environment, but relies on that conversation to resound in the ear, stride Go to the magic lab. A steel doll was erected in the corner of the laboratory. Originally used to test the power of magic, it was now used by Richard to sharpen his fists. Whenever his heart is burned by the past, he will strengthen his power and torture himself. This is also true this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the steel doll, Li sat in the usual practice, the distance between the legs and the shoulder width, and the posture of the punch was completed without any delay. Take a deep breath. The surface of the steel doll is very smooth and clearly reflects the face of Richard. I don't know why, when I saw myself on the steel armor, Richard suddenly had an unstoppable anger! He hated himself and hated why he didn't find Eileen's embarrassment early, but indulged his own loss and unacceptable results in silence. The anger ignited the hidden blood, and the flowing blood instantly boiled and burned, turning into a roaring lava that rushed to the top of the head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning blood suddenly gave Richard the infinite power, every blood vessel wants to split under pressure, and each meridian seems to be broken in the next moment, he sends out A wild beast like a beast, throwing a punch and kneeling on the chest of the iron man doll! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forged chest of stainless steel should collapse and sag, even faint cracks. Not only the fist, but the small half forearm of Richard did not enter the chest of the doll. The power of the violent force was too strong, and a vortex with suction was formed faintly. The doll was sucked tightly on the top of the box, and the scope of the deformation was still expanding. In the end, when the power of the burst was all vented, the distorted doll flew backwards, hitting the wall and deforming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a standard magical figure with a defensive power comparable to a military-style half body armor. This means that the power of Richard's fist is enough to kill an elite knight wearing a half-length steel armor. If the energy level is used, it is equivalent to a weakened fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the day of the fall into the winter, Richard awakened the first blood of life: the outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is also like winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is a season of chilling for every native life of this plane, even if it is accustomed to living in the cold, it will prefer spring And summer. Because in the two seasons they can find more food, can mate, can breed, can store fat for late autumn and cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season is no different for Richard. The chick that had been curiously looked at the outside world closed its eyes completely and sealed off the senses. Richard did not care about anything in the outside world, but madly put himself into the world of magic. His magic grew wild again, and in the frozen season of the ice floes, Richard's magic reached 24, which has exceeded the standard of the third-level Master. Almost all the instructors who taught Richard were ecstatic about his progress, with the exception of one person, the master who taught him art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paintings that Li has handed over, one more than one makes the master feel suffocated. They are all plain-colored, all drawn by a thin feather pen. At the beginning, the picture also pays attention to composition and light and shadow, and there are also various kinds of characters. According to the master's teaching, the portrait will give the soul of the picture. However, the paintings that Li has handed in are appearing less and less, and the environment is becoming more and more oppressive. Later, there will be no more creatures in the picture, and even the scenery will gradually blur. But in the eyes of the masters, these paintings are more powerful than one, like the sea in the dark night. There are only a few waves on the sea, and the storm will come at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masters sometimes can't help but look at the lines. Every time the lines are outlined, twisted, and smooth, he seems to hear the cry of the soul from the depths of hell! Even a line is so powerful! The master can't imagine what Richard should look like when painting. One day, it was only the master of the 12th-level magician. Suddenly I realized that I had some unbearable mental impact from those paintings. However, as a mentor, he had to seriously examine each painting that Richard had handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paintings of Richard, the use of light is getting less and less, the scenery is getting more and more blurred, and the shadows of large pieces begin to occupy a larger area. Finally, one day, when Richard handed in a ‘painting’ made up of messy lines, the master suddenly smashed everything in the studio that could be smashed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the winter, there are two small things that have disturbed Richard’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that in a course, Richard once again met a young mage who claimed to be Stevenson. The young mage was very enthusiastic, and the temperament was blameless. It fully demonstrated the etiquette of the aristocratic children. The identity of Su Hailun’s pro-disciplinary disciple made him and Licha a natural barrier. Another student of the legendary mage, Minnie, was also present. She was so cold and cold at the moment that she was a lot more lively. After listening for a while, she not only took the initiative but also started a few topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether Stevenson or Minnie, they have a good accomplishment in magic, so they are talking about magic. Although Richard did not want to talk to anyone, the discussion on magic was an exception, so it was difficult for them to talk with them for a little while, so the course soon began, and Richard was able to return to the loneliness of loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
