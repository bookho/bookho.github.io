			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead is long and long, it seems that there is never an end, Richard is In the consciousness, the mother's nest was communicated. After a moment, the response of the mother's nest finally came. It simply said that the star was lost in the depths of the clouds. Now the star is just a simple means of transportation. Its intelligence level is very high. Inferior, do not have much analytical ability, and are unable to get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I have sent three brains and are flying at full speed. It is expected that I will arrive near Black Valley in ten hours. Let the star come out of the fog, and I also sent two hundred lightning feather snakes to come with the brain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I can definitely Persevere to ten hours." Richard's heart was set and continued to move forward, but he did not think of one step, the surrounding scenery suddenly changed, and the connection with the mother's nest was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of Richard, there is a ridiculous world, the sky is the deep night, the foot is the land that is not in the grass, the front is a hill, on the top of the mountain Built an old castle, and around the castle, there is a large horror cemetery. Richard did not move forward, but looked back, behind it was an empty wilderness, no longer a sight, all The people who followed have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...the half-plane." Richard was surprised, then sighed angrily and said to himself: "There are so many half The shadow of the plane, of course, there will be a half-plane, I should have thought that this guy will use the half-plane as a trap."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at the ten fingers and pick up the fate of the twins. They walked to the abandoned castle in the distance. They were lost in the half-face. It was naturally dangerous. Richard’s surface was quiet, and he actually started the real name. In the depths of the soul, The star of the star quietly emerged, the starburst of the wellhead surging for a moment, suddenly shocked, spurting a magical blue star force, slowly added to the magic of Richard, Richard immediately set his mind, which shows the stars The rule on which the well is based is far above this semi-planet, which communicates the plane, and the ability to transform energy has not been blocked by the half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I feel the threat of Richard, the night of the whole half-face is thicker, the wind begins to be strong, and the kind of crying becomes nothing. Very clear, people can not only hear the horror, but also flustered, but Richard is unmoved, striding to the castle, no matter what ambush in this half-plane, the center should be in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard set foot on the way up the mountain, it was equivalent to stepping into the cemetery. In the night, a white palm was suddenly found in the land next to it, and then a carrion was struggling from the soil. Climb out, swaying toward Richard, with the first one, naturally there will be a second, third, in the blink of an eye, almost every grave in the cemetery will find out one or even several Hands, there will be zombies crawling out from inside, looking at them, these zombies do not count thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an intensive zombie ocean with a few particularly tall generals, these undead creatures of up to 16th level, generally met by the Faroese There will be a lot of headaches. Although the zombies are not high in level, but they are too many, and anyone suddenly enters a completely strange plane. It will inevitably panic, and it will be unclear whether the place where they are is real or illusory. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-face, relying on the massive undead in the cemetery, can live and kill a common town of Faro, but unfortunately, it Trapped by Richard, a great magister from Noland’s plane, where the war of position is part of his life, Richard knew at first glance that this is a real world, and in the form of a semi-planet Exist, so it can never be too big. If it is too big, even the legendary mage can hardly maintain its consumption. The other half of the plane should see the void, not the deep night in front of it, indicating that this trap is arranged. In order to make the environment more realistic, people set up an enchantment that can wrap the entire half-plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a zombie coming to himself, Richard speeded up and greeted a zombie, a zombie screaming and holding up a double Arm, but it hasn't collapsed yet, and Richard has already accelerated, skimming from the side of it and continuing to the castle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zombie’s double fists slammed on the ground, except for a piece of gravel and dirt, and did not catch a piece of clothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked all the way up, the speed was getting faster and faster, and later he started the magical armor, he ran like the wind, no matter how heavy the zombies, Still a tall general, he couldn't catch up with him, let alone hit him. Richard often rushed over when the zombies had just raised their fists. When they clenched their fists, Richard was already far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not believe that the cemetery will be so simple, if this is the case, then an agile thief and assassin will regard this as a free place to come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, a few black shadows suddenly appeared under the night, such as lightning strikes to Li, Licha sneer, holding the fate of the twins, the left hand gently flicked, dozens of small lightning bolts popped from the fingertips, flying After more than ten meters in the air, suddenly turned into a finger-thickness lightning, hitting those black shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the lightning that Li’s blasting is no longer red, but a little white with a little bit of stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadows of those attacks are certainly not faster than the real lightning. Before these milky white lightnings, they are obviously very fragile, and they are struck by lightning. In the middle, the sorrows of the screams are falling from the sky. They are all half-meter-sized spider monsters. The backs are all shards of the stars. The eight feet are roots up to two meters. No wonder the speed is so. Fast, the corpse spider, was originally quite fierce and half undead, but after being hit by the tiny lightning bolts, the whole body burned a gray flame, and in a blink of an eye it turned into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is quite the power of accidental lightning. After analyzing some rules of the tree of life, he is now able to attach life force to some refined magic. Here, there are dead souls everywhere. Richard is only adding a little life force to the lightning in the thought of trying it. I didn’t expect to kill the corpse spider in a single blow, and attached life to the corpse spider. The power of lightning has been doubled at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse spider was killed, and Richard went straight to the castle, and suddenly a large group of vampire bats flew over the castle, and he rushed to Li Attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, dealing with the big magician, especially the great magician who has the magical reincarnation, this kind of fragile life is completely a dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing differently, and the fate of the twins has already laid a large cloud in the air, and the acid mist has become extremely large in his hands. However, the power has been reduced to a minimum. It is a large white fog. The vampire bats in the air are thrown into the clouds like rain, but they can't find the whereabouts of Richard, and the zombies, scorpions and scorpions who are coming after the rear. The foremost also rushed into the clouds. Under the cover of the clouds, these undead creatures did not see dozens of large and small fireballs that Richard quickly shot. These fireballs floated quietly, forming a The mysterious formation, then Richard gave himself a magical shield up to seven orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball exploded at almost the same time, the rushing fire waves collided with each other, and there was no way to go, suddenly turned into a wild whirlwind, but the top exploded Instead, the fireball pressed the whirlwind into the interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
