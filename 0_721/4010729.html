			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the passage, Richard immediately turned around and faced the passage God's alert, followers also put away a casual look, waiting for them, they are all informed by Richard, knowing that the underground is now full of powerful shadow creatures, waiting for them is likely to be a hard fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at God and he was aware that the shadow portal should be completely destroyed by himself, but before that, the portal was still open for a few seconds. In a few seconds, enough to rush out thousands of powerful shadow warriors, there may be warfare that is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know that there is a whole shadow army that has been quietly ambushing on the other side of the portal, Richard said that nothing will open the portal, but will choose other ways. To deal with Rios and Hill, but now it is too late, even Richard himself does not know how many shadow soldiers in the underground space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole mountain is shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently pulled out the moonlight and stood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color of the moonlight has become a little dim, not as light as before, but rather a bit more like the smell of mountains, the moonlight has been with the iron The king's iron guns were put together. This elf long knife actually absorbed the essence of the iron gun slowly. After a few days, the iron gun had been lightly halved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking some of the essence of the iron gun, the attributes of the elf long knife finally changed, and the super sharp edge went back to the next level and became the legendary sharp Now, the moonlight can almost put all the epic level weapons in two paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another abomination slaughter is still sleeping in the shackles, and I don’t know what new power will be gained after fully absorbing the silver sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looks dignified, the vibration of the mountain is enough to explain the intensity of the battle in the mountain, and even Zonghu has put away a cynical smile, becoming serious and solemn. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the battle in the mountain is still fierce, there are more than a dozen shadow fighters rushing out of the passage, and Richard doesn’t want to, the moonlight lightning With a few clicks, most of the shadow warriors were stopped, and only three were missed for the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these shadow warriors has strengths of sixteen or seven, and there is no entity, which is not good to deal with, but the moonlight is accompanied by the breath of nature and life, but it is the nemesis of the shadow creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also learned a lot of life rules in the Greenson plane, so the knife is drawn out, the moonlight blade reveals a pale white light, moonlight As soon as you cross the shadow of the warrior's body, they will be cut like a cloth, and the broken flame will continue to burn with a milky white flame, and the shadow warrior will be completely burned out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Splash also ushered in a shadow warrior, the eternal sleeper instantly cut it into more than ten paragraphs, but this shadow warrior squirmed a few times, actually combined As one, only the strength has dropped by two levels. The water is not initiated, the long knife is like electricity, and it instantly smashes out dozens of times. The shadow warrior is cut into irregular pieces and flutters in vain for a while. Re-condensed into one, after all, was completely killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a three-pointed roar next to him. He waved ten tons and smashed the shadow warrior's weapon, but he couldn't help but the shadow warrior's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many magic attributes attached to the ten tons. Its biggest feature is that it is strong and heavy, but for the shadow warrior without entity, the power of ten tons However, it was weakened by most of them. In the end, Tiramisu shot an arcane arrow and it was the result of the shadow warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shadow warrior has just been wiped out, and more shadow warriors are emerging from the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow warriors, though not physically, can’t walk through the material at will, and when they enter the main material world, they can only penetrate very limited specific inorganic obstacles. In the past few days, Richard has let the worker bees secrete a special substance that penetrates into the cave wall. This kind of material can play a special blocking effect on the shadow creatures, so that most shadow warriors cannot sneak into the cave wall. Going in, and that was originally one of the most important talents of the shadow creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures were originally designed to make the cages of the underground altars stronger, and the shadow creatures have nowhere to go, and they will attack Rios and Greece madly. Er, now the cautiousness of Richard’s original layout has finally played a role, so that the shadow creatures have to act along the channel, and when they rush out, they will face the siege. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain is constantly shaking, and the shadow creatures are constantly coming out of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, Richard was able to intercept most of it, and then intercepted half of it. Later, it became a shadow warrior that could only intercept less than 30%. The moonlight showed amazing killing power to the shadow creature, but the shadow creature was too much, Richard The most powerful genie martial arts "ring of fate" can only block more than a dozen shadow warriors at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of shadow warriors is large, but they can only come out from the mouth of the passage. Even if they play a racial advantage, they almost charge each other in layers, but they can finally Limited, can only accommodate up to a dozen Shadow Warriors to fight together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were first hit hard by Richard, and then they hit the second line of defense of the followers. After paying a heavy price, there were Construct a third line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of shadow warriors emerged from the passage, another dial was destroyed, until the crowds were about to numb, the mountain suddenly stopped shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, hundreds of shadow warriors emerged from the cave like black frenzy, but in the end it fell on the followers’ fire, this wave In the attack, more than half of the followers were injured and the construction knights also suffered casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waited for another ten minutes before he was sure that all the shadow creatures had been cleaned up, but he still dared not care about it and led the followers slowly. Walk into the channel and start viewing the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage was still the way when Richard quit, but when Richard walked out of the other side and entered the altar hall, he was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire altar hall has been completely destroyed, and it does not look like it is. It is full of traces of powerful attacks. The majestic altar has been thoroughly Turning into ruins, on the ground floor of the hall, there are dozens of wreckage of steel shackles. These magic creatures summoned are full of scrolls and scars. They are actually besieged by the shadow soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the front of a steel scorpion and carefully looked at the wound on the scorpion. The steel scorpion was deeper than a dozen centimeters. Huge wounds, these are the masterpieces left by the Shadow Warriors. The Shadow Warriors themselves are not physical, but the shadow weapons they hold in their hands are powerful, and the weapons themselves are biologically transformed into shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly wound of this steel was on the chest. There was a particularly deep wound there. It seemed to be caused by a dozen or so attacks. The last blow went deep into the steel body and destroyed its core accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei reached out and touched the floating soil on the ground to find a dark black prismatic crystal, shadow drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shadow diamond is quite advanced, that is, Richard rarely sees this grade of shadow drill, it seems that the shadow of this shadow diamond is left after death. Warrior, I am afraid that he is a captain and other characters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and looked around the hall. These shadow warriors appeared quite high-order. Under the rubble, I thought there would be a lot of shadow drills. A lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shadow drill is a key item in the advancement of the star, in the war, the role of the star is becoming more and more huge, and the extreme attention to the supply of Richard, now It is inseparable from the stars, but the demand for shadow diamonds is also extremely large. If you want to make it a new step, you need at least 500 shadow diamonds. Richard has not accumulated more than 200 in the past. This time, there is hope that it will make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Zonghu’s voice sounded: “Master, there is a passage here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Channel, Richard was shocked, he can't remember what channel there is, in the original coverage detection of thousands of worker bees, any channel is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha flew directly to Zonghu and saw that he was holding the strange wall in his hand and smashing the wall in front of him, and broke a huge gap in a few times. There is a long passage in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful observation, Richard found that there were traces of fierce battles everywhere in the passage, and the strength of Rios and Hill remained on the walls of the cave, entering the passage. Not far away, Richard picked up two high-end shadow drills, and looked at it, at least seven or eight shadow drills shining on the ground and the walls, which shows the fierce battle in the passage. Zonghu said: "Master, it seems that Rios and Hill are trying to escape, and they have forcibly cut out a channel at the cost, and want to escape from this dead land, but Although they sealed the passage, they did not block these shadow creatures. I can't see how far they can escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
