			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Richard’s confusion, Phil indulged for a long time and said: "When the Highness had not yet reached the Magister, I was at the side of His Royal Highness, and then I watched the Highness and the Grey Dwarfs, the Orcs, and the Orcs killing the bloody battles. When the Highness was in battle, the pressure was so powerful that it was unimaginable. At the point where the combat power is far from being rated, it can only be attributed to the powerful blood power. Later, when His Royal Highness officially promoted to the Great Magister, he awakened a ability that has never been recorded in Noland. It is called the magic furnace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic furnace." Richard has never heard of this ability, and with his memory ability, it seems that it has never been in dark blue. I have seen any records in a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair’s cherished color, I can see that the scene of the past made him remember: “His Royal Highness has simply told us about the use of the magic furnace. It is to expand her own magic capacity, roughly expanding by a factor of about one. I still remember that His Highness was very angry and awakened to such a useless ability. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to say this thing afterwards. Said, can't afford to lose that person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of Richard and Black Gold are wonderful, Black Gold is still better, he knows these past events, but until Now, when you listen to it again, it is still difficult to control yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic furnace, to put it simply, is to double the amount of magic that a magician can cast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for Richard to control his excitement. At this time, Phil solemnly said: “The advice I can provide is that since there is deep blue meditation, don’t I am eager to promote the big magician, first think of ways to temper my blood, the stronger the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hone." Richard noticed the Philippines I used an unusual vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, tempering, the awakening of ability and the environment in which it was at that time also have a close relationship. His Royal Highness chose to establish dark blue in such a sinister place. I am honing myself to awaken strong abilities, and the subsequent students of His Royal Highness, like the Highness, are not eager to advance to the ranks, but constantly hone themselves to awaken more powerful abilities," Phil said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard frowned, which made him difficult to decide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, this is still the choice between the two types of the main and the strong, if Richard chooses to quickly upgrade the level and develop the potential of the construction, You can quickly accumulate wealth and the army, get more sacrifices, and gain powerful blood power through sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers that long list of more than one powerful ability can be obtained through the grace of God, although there is no magic furnace Powerful to metamorphosis, but any one is a powerful ability to satisfy Richard once he is awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiled, then explained a little about the dilemma he was facing now, which made Phil frown, and he couldn’t give any better advice. In the past, the most contacted individuals were individual strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me think about it again." In the end, Richard decided to give himself some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Richard talked with Black Gold for a while, mainly asking about the operation and financial situation of Deep Blue, and then he left before leaving. A small box containing thirty high-purity magic crystals, this money, together with the various kinds of financial support provided by Richard, is enough to make dark blue support this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing so many magic crystals, Black Gold is serious, saying: "Lee, I have some understanding of your current state. Deep blue is not yet Need so much money, you should use this money and put it into the battlefield. This is a long-term solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled, Said: "Black Gold Master, you should not underestimate my ability to make money, and, Deep Blue is also my home, when the teacher is asleep, I will take full responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rich, you...hey." Black gold finally had a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Master Black Gold, I still need you to do me a favor, this time for me to find some young magicians who have potential in construction. As long as there is a level that can draw the first-order structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Black gold nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I am gone, Master Black Gold, take care." Richard bent down and gave the gray dwarf a heavy hug. He stepped on the already-developed Wyvern, and greeted the morning light and went all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard flew over the land of Noland, there was another storm in the field of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has previously published a list of family rebellion branches, which are confirmed to have robbed the sacrifices, and did not express guilty pleadings within the time limit he stated. The family, the list is not long, but it is not too short. The event has always been eye-catching in Archimonde, and it involves many families who have sheltered these Akmon branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the announcement of the list, Richard left Faust, and no one thought that Ellie suddenly sent troops from the territory and directly leveled four or five nearby Akmen. De small branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These branches are all sheltered by the Marquis of Sauron, so after receiving the news, Marquis Soron was immediately furious, but in addition to a series of anger accused Ellie In addition to the announcement by Li and Richard, the Marquis did not have any major moves, and the army in the territory was frequently mobilized, but they were all strengthening their defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the steel hall of the Marquis, Suya and he had another new dispute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, if we stand by, it will make all the lords who are attached to us chilling, who will trust us in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis did not get angry, but faintly asked: "What action should we take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining lords on the list of Richards, as for those who have been arrested by Alize, will be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good idea, but if Ellie婕 Continue to arrest the lords you want to protect.” asked the Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That’s a fight with her.” Suya gnawed her teeth, and the risk of launching a war with Ellie was great. She and Richard’s style were completely different. Richard can use the force to the extreme on the battlefield, and Ellie is that people don't even know when she will call, where the military is pointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Soren nodded and said, "The courage is commendable. However, you think there will be a lot of knights in the presence of Ellie."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to thirty." Suya did not want to say, but he had worked hard to understand Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are many builders in Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis’ words made Suya wake up, Immediately came out with a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard led a hundred and fifty costume knights to regain the symbol of the Archimonde family, the Black Rose Castle, you can sway in front of Suya At that time, Suya was almost mad and mad, trying to launch a death strike against Richard, but was blocked by the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha and Ellie are now partners and allies, and Richard’s costume knight can also be regarded as the costume knight of Elliott in some sense. So how can she have only 30 knights in her hand? In the hands of a famous player like Ellie, the knights tend to exert amazing power. When they think of her hidden knights, there may be fifty. Even more, even Suya lost some fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a brief and cold silence in the steel hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya finally said bitterly: "Father, Richard’s speed of development has also been seen, we... If we don’t stop him at this time, in the future There is no chance anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sauron was silent for a long time, and finally only heard a slight unspeakable sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s actions made all the Akmon branches that had been involved in the floating islands shudder, but what made them chilling was Marquis's attitude, Marquis was yelling and did not have any practical action, which made them understand that this big tree is actually not enough to enjoy the cold, and it is even more impossible to cover the wind and cover the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Richard returned to the floating world from the dark blue, he barely rested, he rushed to the black rose castle, where Richard has three thousand just Armed knights armed with sophisticated equipment, there are two hundred candidate knights, and a full hundred knights and more than two elite knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a group of wolf tigers and leopards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Richard came to after the Black Rose Castle was to put all the beasts out, he personally led the team to go out and start one by one. Sweeping the Archimonde branch that refuses to confess and return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
