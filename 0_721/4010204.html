			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water and ochre mixed in the Raptor, each turned to a night leopard The elder Druid touched it. The two elders suddenly became stunned, and their tails and back hairs were all erected. Druid’s keen perception was not empty talk, they immediately found the scarcity of water and twilight. There is a difference between them, the water is only scary, but the twilight makes them hate from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to flip the book of carrying, and it was a chain of lightning, once again knocking down the elf elders who had stubbornly climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn actually rushed to a Druid turned into a night leopard, and it slammed down, and the unicorn penetrated deeply into the elder Druid. Waist! The elder Druid snorted and turned back to bite the shoulder of the unicorn. A pair of front paws grabbed ten blood marks on the unicorn. The unicorn screamed, and the power of the scorpion broke out in an instant. He slammed his head and knocked the elder Druid out of the tree top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn gave a scream of victory, and the unicorn glowed, and a sacred glow flashed through it, and the scars disappeared without a trace. Even Richard is a bit stunned. He still doesn't know that this beautiful and pure creature of the unicorn can be so flesh/blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, the sand is gently let go, and the leopard has been flashed overnight, then the night neck of the night leopard is carried, and it is thrown away. Throw it outside the tree top platform. It was also a fallen Druid elder, and a bad guy who underestimated the war and the gods fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Druids were chased by the splashes of water and the sorrows, and they looked at the night leopard that was forced to the corner, and the twilight was so excited. Blurred, sticking out the scarlet tongue and rubbing his lips. Seeing the twilight expression, the elder Druid screamed, and turned around, actually jumped from the platform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden change, let the twilight also stay for one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the water is smashing and killing. The concentration of the girl’s battle is collapsing, and the night leopard as her opponent has been cut and bruised. It saw that the companion on the twilight side had jumped on his own, and after the twilight smashed, he rushed toward his side, so he screamed and jumped off the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to recite the spell, and this time he finally did not go back to the book that caused the crash. A seven-level chain lightning crashed down, and the elf elders were knocked down for the third time. This time the elders finally could not climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu, who was sitting on the ground for a while, got up, a collision, and knocked an elf out of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two elves left on the platform, one is the elf elder, and the other is the weakest elder Druid, in the first Thunder Forest Under the attack, I can't afford to hurt. Tiramisu gave a slap in the past, which greatly aggravated the depth of their coma, and it was impossible to wake up at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard’s tactics are very clear, he is using the terrain, constantly throwing the encountering elves under the tree of life. Falling from tens of meters or even hundreds of meters, these elves will be seriously injured if they die. It is not a serious injury, at least it will affect the combat effectiveness. The most important thing is that Richard completely dispelled the high-end combat power of the Elf tribe, so that they can fight each other, and the combat power is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instinctive reaction of the Druid elders was very keen. After the giant bear was knocked out of the platform by Tiramisu, they all chose the night leopard to transform. The form of the night leopard is falling from the sky, and the damage is much smaller than the giant bear. Unfortunately, their physical defenses are a lot worse, and their strength can't be compared with the giant bear form. It is easy for the team with strong fighting skills of Richard's legal staff to throw out the platform one by one. If the elves can organize a little, choose the giant bear form, and then add the natural magic bonus to the elder elders, the battle will become much harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard had just breathed a sigh of relief and suddenly his face was gloomy. At this moment, the soul link of the elite humanoid knight who is bait disappeared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slaughter captives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind of Richard, this idea flashed in an instant. Do the Green Sens know that the trend has gone, so take the first step to kill the captive human warrior? At least a dozen human warriors are locked up with the humanoid knight. However, from Lina, there are two hundred soldiers missing from the front and back, far more than a dozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite humanoid knight is only the creation of the mother's nest. He does not have his own soul like the ochre and the unicorn. Strictly speaking, it is only a certain degree. Follow the command to fight autonomously. But somehow, this humanoid knight makes Richard feel different. Perhaps he is responsible for the most important and dangerous part of the entire plan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Li is so sinking, all followers perceive the anger in his heart. Although the quicksand did not link with Richard's soul, she knew the dramatic changes in Richard's mood earlier than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say a word, put away the fate of the twins, took the elf long knife from the back of the unicorn, and then walked to the lower layer of the tree of life, while walking Ramp: "Continue to fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard used a lot of will to restrain himself, not to say the word kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it was down, Richard was in the first place. Liu sand sighed and gave him a war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wizard warrior did not know where to come out, he saw Richard, and immediately rushed over with red eyes. Richard did not say a word, double-handedly knives, and the elf-long knife danced like a lost weight. He slashed the bone blade in the hands of the Elf Samurai. Then he went straight and slammed into the elf warrior. On the lower abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf warrior bent down like a shrimp, and the blade of the nameless knife was already on his neck! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of Richard’s hand trembled, and the long knife cut through the neck skin of the Elf Warrior. Although the warrior was brave, but the long knife was on the neck, he could not stop any action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and finally pressed the impulse to fly the elf's head. Instead, he stunned him and threw it into the tree house next to him. This elf has the intention of surrendering, which is rare. The native residents who are willing to surrender are valuable resources. In addition to venting anger, the indiscriminate killing at the moment has no other benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearing the small obstacles, Richard continues to move down quickly. He had just rushed to the middle of the tree of life, and suddenly the tree of life trembled, almost letting Richard fall out of the wooden path. Richard immediately nailed the tree into the tree of the tree of life, which stabilized the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Richard thought that it was the tree of life, and immediately found that the vibration was not as dramatic as it was, and the source came from below. He probed out of the wooden road, just to see a tens of meters high, the trunk of the war has a few meters thick war trees, striding each step, let the earth tremble. It screams with anger as it walks, slamming the ground with thick branches to express its anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To measure the strength of war trees, in addition to height, variety, but also depends on the number of branches that can be used for beating. The more strength, the stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
