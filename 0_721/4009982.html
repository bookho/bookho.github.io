			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the sand that was still studying hard Some incomprehensible questions: "You have been reading this book of time, haven't read it yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sands of sand smiles, hands send the book of time In front of Richard, he said, "Let's show you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the book of time and looked at the book page, but only saw a group The smashing light, nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? Are you always looking at these things?" Richard asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand snorted and said: "Can you actually see something on it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All are a variety of light groups, the specific meaning can not see clearly." Li said frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is more surprised, and immediately said, "Wait, look at it with your grace, that is, the grace you received when you sacrificed at the Eternal Dragon Temple." It is now in your soul, try it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns, in accordance with the direction of the sand, trying to condense the eternal and timeless dragon's grace, sure enough The ever-changing light group seems to have a trajectory that can be captured by the naked eye, and there is a faint expression of the gods. However, the gods are very vague, and Richard can only distinguish a few incoherent words from the middle, which does not constitute a complete meaning. He still wants to continue to condense the grace of God. At this moment, there is a sudden burst of fatigue, a flower in front of him, all the gods disappeared, and even those smashed light groups disappeared one by one. The last thing that appeared in front of Richard was an empty page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was greatly surprised, and then turned a few pages, only to find that every page of the book of time is a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Empty?" Richard was surprised to return the book of Time to the drifting sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes time to see the content, you can see the content, and you can see whatever you want to see." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m going to fight soon, how can I still work so hard?” Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am researching a new magical technique, and I will soon figure out the last link, and it is very likely to catch up with this battle." While burying his head in the book of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of magic, need to work so hard? But it is just group robbery." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you start the battle, you will know. Oh, yes, tell me before you plan to cast the magic." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This magic is still related to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! It is for you "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team continues to bump forward and enter another ridiculous area. However, the guardian sand cavalry suddenly became nervous, and looked around involuntarily, and clenched the handle of the saber in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the earth began to vibrate slightly, and it felt more and more obvious. The experienced Sandman cavalry immediately dispersed and drove the truck to the center to form a loose guard circle. They all know that this is a sign that the cavalry is approaching quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first cavalry roared from the foot of the mountain, and then a group of cavalry followed, and in the twinkling of an eye, more than two hundred cavalry appeared in front of the truck fleet. The cavalry covered a simple dark cloak in the armor, obscuring the style and emblem of the armor, and the face was hidden in the hood that was pulled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a group of old and sharp knights, all of them exude a murderous murderous, obviously long-term battle. For the first knight to stand out, look at the truck and the sandman cavalry, slowly raise his right hand, and then make a fist. In the Knights of the Sequoia Kingdom, this is a very common sign language command, meaning to kill the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cavalry are obviously not only for the purpose of robbery, but also for robbery, and even the procedures for confirming the target are saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers came out from both sides of the leader, slowly approaching their opponents, and the murderousness gradually rose. This is also the usual means for experienced hunters to face prey, to force the prey to flee in an imposing manner, to take advantage of the gap to achieve maximum victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, the hood of a truck in the center was suddenly completely opened, and Richard stood up from the carriage and looked at the cavalry leader not far away. Sneeringly said: "Since it is a robbery, why don't you ask the car first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight picked up the hood and revealed a piece of cloth. The face of the line full of resoluteness, the eyes of the eagle owl, after seeing Richard, the pupil immediately contracted, and then squeezed a cold words from the teeth: "Since you are there, nothing matters!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said, "Don't tell me what you are, I can't kill you!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers leader naturally heard the meaning of Richard’s words, his face was bruised, but this ridicule did not interfere with his intentions, and the high-handed right hand slammed, screaming "All the military assaults, killing the light!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the two wings began to speed up the cavalry, Richard looked cold, the whole body magic Move, raising his hand will put out a fireball. At this distance, his fireball can't directly bombard the attacking cavalry, but the ground plowed by the fireball can force them to slow down or have to fine-tune the direction of the charge. Such a knight between the light and heavy cavalry, once stalled, the power will be greatly reduced. At that time, the exquisite riding and personal combat skills of the Shamin cavalry will come into play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, the quicksand suddenly mourned a spell composed entirely of gods, a pale gold if there was no time hourglass appeared in On the top of the head of Li, it was rushed and rushed, eventually spinning at a rapid speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shock in the whole body, only the magic of the whole body was mad, and it was just boiling! Even the preparation of half of the fireball is interrupted. Just such a delay, the most forward cavalry has ran into the magic attack range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The splendid power of brilliance is constantly revealed from inside Li, like a burning fire! The magical power of Richard's physical strength turned from boiling to burning, and the speed of operation was several times faster? His mind was moved, and suddenly his hands were raised, and the rushing spells had been smashed into pieces, turning into sharp whispers that the human ear could not justify! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, a fireball was continuously shot from the hands of Richard, and there were seven or eight fireballs flying in the air at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commander of the cavalry who is commanding the cavalry to form an assault battle has opened his mouth and can no longer be closed. The depth of the pupil is full of fireballs flying in the sky, he frantically thinks The knights who want to leave have stopped moving forward, but they know that it is too late, and in the end, they only have time to make a roar of madness and despair. The knights who are racing at high speed have deep fear in their eyes. In their field of vision, they are all fire balls that rotate in flight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
