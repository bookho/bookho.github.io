			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation of the Greenson plane, the starburst is reduced, but appears There are several vortices composed of pale green spots. This kind of vortex is a form that has never appeared before, it is very unstable, and the time of existence is very short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to capture a few and found that it contained all the energy of life. This simple form of life energy is as troublesome as the power of various simple attributes, and it requires a corresponding skill or meditation to be absorbed more efficiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy contained in this life vortex is rarely translated into magic, and most of it will overflow directly. Richard's elf blood can almost completely absorb the energy of the life vortex, just want to transport them to the range of the blood of the elf, it is not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund's blood is not exclusive to life energy, but it absorbs very little. When Richard accidentally entered the state of meditation in the Akmon family cemetery, the energy of the prison inflammation captured was clearly rejected by the blood of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when Richard is now meditating, he not only perceives the stars and the vortex of life, but also has many floating water-like energy. This is the elemental energy that is biased towards water, the largest amount. But Richard tried to absorb it a few times, only to find that their conversion efficiency is even worse than the life vortex. Only the branch of the element in the blood of the elf can absorb this energy completely, and that is not the direction that Richard is currently strengthening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has a faint feeling that he may meditate in different planes and perceive the energy unique to this plane. The ability to use this energy is related to each person's cultivation methods and their own attributes, especially influenced by the ability of blood. Some energy is universal, such as the magic of ordinary meditation. The starburst caused by the deep blue fantasy is a more advanced general force. Richard can detect the existence of the starburst in almost any environment and use it, but the number of stars in different environments is different. Less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the plane strength is different, and the density of the various energies perceived during meditation can be seen. The energy that can be absorbed in Noland's cultivation is much more intense, and most of them are based on general-purpose energy. Only in some special circumstances can we find a lot of special energy. In the plane of the next level, there is a plane with extreme power as the main body, and a plane similar to Norland, like Faro. But the latter two still have a gap from Noland in terms of energy density and magnitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard suddenly realized that he knew why the main plane was faster than most sub-levels. The upper limit of the so-called plane strength is determined by the law, but the form of expression is thin on the energy density. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, when Richard perceives his body, he sees a strange little space. The base of the space is a green meadow, and there are five world trees growing on the grass, but some of them are only virtual shadows, while others have grown very strong. The five world trees are connected at the root of the tree, and numerous roots must pass through the mudstone of the pedestal and flutter in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And around the world tree, it is a vein of dark red blood, which constitutes a huge hollow spherical network, surrounded by the world tree. Through the outer walls of these pulsating veins, you can see that there is magma flowing inside. There are several golden symbols in the magma from time to time. That is the real name that Richard is awakening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the star-shaped mans captured by Richard wants to be transported to the world tree, the first thing is to cross the grid of Akmon's blood. This is a very difficult job, because the tennis ball formed by Akmon's blood is always turning. To penetrate it, in addition to powerful computing power, you need to have enough luck. Every time Richard captures two stars, one must be intercepted by the blood of Archimonde. This is why Richard noticed that Akmon's blood began to suppress the blood of the elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard suddenly remembered that when he first entered the dark blue, Su Hailun was extremely curious about his mixed blood of demons and elves, and the reason was also here. These two bloods are, in essence, really difficult to co-exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Archimonde’s blood is not interested in the vortex of life, and there is also the initiative to avoid it, which allows Richard to nourish the blood of the Elf more efficiently. . Among the five world tree branches, the Magic Star trunk is the basis for Richard's future strength system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at these times during the Greenson plane, Richard tried his best to capture the vortex of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before returning to Noland, Richard still arranged meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using consciousness to lead a life vortex carefully trying to cross the blood of Archimonde. However, at the moment of success, the vortex of life suddenly swayed, decomposed and restored into the original life energy, and overflowed. Only a small part of the scattered energy is integrated into Richard's body and becomes magic. The rest is gradually lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee puts down his annoyance and begins to pull a new life vortex that has appeared nearby. This time, he has not yet arrived at Archimonde's blood tennis, and he is once again scattered. After six or seven consecutive failures, Richard finally delivered a life vortex to the magic star trunk of the elf blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main star of the magic star suddenly shines, and the top of the twig is dizzy and shivering, slowly sprouting a young leaf. After the young leaves are completely relaxed, the entire magic star bursts and vibrates, grows and expands, and finally becomes a world tree with a complete canopy trunk and roots! There are countless green leaves in the canopy, and there are no winds and waves. From time to time, the stars are shook and the main star of the magic star is dotted like a fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion of blood has awakened to the fourth stage, from the fourth stage, the elf's world tree will appear in full form. At the top of the trunk, a new twig grows, and there is an inflated leafhopper on the branch. I don't know when it will bloom. This branch will continue to grow until the fifth-order ability of the magical star is awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanding world tree canopy is almost topped out on Archimonde's bloody tennis ball, with numerous green tentacles protruding from the branches and leaves, and Akmon's blood tennis is explored. The roots underneath are also stretched accordingly, and there are quite a few outstretched tennis blocks. And from the magic star trunk, there are countless faint star lines, connecting the other world tree trunks and Archimonde blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard already knew the ability of the fourth level of the Magic Star to transform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this ability, you can convert several kinds of energy that are not easily absorbed into a starburst through the magic star tree. Although it still consumes about two-thirds of the conversion process, the utilization efficiency is greatly improved. Moreover, with the improvement of Richard's meditation ability and the promotion of magic, living in a different face like Greenson will soon face a situation where the starburst is not enough. To know that in Green Forest, the most is not the vortex of life, but the water droplet shape energy with strong water elemental power. Of all the energy that Richard discovered, this type of energy occupies more than 80%, and the remaining stars and life vortexes are half. In the absence of a splendid transformation, these energies cannot be utilized at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard does not feel the bottleneck yet, when his magic level exceeds 16th, the bottleneck will appear. His speed of sucking and boosting magic will slow down dramatically. This is the essence of the face of power suppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Richard, other strong people will face the same problem, the higher the level of the strong, the restrictions on the secondary plane will become more and more serious. When they reach a certain level, they enter various low-level planes. If there is not enough harvest, it is a waste of life. For example, Greenson, in addition to the use of natural forces of Druid, wizards, shamans and forest warriors, as soon as other professional powerhouses enter this plane, the speed of cultivation and improvement will be greatly slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
