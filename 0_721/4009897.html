			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a brown-skinned tribe, indicating that it is always in the blood Surviving orcs. The orc tribes that descend from the western highlands are mostly green or dark skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc tribe of the blood-stained land is not so good, even if it is not a small tribe, there are often more than 12 fierce strong. The orcs are born hunters and warriors, able to adapt to the harsh environment, vitality is extremely tenacious, and it is very difficult to arrest. On the other hand, the violent orcs are difficult to control, and more are sent to the underground mines for hard work, until exhausted, a small part is used as a gladiator. But the army of cannons cannot be formed, and the value of the orcs has fallen a lot. So the price of orc slaves has not been high, even lower than the sand people. A large number of slaves will rarely go to the orc's idea. The slave-caught team, also led by the 14th-level fighters, is much easier and more profitable than the orcs, whether it is to capture the sand people or the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs have a strong ability to multiply. Although their natural lifespan is two-thirds of that of human beings, their fertility is more than double, and children are over 10 years old. It is a qualified warrior. In addition, the orcs in the blood-stained land do not have any farming habits. Their food source is to pick the fruits and excavate the roots of the plants. The meat is from hunting various animals. The meat here does not exclude other intelligent races, although in the season of no shortage of food, the wisdom race is used to feed their wild wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every once in a while, when the orcs of the blood-stained land flourish and the number increases to a high level, the slave traders will unite to one. Fans sweep to reduce the number of orcs, maintain a smooth business road, and prevent the brown ocean from flooding the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, there was such a message in a news that the Jinhui Battle Flag Caravan that Richard met had brought him, and the big hunting operation would start again. It is. After considering it, he did not reject the invitation of old friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the peak, Richard saw a team of orcs with more than a dozen hunters walking a few kilometers away on the way back. They carried two heavy and fat mountain pigs, all of them happily, and it seems that they will not have to worry about food in the next few days. Around the group of hunters, they followed seven or eight wasteland wolves. For the orcs, these wild wolves are equivalent to their hounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard issued instructions in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wasteland wolf suddenly stopped, whispered uneasily, and nervously turned around. The orc hunters were also alert, put down their prey, clenched their weapons, and threatened the low-pitched columns on the sides of the road. Several large wolves appeared on the rocks, and the threatening atmosphere made the wild wolves begin to slowly retreat while whispering. The orcs have not realized that a deadly threat has emerged, they can't recognize the wind, but they are not afraid of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the wind is not a wolf, but a combat weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp scream in the air, and a sharp arrow was nailed to the chest of an orc until there was no feather. After the orc fell to the ground, he could still climb up, showing the strength of life. But the surrounding earth began to vibrate, the hooves sounded from far and near, and then began to roar like thunder! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the top of the peak and saw that the sandmen’s cavalry rushed to the orc’s hunter squad under the guidance of a few wind teeth, and they knew that the orcs were finished. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the barbarian warrior was led by the two ogres into the middle of the hunter squad and the orc camp, and the defense line was laid. Dozens of orcs that emerged from the camp ran into the barbarian front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde took the Orc Warrior and other knights and let the orcs who rushed out of the camp to support and turned into the empty orc camp. His goal is the orc wizard and sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs who rushed out of the camp were shocked and snarled and ran back. However, the barbarian warriors then chased after the end, and instantly defeated the orc's main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce resistance only existed for a few minutes and the battle became a massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all adult orcs, male or female, all died, the orcs gave up resistance. However, there are only less than 50 orcs left in the tribe of 200 people, all of them old and young orcs. Richard also paid more than 20 slave fighters at the cost. Such fierce resistance is not without reason. After the death of the axe, all the orcs began to go mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave himself a badminton technique and jumped directly from the cliff. The height of tens of meters was enough for the feathers to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell directly into the camp, strode to the altar, kicked the corpse of the sacrifice, and his eyes fell on the stone statue of the orc. . The statue of the orc is less than one meter high and lifelike. The whole body is carved from deep black rock, and the stone is even and crystal. In the near observation, Richard can feel the strange power inside the statue. It is similar to the feeling on the altar of the blood stone tribe. That should be the soul of the orc ancestor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He collected the statue, which was his main purpose in attacking the camp. Then he circled in the orc camp and found no other property worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru is busy again, and the two thirteen powerful warriors in the Orc tribe have the potential to be transformed into black warriors. This has become the norm, and after each battle, Sandro will always be busy to the last person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd cleaned the battlefield, Richard took out the map and marked the camp and surrounding area on the map. A month ago, this map was almost blank, and now there are quite a few places that show a clear outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Richard disappeared into the deep red twilight with a large-scale team, leaving only a broken camp and dozens of survivors behind him. The orcs that came down. This tribe has struggled to survive independently, only the tribes that merged with other orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a human perspective, no one will care about the survival of the orc tribe. Just like the orc country, there will not be many people who will care about Richard's life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orc is a race that is very particular about ancestor worship, which is very similar to the orcs on the continent of Noland. Almost every large-scale orc tribe has an altar to worship and worship ancestors, so they become the target of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although in the early days of safari, he also encountered orc tribes, but Richard did not order an attack. This time, the invitation to the big hunting from the Jinhui battle flag seems to clear his last hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard broke through the two orc camps and found the altar and the statue of the ancestral soul. Richard still remembers that the mother's nest needs this kind of thing. Flowing sand is also very interesting. She is interested in everything that has divine power and strength of similar nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is a rich land. The ancestor statue is needed to find the orcs and the sand people. The sand people are also very ancestor worship traditions. The soldiers are required to go to the slave team. Many of the slaves captured by the arresting team will become the soldiers of Richard, and most of the members of the slave team will become the black warriors in the hands of Sandru. If you want wealth, then Richard often encounters caravans, although most of the time he still uses the transaction method, even the cost price or the symbol price, but still trade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
