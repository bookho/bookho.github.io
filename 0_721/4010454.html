			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night nodded, bluntly said: "That is alive." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed a few times and said, "I have lived this bloody battle. How can I die in the future? But you have to be careful, but there is no future." The person is behind to help you wipe your buttocks. When you want to work hard, think about it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night snorted: "You are not dead yet, how can I possibly "Don't die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, Richard suddenly asked: "White night, you are not going to follow me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night shook his head and said: "The old man can live for a few years, I intend to stay and watch him. If I am not here, those guys may make the old man angry."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Lawrence has gone through the past, but the wealth accumulated in the past has accumulated a lot. The iron box is proof that if there is no white night, I don’t know what will happen. Thing Concentrated field of life and death, but also concentrated humanity, what is happening here is not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li sighed and said, "Then you take care, I will come back to see you often."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe you are a ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is laughing again and said, "Do not worry."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night waved impatiently: "Come on, maybe you can't get to the Rising Sun, and you will be slaughtered halfway."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seriously thought about it and said, "This is indeed possible." After that, he walked toward the white night and opened his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night was shocked and took a step back and said, "What do you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a pair of arms folded, she had already held her in her arms and tightened her tightly. She said with a smile: "Before you die, it is a little cheaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night let him hug, because the reason of arrogance does not bother to hide, instead of hiding, she wants to see what Richard dare to do, but after listening to Richard's words, the white night is as hard as a steel-like body. Down, arms open, stiff, only then hard to hug down Richard, obviously this action is more difficult for her than killing a few heavenly sanctuaries, holding hands, she said But it is: "That's good, I also take advantage of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two separated, and Richard and the girl strode away from the sun. Going, along the way, many strong people silently watched the figure gradually disappear and disappeared into the depths of the dark wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, on the road leading to the outside of the city, there was another strong person. This is a well-known one in the city. The Sanctuary of Heaven is also one of the members of the round table, but he carries a lot of pockets, which is quite different from the lightness of the previous hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gatekeeper of the city gate is a glimpse first, then greets: "Adult, you are here to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moving, going back to the snow and dancing." The heavenly sanctuary smiled and replied, today he has no special shelf, so the guard is somewhat flattered until his figure disappears into the dark wilderness. The guards suddenly reacted and just heard something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no panic in the heart and there was a panic. I was appreciating what I heard, and suddenly I saw a strong man on the avenue of the city. Carrying a small bag, guards piled up and laughed, and talked a few words in the past, knowing that this one is going to the Rising Sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after, in the guardian’s field of vision, the third Sanctuary strongman appeared, and he also wanted to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic clock points to the moment of dusk, Marshal Lundsted’s large desk has placed a stack of reports, each The report is behind a strong person who has left the capital of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office is very large and wide, usually there are six magic lights for the lighting here, but because the bloody battle just ended the tension, no one has time to add magic lights Fuel, now only two lights are on, making the entire office look very dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marshal leaned on the seat, his hands crossed on the desk, his eyebrows locked like a glacier-cut fjord, his hair was gray, the bloody battle lasted only a month, and the marshal seemed to be old. Ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the office was ringing, and the marshal’s perception had long known who was outside the door, so he ordered: “Come in.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards opened the door of the office, brought Lawrence in, and then retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man walked in, unknowingly found a comfortable position on the opposite sofa, and handed the teapot on the marshal’s table. In front of myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old people sat across the desk, no one spoke first, and suddenly fell into a deep silence. After a moment, Long De Steader slowly Said: "Licha has already left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he will go sooner or later, not today, but tomorrow, you should have known This will be the case." Lawrence changed the sleek and sloppy on weekdays, and at this moment it reappeared the momentum of the sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence looked at the stack of reports on the marshal's table and asked: "There are still many people who want to leave."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of thirty-one." The marshal seems to be careless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tenth of the people who survived, in addition, this is only the number of the first day." Lawrence is very unremarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did I do wrong." The marshal's face flashed with anger, and the voice unconsciously improved a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have never changed, and you never feel that you have been wrong. For decades, you have always been like this." Lawrence's voice is very calm and stable. "If you feel that you and Hastings can hold on to the sun, you will certainly not be wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But..." The marshal's double eyebrows were locked tighter, but I don't know why. For the first time, I couldn't find a rebuttal to Lawrence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence stood up and said slowly: "I am not a good commander, so I can't give you any advice, but I know if one The original subordinates of the lord are leaving, especially after winning a war. It must be that the lord is wrong. Think about it. As an old friend, when the council asks me, my answer will be Try to be as much as you are, I can do it, and there are only so many, and this time you are wrong, I don’t understand why this is the case. Maybe the answer is in your own heart, I don’t ask More."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence left, the marshal's office fell into darkness and silence. After a long time, the marshal sighed heavily and said to himself: "Answer,..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment in the dark wilderness, a black dragon is roaring, staring at the two Nolanders in front of him with four red eyes, excited to drown on the ground, in the eyes of the dragon, two Noland People are weak, and they are quite embarrassed. Actually, they are still arguing at this time. Do they not know that they only look at power in the battlefield, and any conspiracy is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black dragon does not understand Nolan, so I don’t know what a young man and woman are talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man pulled out a long knife with a serrated tooth and pointed to the black dragon. He said, "Shuihua, the use of the blitz is very particular, actually The upper structure is equivalent to the integration of shadow ban and two life annihilation, so if you want to exert its maximum power, accurate high-frequency attack is a good way. This black dragon has 18 talents and is thick and thick. Just take the test knife, I will give you a demo first, then you will try again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the dark wilderness sounded a black fire dragon The intertwined number is interspersed with the constant guidance and blame of Richard: "No, this knife is not accurate enough... Don't be so high, start practicing from the stack of three knives, what do you want to do, stack 20 knives I can't even do it.... The drop is too scattered. I want to concentrate on one place. Are you in the leeks..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Fire Dragon The barking soon subsided, and the wilderness became quiet again. After a long time, Richard’s Sound: "Two devil fish, not playing hard...for the use, oh, come, you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil fish is the magician's nemesis But the girl's style is their nemesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the devil fish, it is the captain of the horse, and then the skinny dragon...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The days have passed very quickly, and Richard has not found the best honing object of the bears, the first warlord, and the rising sun has already appeared on the horizon ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the girl’s momentum is completely different from when she left the fortress. She finally can’t suppress her own strength and become a sanctuary. By. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
