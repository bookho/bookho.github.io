I hope that we will There are a lot of trades in the middle of Amman. There are a lot of magic materials on the side of Amman. The number of minerals that Mr. Billier can get is amazing. And I, besides gold coins, if you are interested, Welcome to my slave camp to see. Maybe you can find the goods you like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slave Camp? When Richard noticed his heart, he immediately smiled and asked: "What are the goods in Mr. Tiffman's slave camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatever is there! Barbarians, orcs of all races, enemies of orcs, half-orcs, wild elves, or murderous sand-minded people can all be found in my slave camp!" Tiffman first waved his hands confidently, then Pressing down the voice, full of mystery, said: "And now, I have a lot of goods with very 'meaning' in my hand. If you are interested, we can go and see tonight."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked aside and asked: "Mr. Tiffman, I want to choose a group of slaves and build a escort. Do you have any suggestions?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffman flashed a ray of light and replied: "Slaves are the best cannon fodder! But they are also dangerous and difficult to control completely. As for what kind of slaves to choose, My advice is based on the size of the team or the common terrain of the battle. For medium or small-scale troops of less than 500 people, and the battle area is similar to a blood-stained area, my suggestion is that the sand people can overcome the worst environment and can drink water for two or three days without eating or eating. Lose their combat power. And they are still born cavalry. If the scale is small and you need to highlight the individual combat strength, then the headhunter tribe among the orcs is a good choice. The adult warriors in their tribe have at least seven levels of combat power, and Bloodthirsty. But they are also very dangerous. Finally, the Xuefeng tribes among the barbarians are the best candidates for the bodyguards. Their juveniles have eight levels of strength, and the well-trained adult warriors have ten. Level of the standard. The only drawback is that they are too expensive, haha!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffman told a joke, but everyone laughed at the table. Very happy, this also reflects the status of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Tiffman has actually issued two temptations in his ardent introduction. Richard's future combat area, whether it is a blood-stained place, usually the mode of operation, scale is still dominated by individual soldiers. Of course, he didn't expect to get any information from the young Master's face. Richard kept the same elegant smile from beginning to end, and did not make any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out through the door of the private room, where a prominent soldier stood, who was significantly taller than humans, even More than half of the head is bigger than Gangde, and there is a sigh of breath on the body. Although replaced with human costumes, it can still be seen that he is a barbarian warrior, with roughly ten levels of combat power, similar to Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out to the big man and asked, "Is that the barbarian warrior of the Xuefeng tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Zhagu, one of my personal guards, has been with me for seven years." Tiffman said, then called Zagu in, let Richard look closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood up, turned around Zagu for several laps, and threw two reconnaissances to him, pinching the body of the barbarian from time to time. Zagu’s face flashed with anger, but he did not endure it. Everyone saw the dissatisfaction of the barbarian, but the barbarian was only a slave, so his anger was not cared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care, Norland also had slavery, and what he is doing now is very important. He is not curious to pinch the barbarian, but to understand his body structure, especially the distribution of bones and muscles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a detailed examination, Richard has had a preliminary understanding of the race of barbarians. He returned to his seat, closed his eyes, and countless data in his consciousness were analyzed and sorted out. The image of a barbarian adult man gradually formed. Although there is still some ambiguity, when Richard has seen more barbarians, it will naturally be complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian has a superior talent and is similar to the orc. They are born warriors and can easily cross the 10th level, but it is difficult to be stronger, because they are difficult to cultivate vindictiveness, and they do not have systematic martial arts and cultivation methods like humans. For example, Tiffman's barbarian guard seems to have strong combat power, but there is not much room for improvement, and the limit is only twelve. Moreover, he has a low carrying capacity for the magic pattern and can only barely load a primary structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not look at the tenth-level fighters, but they have the power of the earth and the power of the outbreak, and they have undergone rigorous training in the death training camp. Germany can easily deal with six or seven such barbarian warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the barbarians also have the ability to have blood and high capacity, it is another matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wavering the barbarian guard to leave, Richard asked: "Mr. Tiffman, Zagu is indeed a very good guard. But he is a slave, after all. How can we guarantee their loyalty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zagu is the third generation of barbarians. The barbarian of the Xuefeng tribe has a benefit, they are very loyal to their ancestors The spirits, as long as they swear by the souls of their ancestors, will not betray them. They can be assured of them. This is why I recommend the Xuefeng tribe.” Tiffman explained with a smile, then shrugged and said: “But they are very Expensive, a potential teenager can sell thousands of gold coins. Like Zagu, I will give me 1,500 gold coins, and I will never sell them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard gently tapped the table, and made a determination after a while, and Tiffman went to his slave camp for a couple of days to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Billier, the minerals specially mentioned by Tiffman, looked at Richard and asked: "Mr. Richard, I heard. You are a respectable magician. The magician always brings us countless surprises. I don't know if you have anything other than the scrolls to sell. As long as things are good enough, gold coins are not a problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "There is exactly one thing that can be identified for everyone. This is the latest research result of my teacher, and he is also his alchemy and magic." One of the highest achievements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gestured to Oral, and the Elf poet took out a box and carefully placed it on the table. on. Everyone is a person who knows the goods, and immediately recognizes that the jewels inlaid on the magic box are worth thousands of gold coins, and the mosaic technique is exquisite and unusual, apparently from the hands of the elves. With just one such box, you can sell at least 1,200 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
