			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrival of Stevenson only provoked a small in the dark blue The small splashes disappeared into the rolling waves. Ten days later, the return of Su Hailun was huge, but it also did not cause much attention. Because every time the legendary mages return, they are equally powerful, even if they only go to the White Deer Forest 100 kilometers away for an outing. As for the results of the decisive battle between the two legends, no one knows, even Stevenson himself did not get the exact news from the family channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep Blue, as always, is running in a tight and orderly manner, driven by the flood of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Little Richard found that Su Hailun’s joy suddenly increased a lot this month, reaching a record 800,000 gold coins. This is a huge sum, everywhere, but not in the dark blue. After getting an unusually large amount of joy, Xiao Li immediately found that his course had also increased, especially one of the "Music Magic Array Foundation", which was independently guided by the big magician. Naturally, the compound magic array used high-grade raw materials. . In the price system of the deep blue malformation, Richard's ‘huge’ income is like a snowball in the sun. It is expected that the extra income will be completely consumed in the summer, and then it is necessary to worry about maintaining the balance of payments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene still delivers meals every day. There are more and more things to eat, and the eating methods are becoming more and more strange. The requirements for grasping time and frequency are becoming more and more strict. More painful is that the food is obviously a lot more strange, and some are even unbearable. But with Irene's companionship and explanation, the whole process miraculously no longer worked hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I finish eating, Irene will be intimate with him, in different ways. Sometimes it's a kiss, sometimes a touch, and sometimes a simple hug. Under the guidance of the girl, Xiao Li has a general understanding of the woman's body structure. It’s just that intimacy will occasionally trigger the boiling blood in Richard’s body, and he needs to be suppressed in a way that is close to meditation. But between ignorance and understanding, Richard has already predicted what will happen soon. The fruit is still green, and the instinct is driving him to explore the depths of the girl's body. However, the time left for the girl after the meal is not long, at most only five minutes. Every time she arrives, she will leave immediately, precisely as a magic pendulum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the month, it was the usual dessert time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the girl grabbed Richard’s hand and gently groped for a huge mother-of-pearl button in front of her, with a rough surface on her face, slightly rough. The senses of the senses that are more sensitive to food are particularly clear. Therefore, the large contrast of the lubricious and lustrous touch of the finger is more prominent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small Licha suddenly felt that the body's dryness became very obvious. In a hurry, the button was spread out, there was no obstacle inside, and the girl's body was attracted at the moment. The force is almost fatal. He violently pulled the girl's last clothes away, and the girl was only slightly confused at first, then held down Richard's hand and let him stand up, but he slipped down against Richard's body and then bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fierce watering, the fruit is nearing maturity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard looked forward to another watering, Irene suddenly jumped up and said in a hurry: "Oh, time is coming!" Hurry to pull the clothes, grab the tableware, and rush to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow...what will happen..." Richard thought a little blankly, his heart was still close to the limit and beating fast. Make him feel a little suffocated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, what was expected did not happen. Irene seems to have something to worry about, and her face is full of gloom that can’t be concealed. When Richard asked, she refused to say anything. After the meal, Irene grabbed Richard's hand on her chest, pressed it lightly, and then left in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intimacy comes at a price, and Irene will charge a gold coin no matter what level of contact. Richard, who is now familiar with dark blue prices, naturally knows that a gold coin is nothing at all, and may not be enough for a girl to eat. So he always asks a lot of questions to the girl and pays for it. It’s just that the fees charged by the girls are also very strict. They are charged according to the value of the information itself, and they are not willing to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, most of the information she can get is not worth the money. One of the most expensive intelligences was that after the magic duel, all of Papan’s followers disappeared from the dark blue, and some of them seemed to have never returned to their families. In addition, the entire duel is said to be related to another student of Su Helun, Randolph. The price that Irene has calibrated for this piece of information is 120 gold coins. In addition, there is no more than 50 gold coins. So Richard knows that all the gold coins that have been paid since January are not enough to support the magical practice of a girl's day. Of course, this is calculated by his own standards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this day, Irene’s attitude has suddenly changed, and her contact with Richard has become very modest, no matter how close the intimacy is, I will really pick the fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, the fruit is already ripe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also felt the change of Irene, but no matter how he asked, or managed to knock on the side, he could not get the answer. However, when he focused on eating carefully, the corner of his eye was occasionally swept away. From the bright smile of the girl, she saw another Irene was sobbing. So the world of Richard is also dark. In addition to the inevitable daily study and cultivation, Richard can't afford anything, and there is nothing special about the next month, only in a public lecture of hundreds of people. A person named Stevenson came to him and said hello to him. He introduced himself to Su Hailun’s students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time then goes as usual, and the summer comes quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene is getting more and more rushed, she obviously began to keep a distance from Richard, and then even one gold coin was not received every day. Therefore, special meals become more and more difficult to swallow, and the weight has been increasing over time. Richard is obviously taller and more robust. In his course, he added a basic physique and exercised as a professional warrior. Over time, Richard's magical cultivation speed is gradually accelerating, which makes him feel incredible, because most of his time is still crowded by the heavy variety of classes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of summer, the ice floes also entered the most beautiful season. The sea is calm like a satin, the glaciers are blue, the blue sky is washed, the air is clear and pure, and all the vegetation shows the most intense colors of the year, colorful and splendid. The number of tourists has increased significantly, and the beautiful men and women who are sunbathing by the beach have become a beautiful landscape. However, Richard did not feel in the mood to appreciate, and his heart was still cloudy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, Irene left the residential area of ​​Richard as usual. At the moment when the metal door was closed, a magic symbol on her corner flashed and sent the message far away. In the shadows of the distance, standing with a mage all wrapped in the dark magician's robe, the sharp eyes always fell on the girl, and she could not help but speed up her pace. Until the girl went far, the magician looked at the magic timer in his hand. The message received showed that Irene left the Richards residence within the specified time. He nodded, wrapped his magic robe and disappeared into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
