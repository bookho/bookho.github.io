			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes quietly, and Richard stands still, his right hand Constantly playing all kinds of little magic, and for an entire hour, Richard finally spit out a long breath, stepped back two steps, his eyes did not leave the light curtain, and his face was extremely complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a look?" asked the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head and said: "There is a way to be feasible, but it is also similar to no way, because the method of breaking the law is far beyond my current Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris and Simema quietly exchanged a look, they all saw the shock from the other side, if Richard said it is true, then He definitely has the most basic conditions for touching the rules, and Richard is still so young, he is not even a big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard’s mind is quite complicated. He did not think that the analytical ability actually found the law power used by the light curtain, and based on this, constructed this analysis. A framework of rules, but Richard also analyzes the time required to solve and master this rule with his current ability...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One hundred and forty-eight thousand days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha only knows that at present, with his own strength, he will never live for so long, so there is a way, but it is not the same, but the law is to crack this kind of thing. I can only rely on myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the nest in the depths of the void and looked back decisively. He walked in the direction of the direction and said, "Go back." Keep it here, wait until we have a way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One follower finally glanced at the ancient battlefield in the sky, followed by Li Go all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the light curtain, Richard did not encounter any trouble, and did not encounter trouble when he went down the mountain, but how many roads he took when he came up. When you go down the mountain, you have to go as far as you can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the nest, Richard was in the front, and the sand was behind. Both of them seemed to have some troubles. Inadvertently, they looked at each other and looked at them. Out of the other side of the heart of the matter, but they did not mean to talk, just silently exchanged a mutually encouraging look, and then continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Richard and Liusha think of the same thing, the scene of the top of the nest, they have all seen in the future time fragments, although those pictures are extremely vague, can not be sure whether it is definitely the nest, but very similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pieces of time are the vision of the future. Richard originally thought that it was quite far away from himself, and it would be hard to say if it really happened, but when When a piece of debris appears so real, Richard can no longer remain calm, and the remaining pieces of time will always appear in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people silently took the nest and returned to the Holy City, and then Richard re-allocated the troops, leaving the 30-ride rider to assist the Senma Township The blue plane, and promised to strengthen Hulan's plane channel as soon as possible, with 30 riding knights as the backing, Senma will encounter the dragon star will not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zonghu has sent back the news, he and Twilight successfully caught up with the Dragon Star, and once again hit him again, the only pity is to let the Dragon Star run This legendary powerhouse is only a true legendary level in terms of escape and life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Zonghu is the son of the gods. His attack is not so good. When he injured the dragon star, Zonghu even seized the opportunity to take his own A little source of power has also been sent to the past. The power of the gods is hard to describe. It is not all destruction, nor chaos. It is more like a product of mixing all the negative things together. The power of the gods is in the body, and the dragon star is absolutely not. It will be better, and it will take quite a long time to completely eliminate it, but no one knows how long it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard needs is that during the time he left Shulan, Senma was safe and stable throughout the situation in Shulan, and some time later, Lee After intensifying the passage of Hulan's plane, he could send more powerful people to search for the dragon star. Shulan is just a place where the palm is big, and the dragon star hides no place to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the knights began to send the door to the south side of the mainland, while the Richards and followers were on the star and flew directly to the south. Go, in less than a day, you can fly from the nest to the southernmost point of the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is also preparing to send a group of magicians to build a new plane portal in the Holy City, the Holy City and the Nest, is the rest The greatest value of the blue plane is, and Lina is buried in the Holy Sepulchre behind the Holy City. Richard will not allow anyone to disturb her sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to Noland, Richard chose to rest in Shulan for one night. The followers understood Richard's thoughts. He wanted to spend another night in Lina's sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the sand came into Richard’s room and sat quietly opposite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meditation, Richard slowly opened his eyes, looked at the sand, and sighed, saying: "The efficiency of meditation tonight is very bad." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking about Lina."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and sighed: "Yes. To be honest, I really didn't think she would do that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She may not know her heart at the end, but maybe she always understands "The feeling of flowing sand is also very awkward, and then her expression becomes serious, and the tone is also a turn: "But, Richard, do you understand what you are doing."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard's defense, Liu Sha said: "When the light of God's punishment comes over, why do you? Suddenly fly, don't tell me that you don't know that the light of divine punishment has a tracking effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "How else can I still?" The elite, the knights are exhausted. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Why not Knight Qudang package as "somewhat aggressive quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to smile, but under the bright eyes of the quicksand, he did not back down, saying: "In the range I can control, there is no way for other people to replace I am going to die, those knights are not creator creations, they are all living people, and they are fighting for me, full of ideals, no fear, how can I take them to stop the disaster for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know your responsibilities? Do you know how bright your future is? Do you know how many people are you hope now?" Three questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have me, Archimonde will..." Richard said that he will not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clearly knows that Archimonde has no Gotton. If there is no more, then it will be another scene. No matter whether Goliath or Soren or even Ellie, it’s not like Gotton. This can change the people of the current situation with a force, and followers, candidates for the Cavaliers, including those newly recruited Free Archimonde soldiers, in fact, all pinned their hopes on Lee Look at the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is no longer the stubborn young boy in the past, and now every decision he makes affects many people more or less. The political pattern of Archimonde and even the Holy Alliance caused shocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smashed Bear Peter and hit Joseph and Mensa, and Richard broke Joseph on this basis and continued to reinvent the door. Sa, on the record is not much more than the Gotton. Within the Holy Alliance, many people have really regarded Richard as another Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the only thing that Richard can’t compare with Gotton is that the followers have not reached the level of the thirteen knights of the day, and his own individual combat power is even more Compared with the volcanic man, the final shortcoming of personal combat power is rapidly filling up after Li’s burial in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard is indeed one of many expectations. His shoulders are heavy at the moment, and he has the same three problems as the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility, this is a heavy word, so that only the real man can afford it, but how to fulfill the responsibility, but there are many paths, and too many choices It means hardship in itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do." Richard asked helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should hide behind the formation of the Knights Square, the power of that blow can be blocked by the maximum of ten construction knights, if you do Narina didn’t have to die.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up at the ceiling and thought about it, and after a moment he sighed heavily and said, “If It’s not that you are suddenly bound by the power of time. At that time, you are in front of me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah.” The sand screamed, I didn’t expect Richard I noticed such small details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
