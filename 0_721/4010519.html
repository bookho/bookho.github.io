She always ran to dawn. Even Richard felt that she was being exhausted, but the girl was still fascinated, when the first line of sunshine shined in Karan. When there is a lot of ground, Richard’s deep body is like awakening from the slumber, and his physical strength is constantly pouring out, ending the weak effect brought by the wild bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the weak period, Richard jumped out of the girl, her swearing technique was not professional enough, and the bumps were sore and sore, the bones were like Dissipated the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the girl, when the next squat, the mountain and the sea are now sloping shoulders and long hair, a wide skirt, if not the natural strong exuding from the soul Pretty wild, she looks like a beautiful girl in Nolan, totems, nephews and those worthy of the city, disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did your appearance change?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Sacred Totem has been washed away. As for the accessories, they are all belonging to Calendo. I am not planning to stay in Calando now. I don't plan to take them away," said the mountain and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." Richard did not believe what he had heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to return to Noland with you," said the girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Richard never thought about this possibility, because for the entire Calando, the mountains and the sea are very important, the elders will Let her go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea seem to have guessed the thoughts of Richard’s heart, with a little smile, saying: “The elders are mostly arrogant that we both run. And the farther the better, so they don't have to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like, okay." Richard is speechless. It seems that good face is a common problem everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up and down the mountain and the sea, his face gradually surprised and surprised: "You only have..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl thought about it and said, "According to Noland's standard, ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can it be so low." Richard is hard to believe, in dark blue After that, it has been more than a year, and she did not even have a level of ten, and the last time she met, the mountain and the sea’s mighty momentum also left a deep impression on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's normal, if you want to fight in the past, you can use the power of the saint totem, and I usually spend most of my time in the Kikrama Peak. Sleeping at the top, the environment there is best for my body to grow up. If you sleep for one day, it will be equivalent to other barbarian warriors for half a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way... ...also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what to say, sleep can get powerful power, mountains and seas are just like the ancient dragons. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl said very seriously: "No one can sleep well. In the past, many people died on the Kikrama every year." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go first, say as we walk." Then, Richard took his baggage and identified the direction, and the mountain and the sea to the promise Rand Continental ran in the direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders may say that the mountains and the sea say that they are going to walk quietly, so that there is no need to worry about the ritual ceremony. For thousands of years, the barbarian ceremonies champion But it was the first time that it was taken away by outsiders. The elders used a conspiracy and then managed to remedy them. In the end, they gave Richard a relatively fair environment, but other barbarian warriors did not know these behind-the-scenes things. They would see Richard is the biggest obstacle on the road to the strong, many people will try to beat Richard to wash away the shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now does not intend to have more twists and turns, the barbaric slaughter has become a sacred killing, so he has no interest in fighting these barbarian warriors any more. He needs to go back to the territory and prepare for the whole army. Who knows that the threat of Chinese is just to talk about it, or is it going to come true? One thing is certain, that is, Richard has indeed broken the good things of the sacred dynasty, and it is quite a big one. thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea are not willing to fight against their own people, so they ran alongside Richard and went all the way to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunrise and sunset, the two quickly left the snow-capped mountains and crossed the huge river full of crocodiles before they stopped camping. Their dinner was a roast crocodile. along the way, Richard had figured out the Kikrama Peak. The mystery, this snow peak legend is the place where the deep winter lady was killed by the beast god, so it has the miraculous power, practice here, there will be no bottleneck, just endure the impact of the power of the holy peak Invasion, you can continue to cultivate until the legend, but the Kikrama Peak has the same danger as the miracle. The deep winter lady cursed the land when she fell, so the cold here has the power to freeze the soul, only those who have The incomparable strong will, and an unyielding soul can withstand the cold here, and the longer the cultivation time, the more the cold will become more difficult to resist, the cold here has the ability to paralyze the will, so when a strong When people find that they are unable to resist the cold, it is often too late, so every year there will be a number of strong people who are frozen to death at the top of the Kiklama Peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea are taken care of by the beast gods, and the power of the beast god protects her, allowing her to sleep for a long time in the core of the Kikrama Peak. When sleeping, the power of Xuefeng is actually slowly transforming and tempering the body of the mountain and the sea, so that all the qualities of her body are constantly improving. In theory, if the mountains and the sea can sleep all the time. If I go on, one day her body will become a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the mountains and the sea, and sighed deeply, actually had some embarrassing feelings, he now sees it, the girl’s vindictive water is very accurate In general, her body is the most powerful weapon. Her strength, speed and defense are very strong. However, the most terrible thing is her physical strength. Her physical strength is almost endless. She has such body as the capital. She really doesn't need to care about how much it is less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the warm campfire, the huge roast crocodile soon became a pile of bones, and the food of Richard and the mountains and the sea is no longer Compared, there is still only a feeling of fullness. Richard stood up and moved his body. He waved a small piece of frost and extinguished the campfire. He said, "It’s time to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mountain and the walrus yawned like a little lion, but lazily did not want to move, and was finally pulled up by Richard. At this moment, the wind suddenly became loud, and the wind blew through the forest. Some of the birds and beasts that could not be prevented were swept up. For a time, the whole forest became swaying in the wind. Richard sniffed and found that there was a strange smell in the wind, and he could not help but change his face. A loud scream: "Be careful, there is a very good Warcraft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice did not fall, suddenly looked up at the sky, in the distant sky, there are more than ten points of various colors shining in the light, through the thick fog, Richard finally sees what light there is, clearly is a certain behemoth The eyes, deep in the dense fog, are a few huge skulls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched his breath almost for a moment, and lost his voice: "The Hydra lizard, how can there be such a thing here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and the sea also changed their face, pulling Richard began to run wildly, while running and saying: "It is coming to you, run."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find me, why are you looking for me?" Richard was panicked and stared at the Super Warcraft, a Hydra lizard. It’s really important to be careful later. At this level, it is no longer a Warcraft that lives by instinct, but has wisdom that is not inferior to human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don't you find you, you ate its eggs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only then, so I dismissed all the luck, and fled all the way. Two little men, plus a huge snake lizard, chased and fled, crossed the land of Calando, all the way to the beach, when the wind had the sea. The smell of the snake lizard was not willing to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard and the mountain and the sea came to the island with the transmission array, stepping into the transmission array one after the other, when the magic light flashed Later, Richard set foot on the land of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only been more than a month after the time, nothing seems to change in Noland’s, but when Richard returns to the Black Rose Castle, Ark In addition to being surprised by his safe return, the Monde were also curious about the girl he brought back. Richard only intended to stay in the Black Rose Castle for a day. He hurriedly wrote a letter to Ellie and told her to After watching the movements of the sacred dynasty, take the mountains and the sea, pass through the transmission array, and return to the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the study, he found a letter on the table. This letter has been here for a whole month, and has been waiting quietly for Li. When the investigation came back, Richard picked up the letter. The envelope's handwriting knew that it was flowing sand. I don't know why. Before the letter was opened, Richard's heartbeat suddenly increased a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is the handwriting of Liu Sha Qing Li Ying. At first, she did not say the theme, but recalled the scenes when she first saw Richard. Two people took a carriage together and picked up the followers of Richard. Together they fell into Faro. Just like the magic of the sand, they left a deep impression on Richard. Richard’s talent in construction and magic is also I was surprised by the sand, but what touched her the most was the hard work and concentration that Richard did not dare to relax at any moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
