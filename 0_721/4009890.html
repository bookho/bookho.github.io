This is one. In addition, first Let me ask, does the Marquis have a special belief in the gods?" Li asked, his eyes wide open and looking at the old man and waiting for the answer, just like any eager aristocratic youth, humble and courteous, full of curiosity . What the old man seems to appreciate most is his demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Enek family sheds the double blood of the royal family and the legendary heroes of the first generation, so the Marquis family's ancestors of the ages are the ancestors of the family." The old man replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancestral worship, this is easy to handle. Richard now finds that he is more and more fond of ancestor worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Marquis does not mind, then I can sell a number of low-level magic scrolls, most of which are healing." Only the old man can hear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly flashed a glimmer of light, his look was serious, and solemnly said: "Which god is it? Want to use the magic The scroll must have the corresponding priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is the magic scroll of the god of courage. The benefit of this scroll is that anyone can open it. However, the disadvantage is that it will pay a considerable price when used. For now, it may take a few years to live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has been silent for a long time before he Say: "Between the immediate death and the unknown life, any wise person can make a choice. So this is not a problem, but the devilized scroll of magic in your hand is the place that really surprised me. Rest assured, neither me nor the Marquis will explore the source of these reels. This is the rule, and I assure you that no one will be willing to get involved in the troubles involving the true God. My suggestion is that if you can take this stain Give it to my store to run for you, then Strick’s trouble can be Gold coin to solve "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Well, tonight I will take roll call on you, "Richard quickly finalize the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard left, the people sitting on the side of the street looked at him differently, became more normal, and lost a lot of greed and murderous look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are a lot of agents of the big forces, completely ignoring Strick, especially the already dead Strick. The people who identified Stricker's men last night were all small agents with weak background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Richard re-enters the city, these people are still assessing him, mainly to assess his wealth to determine whether it matches strength. If Richard has too much wealth, then they don't mind secretly uniting and ‘taketing away’ the wealth that should not belong to him. But now, since Richard has reached an initial cooperation intention with Marquis Allek, in a sense, he is already his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Richard once again came to the grocery store of the old man on the street, this time he brought three scrolls of magic, one level two or three The magic of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still only old people in the grocery store. After accepting the three magic scrolls of Richard, he handed Richard a hundred gold coins as a deposit. It is only after detailed identification that the valuation of the magic scroll can be confirmed. So Richard took the gold coins and was surprised to find that these were also the gold coins of the temple, but they were not produced by the Temple of Courage, but by the temple of the God of the Highlands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not return to the camp outside the city, but went to the most luxurious hotel that had stayed in the city before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Blue Water Oasis, luxury hotels not only mean high prices and comfortable enjoyment, but also mean quiet and safe. This hotel is the industry of Jinhui Battle Flag Group, and the Jinhui Battle Flag is the top three business group in the whole blood-stained area, and it is even stronger than the red Cossack. Such as the Stich stream, I dare not go to this hotel to mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after Richard’s departure, the old man at the grocery store closed the store door, moved out of a set of alchemy magnifiers, and began to study the structure of the three magic scrolls. After watching it for a whole few hours, he took a sigh of relief and licked his waist, then took out a small bottle and pulled the cork out. Some shadows flew out of the bottle and quickly disappeared in different directions. The walls simply do not constitute an obstacle to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, three people wearing hooded caps entered the grocery store. They are very familiar with this and come directly to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is three elderly people. After they took off their cloaks, they didn’t even bother each other. They couldn’t wait to pick up the magic scroll and start to look carefully. the study. It’s been an hour since the three reels have flowed through each person’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the old people at the grocery store said, "Amman, where did you get these things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Old man Amman said: "It was a little guy named Richard who sold it to me. It was the slaughter who slaughtered Strick and his half of the cavalry last night and left their bodies in the camp. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other old man snorted and said coldly: "It’s an arrogant little guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Young people, there are families and strong people behind them, and it is inevitable that they are arrogant." Another person played round and said: "Clark, you used to be the priest of the Highland God of War, look at this The gods scroll is not true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man named Clark is silent and since he entered the grocery store, he has been looking over and over the scrolls on his hands. Under the alchemy magnifying glass, we carefully observed the direction of each line and every god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the question was asked, he said in a hoarse voice: "It is a real magic scroll, not a fake construction. The scroll should be from The god of courage flows out of the temple of Nei An. The magic seems to be fine and completely usable, but it is very different from the real magic scroll of Nei An. The mechanism and rules of divine power seem to be somewhat different from the god of courage. But the specific difference is not what I can analyze clearly. You see here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark points to the corner of the three-level healing reel and continues Say: "This structure has never appeared in any of the gods of courage, and nine of the seventeen gods have never been seen before. In addition, these combinations of gods are unprecedented. It’s impossible to understand what it means.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four old men in the secret room have become dignified and look at each other,” said Amman. The three reels are indeed stained scrolls. I don’t know. What is it that tarnished their "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".. Just do a little experiment, we can confirm, "Clark said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a golden plate from his arms, placed the magic scroll provided by Richard on the gold plate, and then took out a small scepter, read After the curse, the crystal on the top of the stick emits a glowing beam of light that illuminates the scroll of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
