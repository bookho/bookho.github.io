			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand broke the spirit and said, "Don't think about it so far." "Don't we win this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also true!" Richard laughed. He is the lord. If you are even depressed, how can you lead others? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Sandru came out and pointed to the Tiida who stood still and said, "Master, this body..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns: "Teddy is a true warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of the Sanctuary They are all real warriors!" The Necromancer emphasized. But after listening to him, the face of Luo Fu inexplicably felt a burst of heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing what Richard wants to say, Sander hurriedly said: "Master! You have to respect the real warrior, there is no real death knight! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha hesitated again, finally sighed and nodded. In this step-by-step crisis, improving combat power is always the first choice. He can't reduce the chances of survival of followers because of his respect for the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru was very excited, with a wave of his hand, four black warriors walked out of the magical array, carrying the body of Tiida and heading out of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the horse and began to swim in the blue camp, helping the soldiers under his arm to clear the enemy, while still staying in the military camp. An elite humanoid junior warrior gave an order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier then walked into the Chinese military camp. In the large camp, the laughter bursts, the wine is scented, most of the noble generals have already tasted the good environment, all kinds of jokes, wild history and cowhide are flying all over the sky, and the number of the priests of Shim is to brag about their own bravery and wisdom. And how many aristocratic ladies and girls have been conquered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite humanoid warrior said in a blunt voice: "The generals of Richard have orders, let everyone start camp immediately, go to the Blue Party camp. Adults say, may come down tonight Rain, go to the blue camp early to rest, so as not to get cold and rain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the humanoid warrior speaks, the tone is weird, there is no ups and downs, there sounds more How uncomfortable it is to be uncomfortable. But these words were heard in the ears of aristocratic generals. At first, no one cares, but the next moment, some generals who had not drunk home suddenly jumped up and exclaimed: "The camp has been captured!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, although many sergeants were still dreaming, they were still awakened and the army set off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the aristocrats who still had a drink saw the blue camp that was not extinguished, they couldn’t help but stunned. Those who can stand here are at least those who know how to fight. They calculated the time when Richard left the camp, then looked at the remaining defense facilities in the Blue Camp, and then looked at the more than two thousand prisoners who had been driven out of the camp, and felt that they were in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come you win? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels that Richard has only left for a little while, that is, the time for a noble woman in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still don’t know at the moment, and Tiida is also killed in this campaign. The death of every Sanctuary strong man will be a time for the aristocratic society to talk about capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy to beat a sanctuary, but it's hard to kill them. Especially in small-scale confrontations, if the sanctuary has a heart to go, it takes more than a few times more power to defeat him. However, in the ever-changing battlefield, all kinds of terrain, fortifications, sea tactics, large-scale magic and attacking equipment are variables. Even if it is a sanctuary, an accident will be seriously injured or even killed at any time. Luo's sanctuary strongman rarely appears on the battlefield fire line, even if it appears, it is to counter the other's sanctuary strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how amazed the aristocrats, the Blue Camp has fallen into the hands of Richard, calculating the time, not yet a complete day. At this time, there are more than nine days from the time when Richard promised that they could make another choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Western Expeditionary Army took a day off at the Blue Party camp. In fact, most of the time in the harvest and distribution, the harvest is mainly prisoners, slaves and a good city defense giant, and the blue camp itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This camp is important because of the water source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Blue Camp was almost hit by Richard, it was still strictly in accordance with the original agreement. This almost won the unanimous cheers of all nobles. At this time, they did not realize that after the cheers, Richard sent their soldiers to attack the hard, there was no reason to refuse and shirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole day, I was unable to see for myself the aristocratic generals who had been fighting last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With five thousand warriors against the four thousand defenders, and finally killed more than a thousand defenders, captured more than two thousand, only ran a few hundred people. The number of people who died in the war was less than 100, and the injuries were two or three hundred. The casualties were from the troops who entered the city, and the city defenses that burst in the near-air have also swept in many warriors. The proportion of such casualties is completely beyond their imagination. With their existing military knowledge, they can’t be played in any way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally knows what the generals are talking about, but laughs. These generals who are accustomed to the War of Faro are not sure how terrible fighting power can be played when a sufficient number of high-ranking warriors gather in the army and then full of magic and magic blessings! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this, has been deeply rooted in Noland. Otherwise there will be no appearance of a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Richard, there are a total of seven hundred nine-level fighters, and two hundred eight-level throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day of the morning, the army continued to leave, after a day of marching into the cracking canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rich production of cloud iron here, so there are dozens of forces, large and small, mining here, almost every month, so there is no survival. So good. At the same time, the terrain in the canyon is extremely complicated, and there are countless burrowing creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that in the depths of the mines here, it has already been combined with the dark areas, so that there will be inexhaustible underground creatures. Although most of them are cavemen who are not intelligent, but their combat power is not weak, and they are similar to human-aged men, and they use simple tool weapons. Once the quantity is enough, it is also a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ground-breaking canyon, Richard let the army rest for a day, and on the fourth day, marched into the cracked canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle, Richard steadily and steadily, step by step, the various units took turns, with the support of magic and priests, rows of heavy fighters such as huge twists The meat machine ruthlessly smashed the enemies with a large number of attacks but low combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from the air, Richard's army is like a steel torrent, slowly rolling forward, but unstoppable. In front of the torrent, the blood is constantly splashing, and after the flood, only the bloody road is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always stood on the front line and guided me in detail. Whenever a warrior is tired or hurt, there will be an order to replace them, and then add a small team of restful soldiers to go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a long-lasting battle. When the army finally walked out of the canyon, it was already five hours passed! During these five hours, Richard was always the most sophisticated alchemy machine. The commander never made mistakes, and the tone of voice was as initial. Even if there are occasional deviations in the execution of unskilled aristocratic troops, they will be immediately compensated. The rolling track of the giant meat grinder has not been loosened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the army passed, the bottom of the cracked valley was already red and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day, Richard marched into the Kampa Gobi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance to the blue water oasis is more than one hundred kilometers, belonging to the country of the sand people. This is a showdown between a human knight and a sandman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has drawn all the elite cavalry, and then brought the Gobi fighters who are not driven by the cavalry, with a total strength of less than a thousand and a total of Five thousand sand people ride on a battlefield of dozens of kilometers to launch a fierce battle of cavalry. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the third time that Richard’s army had cut through the formation of the sandmen’s ride, the sand people finally feared and left thousands of bodies, scattered escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the tenth day, Richard’s army entered the Cracked Rock Canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the home base of the orcs who are blood-stained, and there are tens of thousands of strong orcs living here. Richard just marched into the battlefield, and countless orcs flocked to Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every adult orc is a good warrior, and juvenile and old age also have a weak combat power, almost everyone is a soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war, Richard let the orcs see the power of the iron wall and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put all the troops into an intimate and tight array, the front-loading heavy warriors dying against the strong orcs, and the back row Dozens of magicians have just desperately vented magic to the front line. They burned with fire and poured with acid, while the priests continued to invigorate the magicians, speeding up and even overdrafting their magical recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rows of fires are burning, and in this case, the fire wall and fireball are the most effective magic. The reserve magic of Richard's Book of Hosting has also changed from natural summoning to fire wall technique. The poorly equipped orcs couldn't talk about magical resistance. They relied on their natural braveness to step on the sea of ​​fire and endured the pain of burning flames, hitting the front line of human reloading infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orcs are almost unequipped, have no tactics, and have no priests and magicians. Their sacrifices danced wildly, but the bonuses given to the orc warriors were negligible. At the beginning of the battle, Richard also analyzed the effect of offering sacrifices and prayers. The result is that the role of the ancestral worship of Faro is not as good as magic. It is no wonder that the intelligence he collected is the ultimate development path of ancestor worship. Seal God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a really hard battle. There are flesh and blood everywhere, weapons are everywhere, the flames of magic seem to never break, and the brilliance of the magic is gradually dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this battlefield, the individual's force was almost compressed to the extreme, and the killers such as splashes and ochre did not dare to leave the protection of the heavy armor. As long as they dare to leave the square, they will be shredded by angry orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of war is the stage of Iowa. There has never been a moment when the fighting priest is so brilliant. He is like a god in the sky, and he will save the lives of countless soldiers. Without his magical blessings, the already exhausted heavy-loaded warriors couldn’t resist the orc’s fierce shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time that Richard did not feel the glory of the Iraqi Russia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard’s role in the war is no less than that of Iraq and Russia, but he does not want others to notice this, and he even deliberately ignores it. Throughout the battle, Richard was repeating the only magic, five-level fire wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fate of the twins, the fire wall has not only doubled in size, but also burned more violently and more persistently. Richard, who is both energetic and energetic, has an unparalleled speed of magic recovery. And the elf magic star blood that gave birth to the second leaf showed its second ability to speed up the magic recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning wall of fire is a weapon for harvesting life. Richard’s true talent constantly collects the number of orcs that died in his wall of fire and is extremely cruelly displayed in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fearless orcs could not withstand the huge casualties and began to wailing, Richard finally issued the command of the general attack through consciousness, so his elite cavalry appeared on the battlefield. And straight into the orc army back, in one fell swoop, the dozens of exhausted sacrifices together with the guards into a meat sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a decisive blow, the orcs finally collapsed, but Richard has no strength to pursue, and he does not want to pursue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, watching the fierce scene of the battlefield, all the people were silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burnt orcs are layered in layers, almost innumerable. In the place where the two sides are intertwined, the bodies of humans and orcs have been mixed together, soaked in acid, burned by fire, stained with blood, and almost no one. For the first time, Richard did not insist on cleaning up the battlefield, but left without ordering, and let the generals of the team handle it themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This campaign, in front of many nobles, this young wizard has fully demonstrated his magical power and commanding art, but with a heavy number Leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this battle alone, Richard has released more than 30 fire wall techniques, and the number of orc warriors burned under magical flames is one thousand and sixty One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, all the nobles agreed to leave the Cracked Canyon for a distance without any objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few unlucky ones selected by the lottery took up the job of cleaning the orc camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually brought back a bunch of statues of ancestral worshipers, big and small, which Richard pointed out and sent Oral to supervise. The Elf poet is doing his duty and moving everything back that he can move back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Richard was that there was a statue of the beast in the statues with powerful power! According to the identification of the flowing sand, the statue is even enough to meet the standard of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
