			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One old and one less, there is no such thing as a chat, if closed With my eyes on, I thought they were sitting in the shade of the trees on a sunny afternoon, but the actual situation was in a dark, gloomy and tattered room, filled with blood and young, looking at themselves young. One of the internal organs was turned over and over, and the old man flew with a knife, cutting a piece of carrion, and then poured a bottle of green and viscous liquid into the abdominal cavity of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment has finally come to an end, Lawrence is preparing to close the abdominal cavity of Richard, only to go a few stitches, suddenly think of something, and force his own brain Then yelled and scared Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old man, what's wrong." Li asked, this sudden ghost crying, really scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost forgot something, look at my memory." Lawrence screamed away, and then heard a rummaging in the distance. The sound of the box is followed by a variety of strange sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is already a master in magical knowledge. Hearing these sounds, he feels like he is making a potion, he can’t help but laugh, his chest is opened, he is sewing. For a little while, Lawrence actually ran out, and it seems that he did not forget some kind of potion, but simply forgot to make that kind of potion, actually need to be made on the spot, if it is not his body's ability to recover is amazing, change the ordinary The sanctuary strong, can not withstand this nervous old man toss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for ten minutes, Surens rushed back, and Richard had no strength to blame him, and opened his chest to let the internal organs blow. This kind of experience is not something that anyone can easily face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This predecessor of the sacred sorcerer’s face is extremely cumbersome at the moment, and is even more excited than seeing a peerless beauty bathing in his hands. A dirty bottle containing half of the bottle of turbid liquid, and floating a lot of unknown meat. It seems that this bottle of medicine is really urgent, even the grinding effort has saved a lot, but Li listens With the sound, I always feel that the manufacturing process of this bottle of medicament is a bit strange. It seems that there is no special manufacturing process, that is, chopping, rough grinding, and then adding water, but the material itself seems to be very tough, and it is quite difficult to cut and grind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at Lawrence's expression, I obviously valued this bottle of medicine. He was on his toes and ran back all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The utility of this thing, you absolutely can't think of it." The old man smiled into a chrysanthemum, and even the saliva flowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, regardless of Richard’s inquiry and opposition, the old man directly opened Richard’s abdominal wound and poured the bottle of dirty and stinky things. Into the belly of Richard, he was so rude, so that Richard had a sharp pain in the incision, and his face was white. After the bottle was put into the abdomen, Richard only felt that the stomach was poured into a bottle of strong acid. There was a loud noise, and a large group of white mist emerged. There was a strange scent in the mist. After smelling it, people wanted to vomit, but there was a little more heat in the body. The blood was more flowing. Get it fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what." Richard was shocked and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence was full of light, his hands flying, and he immediately sewed Richard’s abdominal wounds, and then he didn’t know where to pull out a thick bottle. The white pulp fell on the wound of Richard. He only heard a bang, and a white smoke rose up. Richard screamed and sat up on the iron platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence finally fell on the stomach of Richard is actually holy water, and it is not ordinary holy water, but a sacred pulp that is thick enough to be unthinkable, this thing is really good. It is more violent than the effect of any magical technique. The side effect is severe pain. So that a bottle of holy pulp falls down, and the wound in the abdomen of Richard quickly heals. Finally, the chest and abdomen are as smooth as a mirror, and no scars are left. Of course, I understand that Lawrence’s intention is to make him unable to get the bottle of mysterious medicine in the abdomen. The wounds are all good, and what can Richard do? He can still cut his stomach, even if he In doing so, the bottle of medicine is estimated to have been absorbed by the body seven or eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard is convinced that Lawrence will not harm himself. He is now a half student of this wretched old man, and the old man has various shortcomings, but he It was a real concern for White Night, and thus pushed the concern to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and asked: "Now you should always tell me what the thing is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, you have to thank me very much, that is the essence..." Lawrence looked mysterious, approached Richard, deliberately lowered his voice, saying: "...the essence of the bear's first superintendent."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bear first warlord." Richard exclaimed, jumped directly from the table, and said: "It won't be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the bear head The refining pharmacy made by the Warlord’s **, but the lord of the Warlord’s lord, is intact, so it is made with a permanent effect.” Lawrence’s old face smiles like a flower, slaps Richard’s shoulder and shouts loudly. Say: "From today on, you are the man in the man, go, use the power that I have given you, and kill those who are stunned, let them know that my St. Lawrence is not only the soft foot That is, they can kill them in the frontal battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you..." Richard was angry and anxious, quickly examining the internal conditions of the body. But St. Lawrence got the blood, and the bottle of holy pulp was so thick that it couldn’t be opened. It was something that could save lives on the battlefield, but it was used to heal the wound. If it was placed in Noland, a bottle of holy pulp. Asking for at least a million, so after Richard’s inspection, he was desperate to find the body. All the injuries inside and outside have been healed, and the medical skills of St. Lawrence are indeed a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the injury healed, which means that the essence of the first bottle of the bear superintendent has been integrated with him, no longer each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He calmed down and repeatedly examined the condition of his body, but could not find an abnormal place. Everything was normal and normal, but the internal organs were dirty. The vitality of the device has increased, but he still has lingering fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence saw Richard’s gloomy face, and when he thought about it, he understood what he was worried about, so he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my level is you. Is it unclear? The medicinal agent was extracted from the top-level processing technology. It has removed the part of the bear's first warlord's inheritance, but retains all the special effects it should have. Rest assured, you will let the women born in the future. It’s definitely your offspring, pure enough to be pure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lawrence’s assurance, Richard’s decision was put down, even though it’s still Unable to verify, but Lawrence's level of medical skills is unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kid, I saved you, and helped you so much, made you a man in a man, and taught you the magical arm... Lawrence intimately glared at Richard's shoulder and said a lot of benefits to Richard. The big and the small ones were counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lawrence didn't stop at all, Richard had to interrupt him and said, "What do you want me to do for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence shot hard Richard's shoulder, said loudly: "I know that your kid is affectionate and will definitely help me with this, wait for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man flew away, and he flew back. He had a crumpled piece of paper in his hand and a line of pedestrians on it, which was given to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a look at it, seeing the names listed above, family blood, and some concise descriptions, as you can see from the name, All the women listed on the paper, and there are many prominent surnames in the family, but this paper looks quite old, I don't know how many years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some women who have been soft-skinned in the past, or who refused me. Now you have to do it, just in bed. I completely conquered them and let them know that my St. Lawrence is not only a few minutes... cough, um, that... anyway, you prove it to them." Lawrence was excited and said something should not be revealed. The secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was crying and laughing, but he had to open the subject and said, "This paper seems to have some vintages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems, let me think about it, it’s thirty years, or forty years, oh, look at my memory, about forty years or so, no, maybe fifty. Year..." The old man thought hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He steadily folded the list and put it in his arms and said, "I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just looking at Lawrence’s expectation, the phrase “I try my best” can’t say anything, and Li sighed and said, “This bear’s first warlord’s **, why don’t you On the body, can you not go into battle at that time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lawrence suddenly realized that he was rushing his forehead, and he was big again. Called: "My white night." The cry was quite miserable. Apparently, he remembered the 'convention' with the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence was so miserable, but Richard did not feel that he had any sympathy. Richard looked around and asked, "White night." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
