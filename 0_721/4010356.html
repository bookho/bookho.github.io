			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three days, Richard went to the West and continued to calm down seven times. In the rebellion, hundreds of people were executed, including outside the city of Wang, and they fought a large-scale battle with some of the rebellious city defense forces and the aristocratic private troops who came to Qin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of armies of the royalist party reached more than 4,000, and Richard sent 1,500 troops, which is almost all in his hands now. The strength of the troops, such a disparity in the strength of the forces, led to the loss of suspense in the beginning of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three minutes, the knight was smashed through the opponent’s front. Five minutes later, Qin Wangjun began to confuse and became a full defeat in the tenth minute. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite power of the royal family has passed the battle of Raymond Invasion, the sixth war of the gods, and the continuous blow of Richard’s direct advance to the king. The loss is exhausted. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After calming the situation in Wangdu, Richard convened a meeting of the House of Lords to formally announce the establishment of the deep red duchy, and he became the founding father, but Richard did not Taking this opportunity to leave the Sequoia Kingdom, it is said that the Crimson Principality is adhering to the permanent covenant with the Duke of the Wolf, and remains a vassal of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is not a pleasure at all, because Richard does not mean surrender, but to continue to legally intervene in the internal affairs of the kingdom in the future, Richard has already It is not ready to make the royal family better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that Richard revealed in the House of Lords was to reaffirm his identity as a knight and to update the direction and scope of the development, this time, Richard’s appetite is much larger, and he has placed the ancestral highlands, pale highlands, and turbulent land into the scope of 'exploration'. These places are the dangerous areas where humans have been helpless in the past few years, but there have been years of criticism The glorious history of the blood-stained land is, no one can say that he can't complete such a feat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard hangs a map, which is the territory of the deep red duchy. In fact, the deep red duchy is the majority of the blood-stained area, the predecessor The Duke of the Wolf officially sealed the jazz collar that he gave him, as well as a few small pieces that were taken from the Iron Triangle Empire and the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it was announced the result of the church war. Except for the northeastern part of the kingdom, the churches of the three goddesses will completely replace the church of the god of courage, all of which belonged to courage. The diocese of the gods are all divided into the three goddess churches. The religious taxes that the miners originally had to pay are also transferred to the churches of the three goddesses. As for the reform of the lower believers, they will not be enforced. However, some of them are closely related to the church. The nobles heard the unscrupulous killing sound from the last sentence, because Richard added a tone to the word at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Richard’s position in Faro was completely stable and became a strong party. At this moment, compared with the Faro’s positional forces, Richard can definitely be called a strong force, the strong is like a cloud, but the sixth time The end of the war of God, still let the Redwoods aristocrats breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to mainland practice, after a war of God, there will be a fairly long period of calm on the mainland, but what these nobles did not think is that Richard is already Thinking about the seventh god war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that the natural allies of the original Neian Xerxes and Sinai did not participate in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be many reasons behind this. The war of God is actually a very complicated matter, no less than the political trade-off between human kingdoms, perhaps because At first, they felt that only Nei An was enough to deal with the three goddesses, perhaps because of balance considerations. That is to say, if the advantage of one party’s participation in the war is too obvious and it is expected to get too much benefit, it is likely to make some The original neutral camp's gods changed their positions, especially in the priesthood, but they may be more or less recovered, and the injuries are much heavier than those in Inner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this guess is confirmed, then Richard does not mind giving Xuesisi and Sinai a heavy blow at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth god war ended, and the three goddesses unexpectedly achieved a full victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard does not seem to have obtained too many spoils in the war. He has neither claimed war compensation nor raised too many territorial claims, even The caravan share of the line has not improved too much, only 10% of the royal system has been collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard asked for and obtained was more of a religious right, but that didn’t have much to do with him, because almost everyone now knows, Behind Richard, in addition to a wizard who may be a legendary level, there is probably a mysterious and extremely powerful god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also keen people who saw Richard’s invisible harvest, that is, the Sequoia Kingdom is now almost the back garden of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a series of wars, Richard defeated and destroyed all enemies in his kingdom, destroyed their army, and more importantly destroyed the Sequoia The courage of the nobility to be enemies with him, at least within ten years, the royal family and the nobility who had stood opposite Richard, could not recover their vitality and rebuild the army that could threaten Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the economic lifeline of the Sequoia Kingdom is in fact controlled by Richard, the minerals of the Sequoia Kingdom, the dwarves of the pale highlands, and the output is more than ten times that of the Sequoia Kingdom, but the Kingdom Most of the slaves needed were imported from the original blood-stained land, the now-deep red duchy of the country, and all the caravans in the kingdom now in the deep red duchy have to pay a high tax to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sequoia Kingdom is only useful for food and wine, but these two things are the least valuable goods in the rich and powerful Faro. Even if the Sequoia Kingdom wants to blockade, Richard can also buy it from the Iron Triangle Empire or the Baroque Kingdom. There is also a large Principality willing to supply Richard Food. In a country where a farmer can feed a dozen people, the food is not at all. problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Richard’s gains don’t seem to be enough, so he won the reputation of 'kindness' in the upper class of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not stop at Wang Duo, but hurried back to Oasis City, and he left Gangde and Io in Faro. And leaving them with twenty knights, they returned to Noland with all the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Noland, Richard still has a bunch of chores to deal with, on the other hand, he should also seriously consider the promotion of the big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the big magister, a 20-year-old big magister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Magisters, not all simple things, although Richard did not feel his bottleneck, but he is not willing to engage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the accumulation of magic gradually approached the boundary of the 18th level, Richard found that his blood was gradually showing signs of resonating with the magic. The big magician has special signs of ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard wants to go deeper. His analytical talent finds that his different blood and magic have different degrees of resonance, which is obviously the most bloody of Archimonde. Strong, and the magic star followed, followed by the second-order recovery, then the nature, the elements and the monthly force. As soon as this sign was discovered, Richard immediately stopped the process of sprinting to the 18th level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to the golden level, you can’t be a bit sloppy. The first ability you get when you enter the realm of the big magician is even more important, perhaps second only to the legend. ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes an unexpectedly powerful ability can make a big magician reincarnate. For example, Dragon Master Lina, when she became a great magician, she evolved her ability to summon a common red dragon to an adult red. The dragon permanently signed the soul contract, and then she found the powerful Red Dragon Carlo, and gained the trust of Carlo, and since then became the real Dragon Master, and also become an extremely powerful big magician, even on the battlefield. It has the power to fight one enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to be promoted to the Great Magister is largely seen as a gift of fate, because no one knows what he will get. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Richard does not think so. Obviously, the ability of the big magician is related to the blood, and the relationship is still to be further clarified. It is not clear whether this association can be influenced by human influence, but since there is such a discovery, it is always necessary to try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to figure this out, Richard has an ideal place, dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after Richard returned to Noland, he took three long-legged dragons known for speed and flew to dark blue, now from The ultra-long-range transmission array from the dark blue to the floating island has not yet been built, but in fact, Richard can also consult the teachers of the past through magic communication, but Richard decided to rush to the dark blue. Another reason is that he wants to see it again. Look at the legendary mage who is sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is fast and has a long-term endurance. It wins the Griffin in the hurry, but they are fierce, they are bumpy and fierce during flight, and they have a strong body odor. For the aristocrats of the human race, most of them are used to transport goods, but at this moment, Richard is eager to catch the road, and comfort has long been thrown aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard started, it was dusk. When dawn came, dark blue was already in sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, unlike the previous time, Richard jumped lightly from the back of the two-legged dragon, and when he moved his body, he seemed to be in the spirit, and three heads and doubles The foot dragon is on the stone platform, tired and constantly vomiting white foam, even the raw meat sent by the black skin slaves are too lazy to take a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, my little Richard, how come you suddenly came." The voice of Black Gold came from far away, he got the news, the first time from My office rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
