			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the process is very similar and the results are similar, each time The fulfillment and the duties of Alize's partner are like a war. After the fierce battle, it is temporary peace. Richard lay on his back and stared at the ceiling. Ellie did not lean on Richard, but stood shoulder to shoulder with him. Lying down and keeping a distance, this distance is just the length of an arm, but on the same bed, it is very far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you thinking." Ellie asked, her voice was calm and she had recovered the style of the sand field, although she is now lying a bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking, why is this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ​​Richard is not without reason When the guardian elves may attack at any time, the movement on the bed can relax the nervous spirit, but it also consumes precious physical strength. In particular, Ellie has special psychological problems, which leads to each intimacy becoming a scene. In the war, Richard will stop. Ellie is not a sanctuary. She still wants to be physically strong. Because she is not exhausted, she will not stop resisting and struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice took a deep breath and raised her chest vigorously, saying, "I need to, truly feel that you are there."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao still doesn’t know her impulse to go into Lin Hai alone, but she can also vaguely understand what is hidden in this sentence. Richard himself has had a similar The experience, the feeling, is called fear of losing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will always be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a promise."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yong Night Tribe, at the moment, as its name, has been under the night When Richard’s cloak walked out of the tree house, the sky was still deep. It could only be illuminated by the hanging moonlight flowers hanging on it. Richard walked down from the tree of life, but saw a young elf girl. Standing on the side of the road, staring at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went to the little girl, kneel down and looked at her carefully. This is a little girl who is less than a meter high, but with big eyes, The full face has already predicted that the future must be a big beauty. She looks at Richard, she is somewhat fearful and curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard softly asked: "Why don't you go to sleep, rest well before you have the strength to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are leaving?" The little girl suddenly ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there are a lot of bad guardian spirits here, they don't welcome us, so we have to leave, choose a new place to live, stay away from these bad guys." Richard explained patiently and earnestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want to leave the tree of life," said the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and pointed to the tree of life and said, "It will also go with us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl has the courage to say: "But it doesn't want to go, I can feel it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a heart and smiles on his face Ask: "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl shook her head: "I don't want to leave, I don't want to."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight of Richard slowly moved up from the little girl's face and crossed her head. I don't know when, surrounded by a group of Everlasting Elves, listening quietly to him and the little girl. The dialogue, Richard has an unforgettable ability, in these two night elves did not see the two big Druids he is familiar with, no three sacred hunters, and no Master of the Noland era, this Among the group elves, there are not even a senior warrior of the thirteenth level or above. They are a group of ordinary night elves, mostly old people, women, and ordinary talents with no talent. They are the most common elves, the lowest level of the entire tribe. The high elves have distinct levels of hierarchy, and the hierarchy is much more complex than the human empire. On the other hand, the role of blood power in the higher elves is more obvious, and the strong blood is basically meaning. With a powerful force, this also strengthens the hierarchy of the elf society on the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the actual controller of the tribe, these lower elves usually intentionally avoid contact with Richard, so even though the Yongyue tribe has only a thousand elves, Richard But there is no intersection with them, but these bottom elves are the majority of the Yongye tribe, and more importantly, Richard understands that it is not the daughter of the forest like Merlin who entrusted him to take care of him. It's the bottom of these elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the traditional perspective of the High Elf, you are not a qualified leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard took back his eyes and said to the little girl: "But if we don't leave, we may be killed by the bad elves. Why do you want to stay here? Our new home has the same forest."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not the same, the forest there is not the same here, I like it here." The little girl tried to express her meaning, but she could not tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, an elderly Eternal Elf elder slowly said: "Richard, our tree of life grows on this land. For centuries, most of the people standing here are the elves who grew up under the new tree of life. This land is not only pinning our emotions, but also our familiar atmosphere. It makes us peace of mind and let us grow up safely. This is a special land. It is not free to be replaced. It has moved to a new place. Even if the tree of life is revived, it will take hundreds of years to form the same land. However, the place is For those of us who are born here, it is still a strange place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee slightly frowns, put his hands on the ground, close your eyes, start to be careful Feeling the breath from the earth, Richard did not feel anything special at first, but as his consciousness gradually calmed down, the blood of the elves in the body suddenly moved slightly, and the five life trees began to shine slightly, and the perception of Richard Almost the same as a change of frequency, see and feel things began to have different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the earth under the feet, the warmth of the silk and the lively natural atmosphere are constantly radiating. These breaths are very weak, but they are very pure. They slowly inhale into the body and feel the scent contained in them. Slowly, Richard understands that these natural forces are from the tree of life, but not the power of the tree of life. The tree of life will be its own strength. Dissipated into the earth, these forces are nurtured in fertile land. After a long period of time, they gradually combine with the power of the plane, and then overflow the earth. The natural atmosphere of the overflowing land actually contains a bit of the law of the plane. This kind of breath is absorbed by the elves, and the elves are improved day after day. Over time, the elves will become more powerful and will rely on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dependence is somewhat similar to the human hometown, but it has deeper substantive meaning. Richard realized this at the moment, why the elf will live The tree is so attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to leave, this is the true desire of these bottom-level night elves, they don’t necessarily need rich material and bustling city life, but before, Li Basically, they did not consider their ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's eyes swept over all the elves around him, and then fell on the face of the little girl in front of him. He said seriously: "Well, I will try my best to let the tree of life stay, let you stay, okay." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf girl’s face suddenly glazed and said, “Really.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really." Richard said solemnly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the night elves know that this sentence is not only for the little girl to listen to, but also to them, but a few years The long eternal night elves hesitated, because they knew the situation around them and understood what Richard’s promise meant, which meant that Richard’s knights would be in an unfavorable environment and occupy an absolute number of enemies. Fighting also means bloodshed and sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked to his own knights, and they confessed a few words, and they carried a long knife and walked into the forest alone. Shortly after Richard’s departure, Alice walked out of the tree house. The woman’s instincts made her feel what she was, and she refused to tidy up the clothes. She rushed directly to the knight and asked what was going on. There was a scream of anger and anger: "He went into the forest again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice huohed back and stared at the group that had not yet dispersed. Elf, if there is a fire in the eyes, the knights around her are also different. They feel that it is not right at this time. How dangerous is Lin Haizhong now, most of them have just experienced one. Back, it’s just that Richard’s position in their minds is too high. All the knights in the building have developed habits and are used to executing any of Richard’s orders in the first place before thinking about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Ellie pulled out a long sword from the waist of a knight, striding toward the group of eternal elves, beating The red short is found in a burning flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever asked to stay, let me stand up, don't push everything to this little thing." Ellie said coldly, long Jian Jianfeng has pointed to the little elf girl who just spoke to Licha. She has half a meter of light on her sword front. As long as she is excited, Jianmang can cut the elf girl into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop." With the shouting, a tall, nevernight elf suddenly appeared in front of Ellie’s sword, glaring at Ellie, he The momentum is even above Alice, like a sword with a sheath, which is one of the three sacred hunters of the Yongye tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
