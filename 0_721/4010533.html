			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to the Black Rose Castle, Richard also felt that Martin was everywhere They are all mysteries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard returned to the junction of the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Holy Alliance, the secret of the church was found at the door, and the secret was only one step away from the legend. The cardinal of the far-off, the rank of the church in the church is equivalent to that of Chinese. This shows the sincerity of the church. The secret ambassador entered the sacred alliance with the troops of Richard, and walked and talked. When the two sides reached a final agreement, Li I have already been in the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northern Line’s battle report has been passed back. Ellie’s victory and defeat, originally a stale battle, finally allowed her to seize the opportunity and raided the opponent. A lonely army full of soldiers, and captured a count, after a large number of ransoms, Alice also began to withdraw, the war on the northern line ended, and Ellie is not a famous, less than 30,000 The army and the 70,000 enemies were circling, and the losses between the two sides were 4,000 and 13,000 respectively. From the perspective of the strength and the final situation, Ellie once again won the battle, and it was not a small victory. More importantly, She accomplished the task of this trip very well, and held down the opponent's main force. Two-thirds of the elite troops in the entire area were attracted to her. The pressure on Richard's side was much lighter. The Duke of Solam’s strength was stretched and he could not arrange a decent blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation between the secretaries of St. Hui and Richard was difficult at first, and the key to the latter half was that Martin was involved in the negotiation process, Martin His identity is quite concerned. In his words, if the ransom is less, it means that he is not worth the money. From the expression of the secret ambassador, Martin’s valuation of himself is quite accurate, and even some premiums. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final condition was that Richard immediately released Martin and paid a million gold coins to the Church of St. Hui as an initiative to provoke war compensation, and An unpublished condition is that Richard can retain all the sacred objects he received from the St. Louis Temple. There are many powerful magical items and sacrifices in the sacred objects, but there is no thing that the St. Hui Church can't give up, in the eyes of the church. The real sacred thing is history, not strong in itself, the things that the seven saints used, even a branch is more precious than the legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the secret did not understand why Richard must insist on leaving these holy things. He thought that Richard was interested in the magic items and sacrifices inside, those When things are sold in Noland, they can sell about two or three million, but this money is a little money for the church or the wealthy family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also had an extra bonus, that is, Martin left his sacred script, which was almost ruined by Richard, as part of the spoils. The secret of the church secret was quite wonderful, but when After Martin said how many troops he had summoned from the Holy Scriptures, he immediately relieved and no longer opposed it. This process was seen by Richard. It is obvious that the number of calls for the use of the Holy Scriptures is limited. It was left to be used by Martin, and there was not much left, so the secret of the church would not care so much. Otherwise, with the ability of this holy scripture to be summoned, it would be so easy on all the artifacts that Richard had seen. The abandonment is that Richard himself never thought about leaving this holy scripture. In order to take it back, the Shenghui Church will inevitably do its best. Richard is equal to finding a very powerful enemy for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the look of Richard, Martin said very directly: "All the summoning abilities of this Holy Scripture have been used up by me, every ten years. It will also give birth to a new chance to summon, so it’s still a little worthwhile, just sell you a million.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only call once every ten years And it is one of Yinhui, Shengtang or Angel. Such a thing is equivalent to a quasi-legendary magic scroll. It is 500,000 expensive, but Richard frowned and agreed. This holy book that has been used up is still of value to him. In this way, the two sides reached a final agreement, and the Church of St. Hui recovered the face, because at least on the surface, Richard paid compensation, and the quantity was another. One thing, Richard asked the Church of St. Hui to know his strength and determination. The secret ambassador said that things in Caledo have become a thing of the past. The Holy Tree Dynasty and the Church of St. Hui are all in the past, and they will restrain Chinese, and Richard It also indicated that he would give enough respect to the shrine of the Church of St. Hui in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final outcome is very satisfying to Richard. It can be said that he has achieved everything he wants, and even extras of more sacred objects. If you sell it, it is not enough to make up for the many knights of Richard’s loss. The loss of the Church of St. Hui is even greater. The holy book is simply priceless. If used properly, in a battle of 100,000 levels. Can be the power to reverse the battle, and in personal warfare, it can completely kill a legend, if the legend does not run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, this is a war where both sides are hurt and no one is benefiting. The real role is to let them clearly recognize each other’s strength. Avoiding further hostility, in the case of Richard, this is the most valuable time and strategy for him to make room for it. If he is still distracted in the Nolanes to deal with the behemoth of the Church, then Faro. It can be completely abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key factor that can achieve such a perfect ending is the mysterious Martin. This person makes his loss heavier than imagined, but also gives him everything he wants, so Richard does not know how to treat him. The key point is that the insight is actually ineffective for Martin, and every time I see it is just a very strong light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the negotiation, Martin will leave with the secret. On the eve of the departure, this rather mysterious young cardinal specially recruited Richard, wanting After talking with him in detail, Richard also had this intention, so the two men sat on the quaint and intricate terrace of the Black Rose Castle and opened a bottle of red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't accidentally appear in St. Louis." Richard asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "Of course not. In fact, I got the gods and went to St. Louis to wait for someone. Since you are here, then that person. It’s you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned slightly and said, “You know that I will come, why don’t you prepare some troops, you just put them in the temple. A knight of 2,000 people, I will not attack, but will turn around and go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled: "You think that I am in my hands Can the Holy Scripture not be able to reach the two thousand Knights of the Temple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent, indeed, the power of the Holy Scripture plus Martin is still in the Knights of the Thousand Temples On the other hand, Richard will not lose so many knights. This is the result of the perfect command of Richard and the brain-thinking. If you change the command of other people, the sacred warriors who have been summoned by Martin. Drowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know that I will come." Richard asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very critical issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prophecy, this is a trivial matter for my lord," Martin said in an understatement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Impossible, you know who I brought." Richard immediately retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy is a wonderful, powerful, and restrictive thing, even the tiniest prophecies inevitably involve rules, which have time The powerful benchmark rule, and the law of fate still above time, even the powerful god of the Glorious Lord, because it is the embodiment of the plane rule, it is more difficult to interfere with the operation of the rule. In other words, the difficulty of prophecy is more than a common mage, and the more powerful the target character involved in the prophecy, the higher the difficulty. Richard has brought a large number of powerful followers, not only food. The domineering lord, such a domineering guy, also has such a particularly difficult ability to deal with the dark magician Asiris, and the gods of the beast god of the mountains and the sea, want to predict the movement of Richard, almost Impossible things, even the Lord of Glory will pay a great price, and only the result of ambiguity can be obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
