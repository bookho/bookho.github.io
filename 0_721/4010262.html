			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond is constantly issuing orders, the Noland Army has become a whole, From a high altitude, it is like a roulette with numerous sawtooth teeth, which is slowly spinning, constantly tearing off the opponent and grinding it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Knights show their power in front of the Faroese for the first time, no matter how strict the formation, how strong the will, the iron hoof of the knight They were all fragile before and were repeatedly pierced. Even the most elite troops were defeated after being pierced twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the battle of the strong, with the escape of Zonghu and the death of Arnold, the powerful of the Faro side was finally suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war struck from noon to dusk, and ended with the complete defeat of the Faro coalition. The 120,000 Faro coalition forces finally lost less than 30,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thirteen township powerhouses and three big magisters of the 18th level and above who died in battle. The gods of the gods also suffered heavy casualties. . The Sanctuary of the Faro standard and the Magisters killed nearly a hundred people, and the leaders of the various aristocratic coalition forces also died. The goddess of war is the spokesperson of the world. Baroque King Arnold is killed and the senior priest of the Great God of War is also wounded and killed. In this battle alone, Ludre's church was so badly wounded that no more than a decade of hard work could not be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nolander expeditionary army also suffered heavy casualties. After the war of more than 30,000 troops, there were only 17,000 people left, almost half of them died. The surviving strong had only four Sanctuary and five great Magisters, and some of them had some injuries. The fifty-chief's knights were killed in the eleventh ride, and the nineteen rides were seriously injured. Only less than twenty riders also had combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, countless torches are ignited, and Noland's expeditionary force uses the moonlight and torches to begin cleaning the battlefield and treating the wounded. Raymond walked on a messy battlefield with a gloomy face. He did not expect to have just entered Faro. He had not yet gained a firm foothold and was attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it’s a high-level plane not far from Noland, even if it’s vast, how much time and time is it for people here? Can we assemble more than 120,000 elite troops outside the plane? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not Raymond’s decisive command of the Knights’ assault on the Chinese army, using the Baroque knight’s unfamiliar character of the knight’s tyrannical power, killing the Chinese army in one fell swoop Arnold, I am afraid there will be more casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is full of blood, screams and screams come and go. The soldiers of Noland have already set up camps not far away, and in another open space, tens of thousands of Faro prisoners are sitting together, looking at the sky with fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from Raymond, the two Noland warriors were tears, piercing a short knife into the heart of a comrade Ended his pain. In the ectopic expedition, the initial stage is the most cruel, because there are no priests and pastors, so many of the injuries that can usually be cured, have become fatal injuries. Although the army also carries magic potions, it is a drop in the bucket for the wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond has commanded not knowing how many plane wars, and I have seen this scene for a long time, but every time I see it, he will have real Pain. He coughed again, and some blood was covered up by the night. After he finally coughed, he took out a square towel, wiped his mouth, and then threw the squared towel with a mottled blush on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond returned to the camp and walked into the camp of a big magister. He asked, "Master, have you found the location of the Lighthouse of Time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great demon The instructor is a master of teleportation and time and space. He said with a smile, "I have roughly measured the location of the fixed channel of the plane. However, it is at least three hundred kilometers away from our current location."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Raymond had already expected to send out the scorpion, he was still taken aback, "Three hundred kilometers! How could the error be so big?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but the measured position is like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond spread a just-collected The map of Faro’s plane said, “Let me show, where is that place?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magician’s fingers are slowly moving on the map. Finally stay somewhere and say, "Time lighthouse should be here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked at the mark on the map and accidentally discovered the plane portal Living Built a city. “The blue water oasis city of the blood-stained land? This is a bit strange. Did Richard have developed so well in a short time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Staring at the map, frowning, then his fingers began to move on the map, planning the marching route in mind. This army came to Faro, and it was an expedition without a return journey. Only by winning the plane of the plane in the hands of Richard can they return to Noland to receive follow-up supplies, especially pastors and priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s marching route is moving on the edge of the turbulent land. Because there is a very eye-catching mark on the turbulent land, sometimes it is turbulent. Even the Nolanders, few are willing to go in areas where sometimes the turbulent flow occurs. A sudden turbulent time can get the life of a strong sanctuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This marching route is relatively straight, passing through the territory of the three principalities. Raymond has already expected that it will inevitably encounter resistance, but even the 120,000 coalition forces have been beaten. The army of these Principalities, Raymond has not seen it. But his gaze quickly fell on a piece of Gobi at the junction of the blood-stained land and the turbulent land, and he could no longer move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to defend and difficult to attack, the terrain is quite complicated, and it is a natural battlefield to guard the traffic in the depths of the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s double eyebrows are getting wrinkled, and he predicts that there may be a hard fight here. If he is Richard, then he will definitely give up the Oasis City, which is safe and defensive, and lay down heavy soldiers here, using the convenience of the terrain to fight the expeditionary army. But the problem is that Richard is a talented builder, but is he also a good general? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, what Raymond couldn’t see was that in the area he was staring at, there were tens of thousands of slaves under the torchlight, taking turns Fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gully gradually extended, and the wall of the stone block gradually increased. The stone mound, which is only a few tens of meters high in the middle of the wasteland, has been completely turned into a fortress. Richard’s army is constantly coming into the work that has just been completed, and the slaves are transporting piles of supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has placed more than 20,000 troops on the stone hills, and another 15,000 people are lying on the perimeter of the battlefield, or guarding the stronghold at the edge. . When the Noland Expeditionary Forces attacked the Rocky Mountains, the ambushing troops would attack their backs for the first time. In this small area, Richard assembled more than 40,000 troops and built a sturdy fortune, ready to stage a meat grinder battle here. And as time goes by, Richard is mobilizing more and more troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
