			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Clark came to Richard’s residence and informed him of it. In a moment, a barbarian warrior led him into the backyard, and then met with Richard in the living room on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the Blue Water Oasis, Richard is no longer the same, and the troops he led are even more important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Sinclair also visited the blue water oasis, Richard’s original land in the fringe of the city, the building is still intact, the servant is dead The escape of the escape, no one left, so he directly wrapped the entire hotel that was last stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the original guests in the store, they can only be wronged and they will move to other places. This is a strong and intriguing suggestion, knowing that the Jinhui Battle Flag Group of the blood-stained land is neither afraid of anyone nor money can buy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After robbing the red Cossack’s second-class caravan, the entire blue-water oasis’s well-informed figures are associated with the old between Richard and Red Cossack. Resentment, some people think of Richard’s first fire in the blue water oasis. All the incidents show that although Richard is still very young, the act is not too weak to be a veteran who has been rolling in bloody places all the year round. Therefore, no one dares to blame Richard for saying a few words about his bad things behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Clark’s request, in addition to Richard, there is still sand. In addition, only the body standing in the corner of the hall is covered in the hood of the hooded thick cloth cloak. When he saw the twilight, Clark’s eyes suddenly shot the fine mans, revealing an extremely shocked expression, and could not be himself for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight did not reveal any part at all, that is, the lower half of the face was buried in the thick shadow. When Clark's gaze fell on it, the twilight suddenly felt two sharp burning pains, as if it had been branded with a red soldering iron. It was shocked and it took a step back. The blade of his left hand also trembled slightly, giving a threatening humming sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw it, my heart was secretly vigilant, but my face asked quietly: "Mr. Clark, how are you interested in this guard?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark once again looked at the twilight deeply, and then he regained his gaze and shook his head and said: "I didn't expect that I could see the sundial here." Warrior! And she is still your guardian! I have never heard of anyone who will have the Sundial Church as a guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sundial Templar I have never heard of this before. Can you tell me something carefully?" Richard revealed a very interesting look. And he can smell a faint scent from Clark. Normally, Clark is not a legal person with a level of about eleven or so. He should not give pressure to Richard. But he seemed to be covered with a layer of fog, and even Richard could not see through. Therefore, Richard pays great attention to Clark, and he does not dare to neglect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clark did not immediately answer Richard’s question. Instead, he narrowed his eyes and glanced at him, seemingly to confirm the authenticity of Richard’s words. Then ask: "How did you get this guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Occasional, it wants a job, it comes to me as a guard." . Of course he would not reveal that the twilight is a special unit made by the mother's nest. The implication of these words is that Richard does not want to reveal the specific details of the twilight. If Clark is clever, it is best not to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
