			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the sea more than once, even in the dark blue Facing the spectacular scene of the ice floe bay, but once, it will give him such a strong impact as the vast ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughland’s sea is dark blue, blue is almost black, and it seems that bright light can’t touch the world under the sea, standing on the coast mountains. Overlooking the sea, the line of sight stretches out without hindrance. In the place where the eyesight is exhausted, the sea and the sky blend together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coldness of the wind, like every breath will condense into ice slag, even in the ice floes called "not frozen" The temperature is also enough to freeze the sea, but the sea in Hulan is different, still whizzing, and even a piece of ice floe in the sea can not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked back and saw the followers standing in the cold, but no longer the appearance of the past, no matter where they are. The weakest Oral even subconsciously wrapped his clothes to resist the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some inexplicable concern, Richard does not allow followers to easily perform magic or magic at the seaside, and the coastal mountains under their feet seem too fragile. The thickness of a dozen kilometers in the area is not worth mentioning under the pressure of the sea. Moreover, since even the light can't penetrate the ocean surface, Richard is simply unable to judge how deep the sea is under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to freeze is only one of the characteristics of the sea. What really hurts people is the lack of life in front of the vast ocean. In places where sight can be seen, Only the sea, the dark clouds and the whistling winds have nothing else. The wind on the sea is visible. When it whispers, it pulls out a gray-black track, as if the artist’s delusions of nature are transformed here. Become an entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the top of the coast levee, hundreds of meters high from the sea surface, the cliffs are straight and steep cliffs, as if they were cut by the knife From the top down, the waves on the sea are not so turbulent, it is more like a layer of foaming sputum, but when the sea water is photographed on the embankment, there will be a thunderous bang from time to time, which will arouse Hundreds of meters high mad waves, straight to the top of the embankment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood on the edge of the embankment and felt a few drops of water flying over the top of the embankment and falling on his face. The more he observed, The more attention is paid to the more disturbing details, the slight discoloration, and the violent waves, which indicate that there are unimaginable horrors under the sea. Once any creature is involved in such an undercurrent, most of them will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea and in the sky, there is not even the weakest breath of life. The sea of ​​Shulan is a vast, indifferent and cold world. Facing such a sea, Richard feels that he seems to have stood in the world. The end of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle, Richard only felt that there was an empty space around him. It seemed that there was only one side between the infinite planes. He was the last life in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black and white wind whizzed past the distant sea, and the chill of the bones pulled Richard back into reality from the illusion, and Li’s body trembled. It is already a cold sweat, so magnificent, it has a powerful impact that cannot be described. The more powerful the person, the more impact it will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Richard, the sand, Io, and Nai’s face are not good-looking, and other followers are not strong, but few people can be like Lee. The response was so strong that only Senma and Lina looked as usual in the team, and they had already experienced the impact of this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing Richard’s wolverine, Senma’s face has passed a stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This sea is very strange." Richard checked the blood of Akmond's blood and dried the cold sweat, and he said with a lingering heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of that moment was too strong, so that he almost thought it was reality, and at that moment, time seemed to enter a strange state, like It is stagnation, and it seems to be a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that Richard’s true talent has been in high-speed operation, it’s automatically resolved that it’s a state between illusion and reality, which indicates a strong danger. Let Richard wake up, and the consequences are simply unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just a fantasy, but a reality that exists in a form that Richard can’t understand. The real thing is that the most dangerous thing is to lose it. Part of the feeling of time, time may flow through the millennium, and the soul of Richard is equivalent to spending thousands of years, so old, and even die, may be in the moment before the death, Richard will be surprised that the time has passed so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This danger is quiet, unpredictable, and unpreventable, but it seems that the situation of other followers is not as dangerous as it is. Only the spirit was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma explained: "The people of Gordon said that the sea in this plane has some strange power, which will have an impact on the spirit and even the soul of the strong. The more impact, the greater the potential in the future. But as long as the will is still firm, this mental shock will not cause harm, there is nothing to worry about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No harm will be caused, Gordon said so Richard," asked strangely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma’s reaction to Richard was a bit confusing, saying: “Yes, Gordon’s adult said that, and we used this method later. The potential of testing young officers is to bring them here to see how much they are affected. Anyone who feels uncomfortable later proves to be a potential person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this happen to the entire seaside of Hughland?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, so far we have only found this on the seawall at the ends of the rift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, no longer asked, but stared at the sea and began to think hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Richard did not think that Gotton would make mistakes. He said that there is no problem, it should be true that there is no problem, but Richard can also confirm his feelings. The danger is also true. The only explanation is that the danger does not really happen, so other people, even those who are sacred, or strong like Gotton, do not feel the crisis that needs to be guarded. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like people standing on a branch sticking out of a cliff, but thinking that they are still standing on a cliff, as long as the branches keep falling, there will be no Danger, when people stand still, they don't even care about what is under their feet, but Richard is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Richard relied on his true talent to see the fog, and found that the roots are roots, not the solid cliffs originally imagined, in the moment of seeing the truth, In the heart of Richard’s heart, there was a shake, the body swayed, and the branches that would not be broken were thus at risk of breaking. From this point of view, it is not known whether the danger existed, or because Richard felt that there was danger, so It is really dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recalled the process of getting his true talents. At that time, a mysterious force appeared in the enlightenment ceremony of Luna Ai Lucia. During the ceremony, he gave him the 'real' talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the mysterious power had said a lot of words, but now I think about the 'real' talent, the mysterious power to explain that this is the ability to 'see through the fog, present the real', this ability can be said and the power that the world worships There is not much correlation, not even knowing whether it can be regarded as a kind of power. However, at this moment, Richard vaguely feels its extraordinary, in contrast, the other seven enlightenment talents of Luna, Including wisdom, it seems that the priority is slightly lower. The so-called priority is slightly less. In the language of magic, the level of the rule is lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took back his thoughts and nodded quietly, saying: "Good place, it seems that all the building knight candidates should be put in the future. Come here and test it, well, let’s go to the opposite side of the Rift Valley.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the northern end of the weeping mark, there is a undulating hilly area. Stone forests and natural caves are everywhere, and it is not known how the terrain is formed. If you use the geographical knowledge of Noland, it is very difficult to carry out the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the heavy snowfall, the ground is white and all the caves are covered under the snow, which becomes a fatal trap. Once accidentally falling into the snow pit, I don't know how deep it is, and I don't know if it will slide into other pits. Only soldiers of level 10 or above can move under such terrain, and the snow pits have self-rescue ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mark of the weeping is about a few kilometers wide, even if it is going along the coast of the mountain embankment, it is quite dangerous, the snow on the ground has already frozen, and it has been The black wind is smooth as a mirror, and then sprinkled with a layer of snow powder, which is even slippery than the pure ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wind is big and small, it will suddenly blow a strong wind, big enough to make a Warcraft stronger than the mount mount, if the power is not enough Powerful, then under the push of this strong wind, it is possible to slide hundreds or even kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong wind appeared from time to time, there was no sign before it appeared, and how far did it go, Richard saw that if a general army wanted to pass this coastal mountain Dikes, it is very likely that more than three or four percent of the soldiers will be blown into the valley of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the Gods Rift Valley looks like a rushing river, I don’t know if there are any other dangers, but since the sea can have such an incredible huge undercurrent Most of the bottom of the valley has dangerous traps that cannot be seen. It may be a good idea to tie everyone together and use the power of the group to resist strong winds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
