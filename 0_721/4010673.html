			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this magical soul, I don’t know when another magic will appear. The soul cannot observe the law of the ready-made magical soul, and then it will explore in the dark until it happens to make another magical soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And betrayal is not unfamiliar to Richard, and even today it is impossible to cast waves in his emotions, but looking at Winika, fingers Feeling his sticky blood, he always thinks of a person, the source of their common blood, Gordon, the tombstone on the family cemetery has not been generated, then does it mean that there is hope, if Gordon comes back Are you willing to see a scene of brother and sister disability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood for ten minutes before removing the handkerchief, wiping the blood from the palm of his hand, leaving the magic warehouse and heading to his study. At this moment, Ni Reese should have arrived at the study and is waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard entered the study, his look had become normal, and the magical soul was temporarily put aside, and Nyris stood at the window at this moment, 怔怔Looking at the window, there are only six rainbows in the moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the door, Nyris turned and looked at Richard, and smiled helplessly. He was still a completely neutral dress this time. But with that little face, it always makes people feel that this is a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, suddenly looking for me so urgently." Richard came to Neris and asked with concern, if not Nyris's heart Look, Richard does not want to stand so close to him, if not Richard has always reminded himself, always subconsciously attracted by the beauty of Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris sighed and whispered, "He said, if... If one day I need you, would you protect me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will." Richard gave a positive answer and then asked: "Is there something happening, Agamemnon, he knows." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at the ground in front of the toes and said after a moment: "He didn't know about this, he couldn't help me, I... I hope that you will help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of uneasiness in Richard’s heart. Shen Sheng asked: “What happened, tell me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris barely smiled and said: “Now It's not the time, I still... I can't stand it, I will tell you when I need it, Richard, by that time, don't forget your promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed out his own heart and solemnly said: "Reassured, you have my promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris suddenly raised his head Looking straight into Richard's eyes, the brilliance that broke out in the eyes caused Richard to have an idea to escape. Niris suddenly said, "Give me a hug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle between the comrades and brothers who once fought side by side, who once faced the life and death, this request is not excessive, but when the current Nyris made a request, Richard was somewhat hesitant, but still Raised his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his arms were lifted in half, and Nyris suddenly plunged into Richard’s arms, hugged him hard, and buried his face deeply. Into the chest of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly became stiff, I don’t know how to be good, the response is not, no response is not, his arms are stuck in the air, I don’t know how to retreat. . At this moment, Nyris suddenly shook his shoulders, and Richard felt that the hotness of the chest was spreading. Obviously, Nyris is working. Cry, but he completely suppressed his crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard’s heart is unclear, Nyris’s status is honorable, and he is also a sacred battlefield who has experienced a territorial battle. However, now I am so silently crying in the face of the face, and in his heart, what should be the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally embraced Nyris and patted him on the back. He said, "It doesn't matter, there is nothing big in this world, there are I am, I don't have to worry, tell me what happened, the worst result is that I don't want this floating island, I will take you away from FS."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nyris was shocked, his head never lifted up, and he whispered, "Really."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shen said: "Really."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris broke free from Richard's arms. At this time, he seemed to have controlled his mood. The tears on his face were not dry, but he showed a smile. "It is not so serious for the time being. I think I can still cope with it for a while. Ok, I have to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the study, Nyris suddenly turned back and said, "Don't forget your promise."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha pointed to his own heart, and the four emperors put down their hearts and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Nyris left, Richard spread the map of Noland, looked at it carefully, frowned, and the situation on the mainland changed as usual. Unpredictable, but now he has discovered Archimonde's biggest shortcoming: connections and intelligence, from Philip's serious injury to the indeterminate return, and the abnormal performance of Nyris, Richard is almost ignorant. Even if the small family of Fu Shide is willing to vote for him, Richard does not dare to believe in the information they provide. Similarly, he cannot trust the information sales organizations. In the face of such a major event, misjudgment is more than no judgment. fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has repeatedly thought about it, and feels that the best way to solve the current situation may be to find Nolan, to build Akmen through the relationship of the eternal dragon temple Germany's network, Richard can not stay in the vagrants forever, this time the unsettled strong return, has made him deeply feel that Archimonde has no trouble with the top power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before finding Nolan, there was still a problem to be solved, Vinica and Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl and her lover are sitting in the small living room at the moment, uneasy, seeing the magic array arranged by Richard in the magic warehouse, they are There is no courage to talk privately about anything, just dare to use eye contact, as for escape, that is to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the fancy rabbit like Vinica, Lucien seems to be quite calm, and is constantly comforting Venica. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard walked into the living room, the atmosphere inside was suddenly suppressed. Young men and women were huddled on a small sofa, as far as possible from Richard. Licha looked at Lu Xi'an and said: "Lü Xi'an, born in the Bilus family, your father is the Viscount Billus, as for you, 22 years old this year, is a 12-level swordsman, oh There are also sideline, socialists and poets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lü Xi'an eyes flashed in fear, stood up and gave Licha a deep rite, saying: "Li Observer, I got the magic soul inadvertently. Before that, I really didn't know what it was. My talent was not very good before, but now, with the help of your magical soul, my talent should be There is a big improvement, this talent is from Archimonde, so I am willing to work for Archimonde, I only hope that you can forgive me and give me a chance to make up for mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard ignored him, he looked at Venica and asked: "Are you going to bed with him, to be honest, otherwise I will let people check."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica suddenly pale, biting her lower lip and whispering, "I have..." She said, she hurriedly added: "But there are not many times."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and stopped Vinica’s words and said, “So, you violated the old obligation and there will be a corresponding punishment waiting for you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Richard looked at Lucien again and said, "How precious a magical soul is, you may understand, or you may not understand, Ming. It doesn't matter if we don't understand. We have enough geniuses in Archimonde, but the resources used to cultivate genius are far from enough. At this time, I don't need genius, but only need to punish the crime. I said, The entire family of Viscount Billus will pay a price for this, a heavy price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veneca After rushing to the front of Richard, he exclaimed: "Brother, don't do this. If you kill him now, you won't have to return to the magical soul. Why not let him work for the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "The rule is the rule. If it is formulated, it should be observed. If it is violated, it will be punished. Regardless of anyone, the seriousness of maintaining the rules is more important than this." Today, I forgive you, will there be more people tomorrow to violate my rules for more reason, those who are more powerful and whose mothers are more powerful, can they break the rules at will, I What are the reasons for punishing them? They are more powerful and valuable than you. Genius is not a reason to violate the rules. Wealth and power are not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lucien wants to say something, but still resists. In fact, under the system of the Holy Alliance, because the royal family does not have absolute control over the big lords, wealth and power can indeed offset the laws and regulations. Rational The greater the power, the less likely it is to be guilty, and with the exception of a few crimes, most of the crimes can be lightly sentenced or even pardoned by paying the redemption money, but obviously, since Richard is not willing to fortune and The power to open a side door will naturally not set a precedent for his so-called talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vinica’s face was getting more and more bleak, suddenly squatting in front of Richard and shouting: "Brother, look at the death of the father,."
