These rocks can be thrown out two or three hundred meters, and their power is huge. From the edge of the forest to the tree of life, there are thousands of empty green spaces. As long as they pass through the green space, the trees can directly attack the tree of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps of the tree people make the earth tremble violently, and the faces of many eternal night elves have changed. So many people who activate trees, they only rely on the activation tree. To stop, the long arrows of the hunters are sharp, but the power of dealing with the trees is not enough. It can even be said that it does not have much effect, unless they can shoot through the tree, but the Druids of the night are too few. They can make up to a hundred activated tree people. Is this enough? It is not a good idea to stop with the trees of the Yongye tribe. The tree is a wise life, and the activation tree is still a tree. They consume only the mana of Druid, and the tree man deals with the activation tree, and waits for the excellent warrior to consume the druid's mana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many activation trees that there is no solution for the Eternal Night Elf. Once they are allowed to rush to the tree of life, the huge tree of life will be torn by them. broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the first wave of offensive, let many of the night elves show their despair, many hunters put down long bows, pulled out long swords, and bite their teeth to jump down the tree of life. Prepare for close combat, their long swords are not too big threat to the tree people. What is really threatening is the heavy weapons such as the warhammer heavy axe, but these elf hunters have not considered this much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the first wave of counterattacks of the Yongye tribe came when the tree was a thousand meters away from the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless beautiful bands in the night sky, hundreds of throwing spears entwined with various colors, scratching the night sky, smashing into the most In the tree people in front, these spears are so powerful that some of them directly penetrate the tree body and penetrate into the tree people behind them. Those who wear the dark red tone will often ignite the tree people. The flame formed is extremely difficult to extinguish, and a tree of people is ignited into a huge torch. The throwing spear with dark and vindictive will cause the tree to cause various negative states such as decay and slowness, and the throwing spear itself causes The huge damage can not be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spears are naturally from the hands of the knights. Although they deliberately depress some power, a volley of the knights can force the legendary powers to be embarrassed. Where are the bark trees and rocks that are activated by the tree? Underneath, some of the knights did not control the power, throwing a spear, and even directly bombing the tree people outside the kilometer into two paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights threw the first spear and immediately pulled out the second one. They were obviously calm and did not panic because of the current enemy. Richard stood on the roof and watched the battle quietly. At this stage, he did not need to go into battle personally. There was enough command of Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of spears, Alice, who saw the victory, pulled out the sword and shouted: "All attention, bonfire powder, add flame vindictive, Throwing power is two-thirds of the standard, preparing, shooting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her clearer and louder voice, several builder knights put a dozen or so The box and the oil drum were placed behind the array. The box was filled with black viscous powder. The knights of the construction flocked the spears and put them in the box. The top was covered with a thick layer of black powder. Then they again sighed with anger and threw their spears in the hands of a large tree of activated trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spear thrown a halfway and began to burn fiercely. The fire was so incredible that the fire dragon hit the activation tree in the night. Two-thirds of the power thrown short spears are not enough to penetrate the tree, but they are enough to pierce their hearts, and the flames on the spears are extraordinarily fierce, and they will be completely ignited in a blink of an eye. The activated tree people surrounded by the fire will not be able to rush for a few tens of meters, and will crash into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree people make a sharp scream, not knowing whether it is anger or fear, although they have no wisdom, but the instinct of life is still there, seeing the burning The companion naturally reacted strongly, and the knights took the spears, the bonfire powder, and then projected, and dozens of activated tree people were ignited, falling down, a short distance from one kilometer to eight hundred meters. In the blink of an eye, there are more than two hundred burning trees, and in this direction, Ellie has only concentrated on one hundred and fifty knights, and another two hundred knights are stationed in other directions of the tree of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement of the knight’s movement is monotonous, but neat and uniform. The horrible lethality can be seen from the continually falling tree of activation. Under the command, the structure of the attacking knight has changed dramatically. From 800 meters to 500 meters, there are more than 800 trees in the burning tree. At this point, all the activated trees are killed. No one has the chance to throw a huge stone in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights began to stretch their bodies in an orderly manner and rested, but the elves of the night never dared to believe in their own eyes. Thousands of activated tree people were able to damage the entire Yongye tribe. When they are finished, the elves have not even recovered from the shock of the first tree people being ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building the power of the knights, in addition to dozens of people in the night elves, they all ask themselves no resistance, but Ellie’s The order is very clear, only two-thirds of the power, this does not count the horrible fire powder, to know that the life in the forest, most of them are afraid of the flame, at least the flame resistance of the night elves There is no place for sex to be placed on the countertop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest is still quiet, not only the night elves, but also the guardian elves hidden in the forest are shocked. No one thinks that this will be the end, one hundred Druid spent a lot of magic to summon the thousands of trees, and actually failed to finish half of the sprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great nights of Druid looked at each other and saw the fear in the other’s eyes. This is the army of Richard, these knights are They are the absolute killing machines. They are born for the war. Although the two great Druids are known for their defense, they know that even if they are incarnate as giant bears, they will not block a few spears. If the name of the knights is volleyed, they will be seriously injured. The five volleys will be killed. If there are ten volleys, it is a spike. Under the tree of life, there are 150 knights. These knights are volleyed, and the two great Druids estimate that the legendary Druid Green Ring of Jade Leaf will be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more horrible, there are more movements of the knights, and the great Druid who once joined the Grey Feathers Presbyterian suddenly became a cold, Li Inspecting such an army is that the elders are still there, and they are enough to push the Yongye tribe. At that time, they actually thought that they would seize power through the Presbyterian Church, and even if there was a proverbial support, how could it succeed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the earth shook again, and hundreds of trees appeared again, but this time among the trees, there were more than a hundred high-level hunters. The hunters began to shoot at a distance of 800 meters. Their arrows were entwined with natural light, and they whistled. Both power and range were more than doubled, and more than a dozen long arrows flashed. With a dazzling light, and instantly across a long distance, the knights who are shooting under the tree, these dozens of arrows are extremely powerful. At first glance, they are from the hands of the sacred hunters. During the flight, the wind pressure generated by a support arrow Actually plowing out the deep ditch on the ground, seeing these long arrows, is to see the shadow of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
