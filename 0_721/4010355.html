			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The request made by Richard at this moment is like receiving the god of courage in red All the sites of the Cedar Kingdom, which is a very heavy blow to the church that has worked hard for a long time in the Sequoia Kingdom, but it is not far from the bottom line clearly stated by the God of Courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Li said, although the great priest lost the temple, it is a crime of non-war. If he can talk to Richard on the bottom line, he will discuss the conditions of the armistice. There are still gods, so in this case, the great priest did not have much hesitation and room for asking for price, and immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Richard smiled and said: "I know that the great inner security must have a god, and the armistice has drawn a bottom line. I want to hear this. What is the bottom line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big god officer’s sweat immediately came down. If the armistice agreement was reached on the bottom line, then he would not have the gods to take it, but instead It is also possible to be punished. After all, he lost the residual page of the book that was carried, and if Neian inadvertently projected his gaze and found that he had leaked the gods, it would be a problem to have the life to serve the hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the fear of the great priest and smiled: "Don't worry, the conditions we just reached are unchanged, I just want to hear the great inner security." The content of the gods, verify some of the ideas in your heart, if you refuse to say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, the gods are like this..." The priest immediately said a bunch of content, which sounded not far from Richard’s request. The tolerance of Nei’an was to surrender the parish next to a small Principality. Since the Principality also sent troops to join the coalition, if Li It is reasonable to check the requirements of the parish or the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and looked at the big priest in a strange way, saying meaningfully: "Why people like you can do this position?" If you go one step further, you can enter the Cardinal Bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My devoutness to the great inner security is unquestionable, of course, without damaging the great Under the premise of Nei'an, it does not prevent me from having some small selfishness." When the big god officer mentioned Nei'an, he looked devout and radiant. When he said the latter part of the sentence, he put up a charming smile on Richard and changed his face. The speed is so thorough that Richard is also stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard for Richard to come back and look at the big priest carefully. Suddenly he asked, "Your name is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buskitz, Lord Richard, you can call me Abu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Okay, Abu, I saw a kind of thing on you." The rare potential makes me deeply shocked. I think we can have a deeper cooperation between us. So, I can help you to enter the Cardinal, and you only need to put some important gods in Nei.谕 Inform me in time, how do you see it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...this is betrayal, no, I can’t do it.” The great priest heard the cardinal When the bishop was a few words, he looked forward to it and immediately panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can do it, you only need a little trick, and you have this ability now, but you haven’t realized it yet, you Wait a minute, I will show you something.” Speaking, Richard randomly peeled off half of the blank paper from a textbook, then wrote it on it, filled it in a moment, then handed it over. Great god officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great God Officer took the piece of paper and saw it, and suddenly he was shocked, and then he immediately swallowed the question that was about to blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the paper reads: "How to make yourself look devout." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below, there is a series of content and techniques, and a very strange but unconventional spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this magic is to let the operator enter a certain state, become the kind of person he wants to become, time can For half an hour, it is said that if a person thinks that he is very religious, then he will become very religious during the duration of the magic. Even if the will of the true God sweeps over, it is difficult to find that this is a disguised state. For half an hour, it is enough to deal with the general church ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this magic requires the use of a mysterious power, and the way to cultivate this power is to mourn a certain meaningless language, the great priest is still The first time I saw the magic that didn't need to touch the power of faith, but all his knowledge told him that after the spell was launched, it would indeed release an uncompromising magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With it, you don't have to worry about what you are doing will be discovered by the god of courage." Next, Richard said the famous Theo's famous saying: "You think you are pious, that is, piety. It has nothing to do with what you do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage, including the little magic, is from the hand of Theodore, and he The mystery of being able to deceive the true God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theodore itself is actually a magician. He turned himself into a magician to study the mystery of divine power and faith, and Like Raymond, Theodore was originally a Solomonian scholar wizard, and the master of this department did have expertise in confusing reality with lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest repeatedly looked at the piece of paper, confessed to the letter, and then whispered the spell, the body flashed, the magic had succeeded, and the great priest immediately became A face of holy piety, as if a mad believer, he stared at Richard, is preparing to blame, Richard's wave is already a dispelling thrown on his body, dispelling the effect of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...this is amazing." The great priest was surprised and inexplicable. He could fully experience the ‘devotion’ of the state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's easy, isn't it?" Richard said with a smile, then pointed to the page in the hands of the great priest and said, "This thing, after learning Just burn it, and then completely forget that it once existed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great priest immediately repeated the page three times, keeping each word in mind In my heart, then my right hand stretched out, and a bright golden magical flame was set in the palm of my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shake shook his head and reached out and gently took the page back from the big priest’s hand and said, “Use magic or It is a natural flame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the page of paper burned out in the magical flame, the great priest looked at Richard’s eyes and had a real awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter who you are, the ability to master this true God can deceive, it is not that he can resist a little, and he seems to think of an ancient legend It seems that a little glimpse of the truth of the god behind the trace, which dates back to the time of the ancient gods, but the great priest immediately chilled and expelled all thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To solve the problem of faith, let us see how to make your gods more intense." Said, Richard took a map, which is also a trophy from the temple, marked with courage God is distributed in the Sequoia Kingdom and the parishes and shrines in the surrounding areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a hook, and the northeast corner of the Sequoia Kingdom draws a piece of land equal to the size of the Principality. There are two temples of courage and three gods. The first-level parish, then refers to the big gods, saying: "I can return this area to you, continue to retain the faith of Nei, it is your merits, this should be enough for you to enter the cardinal." But the great priest of Busquets was not ecstatic, but instead he said, "This feat is enough to make an ordinary pastor a cardinal. Why do you want it?" Look for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "Two reasons, one is that you have this ability, you see, the magician you learn Yes, this is proof, second, because you are afraid of death, I just took a fancy to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great god's sweat has come down again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and reminded: "You have to be careful, this magic is not a panacea. When Nei has doubts, he focuses his attention. When you look at you, your disguise will be invalid, so don't be arrogant, don't do stupid things, such as betraying the agreement between us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure, must." Busquets finally understood that if he turned his back on the agreement with Richard, then it is likely that there will be a secret letter on the next day to the Pope's desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abu, this is also for you." Richard threw the sin and punishment to the great priest, and the great priest hurriedly took it in his arms. In the meantime, Richard has already recorded all the above in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the priest of the courageous god left the temple and walked to another great shrine in Nei An, on foot. Ziz’s insistence, he believes that only this way can slightly reduce his sin, in any case, the temple is thrown away from his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other clerics are not as heavy as the big priests, and even a few young pastors are talking and laughing, because they know that the great priests have been with Li The establishment of the armistice agreement, and the conditions are quite generous, this agreement to bring back, not only will not have any punishment, rewards and deities must not be too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
