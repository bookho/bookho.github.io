			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are natural servants who have been arrogant in the past, and the three captains immediately Caught over, respectfully stood in front of Pelisa Golden Horse. The Baron Fossa, who was welcoming, was left in the hanging bridge at a distance of 100 meters. It was not, but it was not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the people on the carriage? Why are you here?" Pelisagin asked, his voice was dull and empty, like the wind from the pores of the rock. Passing through makes people feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three captains looked at each other, and one of the oldest stood up and answered Pelesakin’s question. The original carriage was the home of three jazzs. After Richard released them, the two sealed knights escorted them to the town of Jovan. The captive knight in the town of Jovan did not know what to do, so he managed to collect more than a dozen carriages, sent his own deputy to bring two hundred soldiers, escorted them to the baron’s city, and let the Buddha Baron Sa is coming to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissa Gold nodded and said: "The rumors I heard were true. So, you two were once captured by the invaders. And released it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! We would rather die than die, those invaders may be because we need people to protect these noble husbands back, so we took us Released," said a captive knight who had been captured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about other sealed knights? I have heard of surrender." Pelisagin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There were seven captive knights who were captured before and after, and one of them was wounded soon. In addition to the two of us, the other captive knights Surrendered the intruder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissa Gold nodded and said, "Good, I understand." He suddenly raised his voice slightly, "come People, grab both of them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several knights came out and rushed to the two sealed knights. The captain was shocked and struggling, and shouted: "We are loyal to the temple and the baron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these knights brought in Pelissa Under the men, the two sealed knights had almost no resistance. A knight is simply knocking on their backs and stuning them directly, so as not to scream and harass the baron. Baron Palisagin is very fond of quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people on the carriages are taken to the castle of Baron Fossa." Pelisagin told me that another team of knights took over the team. And soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Pelisagin looked at Fossa, instigated the horse, and walked to the front of the Buddha without hesitation, turned over and smiled. Gently beheaded and said: "Respected Baron Fossa, seems to have let you wait for a while?" He spoke with a whip and gently tapped the black gloves of the fingers, looking as if he was participating in a wild hunting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fusa squeezed a reluctant smile and said, "Of course not!" His posture was a bit stiff, and Pelican’s dagger was the shallowest aristocrat. The etiquette is not counted. If he meets at the same level, he will inevitably become the following gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Pelisagin does not seem to care about what etiquette, attention is not on the body of Fossa, look around, say freely: "That's good, Please take me to your castle now, and I will ask you to arrange these warriors behind me. In the castle, I want to see how you interrogate the prisoners."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prisoner?" Baron Fossa was a bit sloppy, and there seemed to be no trial on his schedule today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissa turned back and stared at Fossa’s eyes until the latter’s forehead continued to sweat, slowly saying: “They are private hackers. Prisoner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Fossa’s face became incomparably ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two hours, a semi-public trial will be held in the Chamber of the Baron Castle. The trial targets two sealed knights who lived back from the invaders, three jazz ladies, seven jazz mistresses, six jazz adult daughters, and eleven underage children. As for the adult sons of the three jazz, they have been killed by Richard. In the aristocratic system, they are the main body of revenge in the future, and Richard does not want to let go of those who are destined to hate his life. As for the younger son, Richard did not care, and he did not have the interest to kill children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these children grow up and have enough power, Richard has either grown to the point where they can’t look up and returned to Noland, or It has become a dust in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator of the trial was a man with a head in the baron’s territory. The two surviving jazzers were summoned to the castle by the fast horse, and all the knights that could be found were Also all arrived, all the important people in the port city have come. There are dozens of people standing in the Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall council is very dim, and some cold, swaying torches do not add much light to the place, but add a bit of gloom. Sitting in the middle of Gaotai, the baron of Fossa, Pelisakin replaced a dark black aristocratic dress, sitting comfortably in the high back chair next to the Buddha, holding his jaw with his hands, drowsy, the focus of the eye is not known Where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Deputies is extremely quiet, and even the women being interrogated are afraid to sob. Pelisagin has gained enough popularity in the aristocratic circle of this region, and everyone knows that Pelisagin likes to be quiet, and everyone knows that the consequences of disturbing Pelisaquin are serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Pelisa Gold is not only the number one warrior of Count Garel, but also the relative of the Earl, and there is a legend that he is actually the illegitimate son of the Earl. So even though Pelisa Gold had all sorts of quirks and bloodthirsty, Earl of Galleon still reused him. From another point of view, even if there is no blood relationship with the count, the baron with fifteen-level combat power is the few strongest people in the entire White Rock Principality, and the Baron is still an outstanding general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two generals who are equal to the ranks of the Earl of Galion and Pelisa Gold, and one of the strongest individuals who have reached the fifteenth level, that is strong. The force is even stronger than Pelisa Gold. However, only Pelisa Gold is able to lead and fight. Pelisa Gold is also one of the most unwilling to see Baron Fossa. In fact, it is because of the speciality and strength of Pelisa Gold that the Baron Fossa could not afford to succumb to the idea of ​​competing with him. Don't say that he is competing, that is, he refuses some obvious unreasonable demands. If Pelisagin is a normal person, then he should have been a Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelissagin’s request is mostly unreasonable and without warning, such as this trial. However, Baron Fossa also knew that he did not satisfy the consequences of his request. The Baron, who was annihilated five years ago, was a tragic example. Afterwards, the Count of Galleon was only swearing at him and fined a sum of money. Half of the baron of the Barry has fallen into the name of Pelisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fasha listened to the expressions of the two captains and Mrs. Gao’s lady in a blank expression, looked around at the quiet listening, and finally looked at Paley. Sagin. The latter's eyes, which are half-closed and half-closed, are constantly sweeping over the people in the trial, that is, they don't look at the Buddha. Fossa finally knew that this was inevitable. He bit his teeth and pointed at the two sealed knights. He said in a low voice: "You... colluded with the invasion of the devil, can't be arguing, and immediately hanged!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
