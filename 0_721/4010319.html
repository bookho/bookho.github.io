			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the crows, the restraint listed in the hen’s nest At the beginning, Richard was a little surprised, and then relieved, feeling that these arms are still acceptable, but it is only an impact on his aesthetics from the elves and the masters of dark blue art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the crow, the tree of life is listed, not only the tree of life, but also the resolution of a series of species such as war trees and trees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the ancient trees and trees of the war can be classified into two races. The resolution of the tree of life is only 0.1%. This is Richard. The last time I whim, I sent a few pieces of the leaves of the tree of life to the nest, but I didn’t expect the mother tree to list the tree of life as a parsable race. Doesn’t that the mother’s nest can be made in the future? The tree of life came, and when he thought of the mother's nest creating a scene of a tree of life, Richard felt a mess without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further down, it is the analysis of the magic unit by the hen, here is the flag that the analysis has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is excited, this analysis will mean that the hen can create a combat unit using magic, Richard remembers, this analysis is extremely costly Huge, and only recently, he can afford such a consumption, which is a milestone in the mother's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly flipped through the information of the combat unit and quickly found what he wanted, magical ability, but the effect was a bit disappointing, the nest The combat unit is far from the real mage. These combat units only have the ability to use several kinds of magic. Perhaps because of Richard's own reasons, the nest is obviously biased towards the fire system in terms of magical ability and ability. Fire-related magic power is nearly half that of other types of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, Richard has had the latest impression of the mother's nest, he began to repeatedly study the arms data, in order to create a classic like the humanoid knight The arms are coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the ordinary combat units, the list of capabilities of special units has been greatly extended, from the original more than ten items to nearly one hundred, this is Because the mother's nest swallowed up a large number of big magisters and sanctuaries in the invasion war, but more than half of them are still in an unusable state, still subject to the level of the parent nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the list, there is a name called the eternal temperament, the name is the hen's own self, but this vindictiveness has left a deep impression on Richard, because that is the old man in the gray clothing sanctuary The vindictiveness used was sinister and sinister, and there was almost no solution. The Duke of the Wolf was killed in this vindictiveness, and the Duke of Glasgow almost lost a leg, and the power was directly reduced to the level of the Faro Sanctuary, but this The vindictiveness is also in an unusable state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking and discussing various types of arms and combinations, spent a whole afternoon of Richard, now the new arms are not only beginning to consume a lot of resources, but also for some powerful arms. At the expense of divinity, it can be developed, and the nesting light is as many as dozens of ethnic templates, combined with hundreds of various types of capabilities, the resulting array is completely an astronomical number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, after a painful choice of thinking, Richard selected his first magic attack unit, the flame feather snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame feather snake is essentially different from several other feather snakes because they release real magic, and more than one kind, the flame feather snake can be used every day. Release six enhanced fireballs equivalent to four, or four extended fireballs with a range of more than one hundred meters, and it can also release two walls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame feather snake adds light third-generation insects to the chest and abdomen, greatly enhancing their ability to resist long-range attacks. Faro's ordinary human bow and arrow The hand can't threaten them, and the elf archer needs to have enough lethality at a low altitude of fifty meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the flame feather snake will still be afraid of the mighty archer in the Raymond army, but the elite flame feather snake that the mother’s nest is going to create has the equivalent of ten At the third level of combat power, the whole body is covered with the third generation of heavy insects. At the height of 100 meters, it can resist the full-strike of the fifteen archer below the level and not die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the backbone of the army, Richard chose three types of arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a heavy barge with a barbarian as a template, a heavy insect armor, and a special strength. This will be the backbone of the positional battle of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category is the traditional arms knight, one of which is an upgraded version of the humanoid knight, the level power is upgraded from ten to twelve, and the equipment is fully equipped. The combat power is close to the human jazz-level knight, and the other knight is the super-precision knight that Richard is preparing to take away from Faro. They are not like the humanoid knight to achieve the 12-level combat power. Only ten, these knights retain the human form, in fact, using the orcs as a template, their strength has reached 12, the same configuration of heavy insects, plus the newly purchased magic light chain armor and knight plate, defense Has surpassed the ordinary structure of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard plans to equip them with a 12-level magic ride as a mount. As a result, the combat power of these knights has reached the level of the bear knight in the town of Schumpeter, and Richard has named this new knight as 黯The front knight, in order to show the difference between the humanoid and the black-winged knight, and the elite knight knight, due to its natural structural advantages, although it is a thirteenth level, it can be compared with the human fourteen-level quasi-constructed knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the long-range arms. It is still difficult to meet the requirements of Richard because of the analysis of the elves. Finally, Richard chose the barbarian with the long arm length as a template for them. Equipped with throwing spears, the savage spearmen of the 10th level are quite inferior to the excellent hunters in the barbarians, but as the extra-strength combat unit of the hens, they can easily throw the steel-throw throwing spears to 150 meters. The distance, which is impossible for ordinary barbarians, the special steel front throwing spear is very powerful, and can easily penetrate the heavy-loaded knight. Their shortcomings are also obvious, that is, it is difficult to form a high-density, high-frequency strike force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12th-order arms such as the Flame Feather Snake can create three more per day, and the elite units can use the power of the nest to produce 50 After the eighth-order mother's nest has evolved its creative ability, it can produce eight ordinary human-shaped knights per day. The nest can be increased to ten, and the three knights are not the opponents of ten ordinary humanoid knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard is actually facing a choice again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fixing the arms, Richard calculated the current military power in the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite backbone has about 4,000, the local Faro local warriors are roughly six thousand, and the aristocratic private army that Richard can mobilize is about 5,000. 15,000 is Richard's existing strength, and he is more than enough, but aggressiveness is quite inadequate. At this moment, Richard is not eager to expand in Faro, but is prepared to give priority to the situation and fix the advantages he has gained. The scope of the core control area, so now his primary goal of attack has been transferred from the Iron Triangle Empire to the King Sequoia King room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard finally decided to first add a batch of elite bats to the mother's nest, and then mass-produce other arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed to build a military plan, Richard had intended to end the communication, but the mother’s nest suddenly said: "Master, I feel that your blood strength has increased. Only by the connection of the soul, I can't fully share the fruits of your strength, so I need some of your blood for analysis and control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard immediately agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the future, every time you wake up your blood, you must remember to give me some blood, so I will grow and evolve faster." The mother nest squats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Richard also agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a huge mosquito flew into the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the observation and eyesight of Richard, immediately recognizing that this giant and the size of a giant human being that catches a big human being is a daily injection of Raymond The one of the vitamins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the mother's nest has long been waiting, and can't wait to get another new one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked helplessly to roll up his sleeves and let the giants take a sip. Fortunately, the giant mosquitoes were quite measured, only a small thorn on the upper arm of Richard. The mouth was not deep, and only three or five drops of blood were sucked and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the giant mosquitoes did not fly away immediately after collecting the blood samples, but kept spinning in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the consciousness of the hen’s nest came again: “Master, I feel that there are several things with powerful power in your vicinity that seem to be with shadows and space. Related."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, take out a shadow drill and ask: "Shadow drill, is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is, I need shadow drills, the more the better." This time, the mother's nest consciousness crossed the brain and was directly connected with Richard, but because of the distance too It seems a bit ambiguous in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha double eyebrows, shadow diamond is the core material he is prepared to use to make space equipment, so you must ask clearly the purpose of the mother nest, you can reduce Re-encapsulation of the space equipment, the benefits of the exploration of the plane is self-evident, and the number of his weapons is also growing too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest did not answer directly, but sent information from a special unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit is called Xingyi. It looks like a huge cocoon. It doesn’t have much combat power, but it can grow indefinitely and has floating. With the ability to fly, and after absorbing the shadow drill, it can open up space in the body instead of the general space equipment. Later, as the number of absorbing shadow drills increases, the space inside the body can become larger and larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
