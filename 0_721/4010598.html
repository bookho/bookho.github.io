			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the base city, Richard is directing a group of young mages to take one A precious magic instrument was placed in the right position, and he purchased a complete magic laboratory with enchantment, alchemy, potions and structuring functions. Now it is being installed. This is a large magic laboratory, which is composed of nine different. The functional laboratory consists of a warehouse that can simulate multiple environments, a small library, and a magical test field located underground. This magic lab completely occupies the entire three-story building, in order to control the possible explosion, the surrounding is more It is a thick wall up to ten meters in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a medium-sized comprehensive laboratory that can be used by twenty mages, and has been expanded several times in Faro’s laboratory. It has already crossed the large threshold and can be regarded as a magic workshop. In front of this laboratory, it has spent a total of three million gold coins, which is equivalent to the profit of Greenson’s normal year, and the subsequent books need to be supplemented. Reels, magic materials, parts for repairing various instruments, and the salary of the mage who works in the laboratory every day, add up to about 300,000 gold coins a year, so magic is a science built on gold coins, one ** Teachers must be extremely rich. If they do not have enough wealth to support them, their magical accomplishments will be affected accordingly. This kind of magic laboratory is enough for a newly promoted legendary mage to use in Faro. In the magic workshop, Richard has invested a total of tens of millions of gold coins, and ordinary legendary wizards can never have such a big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a new magic laboratory in Green Forest is not a waste, but a necessity. The plane properties are single and extreme, and Richard’s analysis of the plane rules has been reached. To a very high degree, some of the forces related to natural forces and life forces will be improved in the production of Green Forest. There are two pieces of material related to natural forces on the body of Li, and the people of the world and the magical armed forces. Moreover, Richard is quite satisfied with the time flow rate of Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Master is still hired from Deep Blue. They are very young and have a certain foundation. They can quickly get into work. Before they arrive, they are all Signed a strict magic contract, will work for Richard for more than ten years before they can leave, and the reward is that they can get twice the reward than the dark blue, and can also contact and learn the knowledge of advanced construction, this However, there is no chance in the dark blue, even if they are confirmed to have no talent in the future, but the training of high-level magic array will also make them profitable, if you can master several practical first-level constructions. Even if he is an apprentice in his life, he can live a lot on the continent of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men and women in this group of mages. When they passed through Richard, many of them curiously looked at Richard. They did not think that the Royal Architect of the Holy Alliance would be such a young and handsome. Young people, Richard does not even seem to have them big, and a few wizards who know exactly the age of Richard are even more afraid of their own eyes. A young man who is just 21 years old, according to common sense, is now At most, it is a ten-level mage, and it should still be struggling for the first-level construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reality quickly pulled back their floating minds, this vast and bizarre plane, the base city of its size, huge to almost luxurious magic The laboratory, as well as the expensive alchemy machinery on hand, belonged to the young man in front of him. A young mage took another look at the alchemy machinery held in his hand. The complex and exaggerated logo on the top of the cover pierced his eyes. It’s painful, and a long string of flying signatures makes people’s heart beat faster. This is the alchemy machine made by Dragon Blood Gnome. The long signature is the signature of the master of this machine. The word dragon blood gnome has already been used. The golden light is shining, this thing is still a private custom version from the hands of the master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young mages are sure that they will not be able to buy this equipment for the rest of their lives, and several female wizards will start to stare with fiery eyes. Richard, they all look good. It seems that working in this laboratory, in addition to normal harvest, still hopes to get some other gains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at a Taiwanese magical experimental device being transported into the lab, and the mood was finally cheerful. The laboratory of this size can now be called the black hole of gold. But the future is the source of strength and wealth, but this lab still lacks a suitable host, and needs to continue to feature. If Lina is still alive, she is undoubtedly the most suitable candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Li, a faint sorrow, Green Sen, like the gloomy sky, left Richard with too many bad memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a costume knight came in a hurry and whispered something in the ear of Richard, and Richard’s face changed slightly, immediately followed. The knight is leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, in a heavily guarded room, Richard saw Melin, and at this moment, Melin was just out of the forest, and she was on the east side. The wound in the west made people feel shocked. Her weapon, the only dagger had been taken away by the knights, but the spirit seemed better. It was because the priest of the Eternal Dragon Temple had just cast her. A magical technique relieved the injury. In a room that was not too big, it squeezed a full set of eight fully armed knights. After all, Richard’s last assassination was so memorable, so the knights were all In the bloom of vindictiveness, eyes staring at Melin, if she has another change, I am afraid that it will be split in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Melling." When Richard saw her look, she was immediately shocked and strode forward. However, the two two-handed knights took a step and stopped between Richard and Melin. They said: "Adults Be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm fine." Richard reached out and pushed the knight, or went to Melin and frowned at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline struggled to stand up, and as a result, this action provoked a strong reaction from the knights, all of their swords were squirted, vindictive and majestic. All of them were concentrated on Melin, which made her face pale and instantly shed two blood in her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine, I'm going backwards." Richard snorted and smothered, and he blocked the momentum of the knights. Merlin's face This is a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Richard, her face was calm, but her eyes were extremely complicated, and she sold out herself quietly. "Richard, I am back, I just want to be with you." Said that the day was not what I did, the elders of the proverb controlled me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said softly: "I know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline stunned, I didn’t expect Richard to recognize her in this way, no need for follow-up explanation, so she didn’t know what to say. what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Melin suddenly had a strange gray in the depths of her eyes, leaning back, but staggered and stood still. Then I looked at Richard and showed a distorted smile, saying in a hoarse voice: "See you again, Mr. Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen Sheng asked: "You are a proverb elder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard waited for him to finish, and said: "Let Mei Lin, don't play tricks in the future, I can let the Yi tribe retain, or consider giving you an independent status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Melin, the proverb elder smiled grimly and said, "No, I am not here to talk to you about the conditions, but to give you a gift, one A gift that can make you scream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Richard suddenly yelled and rushed to Melin, pressing the thick, natural glow of his right hand to press on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Richard’s hand was half a meter away from her chest, she saw that Melin’s chest began to fluctuate violently and violently, and the heartbeat frequency turned out to be a moment. It has reached more than 1,000 times per minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard’s heart sank, and the chest of the heart of Melin broke open. A blood spurted out and shot on the hands of Richard. Through the horrible hollow in the chest, you can see that the place that should have been the heart is empty at the moment, not only the heart, but her internal organs are almost completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline finally couldn’t help but fell backwards. Richard grabbed her and hugged her, while madly sending natural forces into her body. Say: "Insist, hold on, it will be fine soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this kind of injury, Richard’s heart is very clear, unless there is Vulture immediately At the level of the big priests, otherwise it is impossible to save Mei Lin, and more natural forces, just let her delay the time of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merline’s eyes turned to clear, the pain made her scream, and she temporarily recovered her consciousness. She looked at Richard and was almost inaudible. The voice said: "Richard, that day...not me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, don't talk, hold on," Richard said. The whole person was shrouded in natural light, and the magic of the whole body was transformed into natural power, and it was sent to Melin without stopping. At this time, Richard’s power touched a gray energy, and at that time in Li The cursing power of the body that can't be expelled is exactly the same, that is, this power lurks in Melin's body and controls her actions at a critical time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, there is so much residual power in Melin’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body suddenly leaned back and took the left hand of Melin’s stab. At this time, Melin could not have sneaked on him, and Melin’s eyes were Qingming was confused for a while, and was exhausting all his strength to fight against the control of power. However, the level of the law contained in the power was very high. Even Richard was helpless at the time. Mei Lin was seriously injured at this moment and could not suppress this power. The formation of entanglement has already shocked Richard with the power of her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
