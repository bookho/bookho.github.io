The blood crystal that condenses all the essence of the forest son does not know what to gain after absorption. The most likely thing is to awaken or have a powerful ability. It can be said that the value is not even below the top sacrifice. However, once the son of the forest escaped, with his terrible speed and hidden ability, it was impossible to find him under the suppression of the forest will, even if he had become a body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the biggest gain of this war is the friendship between Nyris, Agamemnon and Richard. On the verge of life and death, in the face of real enemies, they help each other, rescue each other, do not hesitate to block the enemy's spears with their own flesh and blood, or lay the foundation for the companion to finally kill the enemy. In that moment of the decision, there is no room for any interest to entangle, only to respond by instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha, Nyris and Agamemnon have different appearances and personalities. In fact, there is a volcano hidden in the heart. Although these young people have begun to have powerful power, they have not yet been swallowed up by too many realities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the post-war, they don’t need to say anything more, occasionally drinking wine together, and most of the time they are busy with their own stalls. The time for gathering is less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, the three gathered together, but it was a routine discussion of the next battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf tribes around the base city must have been hit hard, and a tree of life has been removed, and for at least a decade, there is no way to help the elves attached to it. The dead elves are almost all the warriors of the two tribes. The number of Druids is close to or more than the total of one tribe. The most painful thing is the fall of the son of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has learned from the elves that have been attached to it that the son of the forest is actually the caretaker of the supreme world tree in the green forest. It is the most outstanding genius in the elves, and the natural one who can communicate with the world tree and use the power of the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sons of each forest have unique abilities, and the place with the forest is their home. Individual forest sons can even communicate with all plants, and all green places have their eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Son is attached to the tree of life. When the tree of life develops to the extreme, it will grow into a tree of the world. There is only one world tree in every vast area. In this area, the world tree is equivalent to the god of the Green Son, and the son of the forest is similar to the God or the Son of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, every son of the forest carries a piece of the young leaves of the world tree. They will take the young leaves before the war, gain the power of the world tree and inspire some powerful abilities. For example, the son of the forest of the Richards team has been devastated by one force. The true strength of the team is only between the 18th and the 19th. However, in the forest environment, the power of the world tree has been obviously stimulated, and it has become so terrible. Even the veteran Sanctuary strongman Sher can't resist it, and he is killed in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussed, the three agreed that the elves would not dare to provoke again in a short time, and the third tree of life might move to the depths of the forest. The next time I fight with the elves, I am afraid I need to face more children of the forest, and similar strong ones, I must make plans early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xionpide really left them a very good legacy, which is the invisible deterrent to the Greenson plane. Elemental extraction and crystallization of toxins are clearly left to the deep shadows of the indigenous people, so when the forest was able to encircle the city steadily, the ranks of war-like trees and forest sons did not appear. It was not until Richard that they occupied a tree of life that it caused a sharp rebound in the natives. If this is not the case, if these strong players are engaged in combat from the beginning, Richard will face a more difficult situation. But this also gave the three people a new understanding of the strength of the Schumpeter family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the bloody crystals that condensed the essence of the son of the forest, the result of the final discussion of the three was to get back to the Noland auction. All three have a strong blood heritage and awakened ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially Richard, even the existing blood must be given up selectively, and no more blood is meaningless. When Richard awakened a real name, Archimonde's blood power increased greatly, and they all had some suppression on the blood of the Silver Moon Elf. Once the new blood is present, it will definitely be suppressed by Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the followers of the three subordinates, either have a strong blood ability, or there are other ways to improve their ability faster, using this blood crystal Waste, or the existing strength is not enough to absorb this blood crystal, forcibly absorbed will become very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is not very useful for three people and followers, but it does not mean that it is useless to others. On the contrary, in some noble identities, but they have not inherited the blood, or the potential heirs of the giants who have not been able to awaken the blood, the blood crystal is worthless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing this time, there is no other thing on the surface, but three people have not left, but sit silently, they all seem to have a heart, but No one has an opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Nyris couldn’t help but ask: "How is Lina’s situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After hesitated, Richard said: "The situation is still very bad. Her magic can actually be restored, but... the recovery of appearance may take a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do she know her own situation now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "I don't know, but I am worried that she will wake up. I can't stand it. Is there any other way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris looked at Agamemnon, Agamemnon pondered for a moment and said, "I There are only two ways to think of it, one is to sacrifice, to see if you can get similar grace. The other is to advance, every level of promotion after entering the sanctuary is a process of comprehensive transformation of the body to adapt to more Powerful power. In the process, the defects in the original body structure will be repaired, and the scars may be restored. In addition, perhaps the great priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple may have a solution, but It’s hopeful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, both methods took a long time, and the sacrifice was nothing more than illusory. No one is sure whether this problem can be solved. At least, in the long list that Richard has read, he has never seen such a trace of grace. But the eternal and timeless dragons have more graces, so the Nolanders have formed a habit, and once there is any problem that cannot be solved, they will instinctively pin their last hopes on the sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, Richard. When will the magic of your loss be restored?" Neris asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully perceives his own state and says, "Nothing, the loss is not too big. It can be restored to the 14th level in about a month." "Nurs nodded and looked relieved, then thought of something and said, "Yes, Richard. About Lina, I I suggest you go to ask Qi Qi, she may have some options."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can cure Lina?" Richard felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
