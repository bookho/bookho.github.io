			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that in the deepest part, the abyss and hell are connected together, countless demons and devils There is a never-ending killing there. The above knowledge comes more from the inheritance and record of other races that humans obtained when they explored the endless plane. The experience handed down by human adventurers is rare, and it exists only in the singing of the poets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the devil is in the heart, and the power of the devil comes from the head. On the continent of Noland, don't say a complete big devil's head, that is, a broken corner is worth a lot. Gordon’s tone is understated, but the head of this great devil is probably one of the most valuable collections of the Archimonde family. It was only a little bleak before the heart of the fresh demon lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a handsome young man in the command hall. It was the strange thief Seldon. This time, Richard still did not find out how he appeared. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selwon with a charming smile, but the tone is very serious and serious: "Master, Vatican's great priest is ready, sacrifice ceremony at any time It can be started. In addition, other giants have already noticed the movement on our side. The road leading to the Eternal Dragon Temple has begun to gather strong people, and there are seventeen powerful scouts. Do you want to get rid of a few?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon has already put on the armor, while finishing, he said: "No! I know that this strength is very unfavorable to us, but it is impossible to wait for other Several people are back, so let's go. What about my sword?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred handed a long sword that was not eye-catching to Gordon . This is a very old sword, the copper cast scabbard is covered with mottled rust. Except for a few unrecognizable runes on the scabbard, there is no unusual place for this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon hangs his sword on his waist and says, "Let's go, let's see the old guys who live on the sixth floor. No courage! Richard, bring the two boxes, remember to give them a float, otherwise you can't lift them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while A line of knights appeared from the entrance to the temple, and walked along the winding road to the eternal dragon temple that occupied the highest point of fauna. The dense canopy on both sides of the tree-lined road is bathed in the radiance of the colorful string moon, projecting a deep and shallow shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance from the Temple of Transmission to the Temple of Eternal Dragon is several kilometers long, but it completely leaves the temple to guard the line of sight until it goes to the special road of the Dragon Temple. However, it is two corners, more than one kilometer. But tonight this road seems to be long and endless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a team of six knights, Gotton is at the forefront, and his horse is covered almost by the thick dark black horse. Occasionally, when the four hooves step on the ground, a burning flame is occasionally ejected. This "dark moon black inflammation" has long been a symbol of Gotton, and it has also appeared in many old aristocrat nightmares of the Holy Alliance. Richard was sandwiched between Kellan and Cade, behind him. Modred is dragging at the end of the team, and is different from the quiet 'dark moon black inflammation'. 'Lava' always uses iron hoof to plan the ground, which seems a bit restless, as if the whole team is not worried about the speed of travel. Annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha rides on his armor immediately, with two large and one small boxes hanging on both sides behind him, without any disguise and disguise. His heart beats slowly and steadily, and it is obvious that a cold wave of coldness has passed over on himself and stayed on the two boxes for a long time. In the deep woods, on the uninhabited little square, and even the calm seems to have entered the building of the dream, I do not know how many pairs of eyes are staring at this seemingly thin team. And there are more people coming to hear it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the mountain, the Temple of Eternal Dragon is shrouded in pale golden light, like the temple of the gods. In the void above the main hall, the brilliance of the seven-color string moon is completely annihilated. Only a huge hourglass image is hidden, and countless bands of light woven by mysterious symbols are flying around. This is like a miraculous sight, a symbol of the opening of the Eternal Dragon Hall, which means that the highest level of sacrifice will be held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice ceremony of the Eternal Dragon Hall is divided into three levels. The more advanced the rituals, the more priests and priests will be involved, and the more grace and gift the sacrament will receive. It is said that the highest level of ritual may even directly communicate with the eternal and the dragon's body consciousness. Of course, this is just a legend. There is no family in the history of Fu Shide, including the royal family, who can successfully communicate the celestial consciousness of the eternal and time dragon. Some people have succeeded, but they chose to be secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of the sacrifice ceremony is chosen by the sacrificial person according to the sacrifice, not the higher the better. If you start the most advanced ceremony, but there are not enough sacrifices to match, it is entirely possible to call God. This is a precedent in the history of Faust. Therefore, the eternal shape of the Eternal Dragon Temple and the team of the Archimonde family, the idiot will also know that this team has enough sacrifices to hold the highest level of sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of such sacrifices can make at least one-third of the giants crazy, especially those who rank lower. It is important to know that the entire floating world may not be able to see the highest level of sacrifice in a year, but also in the royal family and the first five worlds. Archimonde, although already proved its strength with the floating island 7-3, but because of the short history of entering the vagrants for more than a year, it is still stubbornly considered by some families to be insufficient. Such an upstart, who has not yet established a firm foothold, wants to make the highest level of sacrifice, even if there is no direct conflict of interest, it is enough to cause a lot of injustice and anger. What's more, the highest level of sacrifice, the grace of God is likely to be enough to change the existing pattern of fait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the road of this kilometer is extraordinarily long, and the situation is like a full bow, it may have been so tight, it is possible to put the arrow in the next moment Shoot it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s palm is greasy and full of cold sweat, and the thick murder has already made him a little breathless. Until then, he really felt the pressure when faced with the real powerhouse. It was a natural shock brought about by the power level gap. Just as human beings looked into the endless plane, they naturally felt that the power of creation was beyond the reach. This kind of awe has nothing to do with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Calm, calm down...” Richard repeatedly said to himself in his heart, trying to keep his riding position. He dare not prepare any magic. In this subtle situation, any extra action can break the fragile balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bang, and the sound of the broken branches suddenly came from the depths of the woods. Then even Richard noticed that a figure with a black outfit began to move closer to the team. Richard immediately became nervous. In his perception, every time this person approaches a meter, the threat increases by a few points. If you are so strong, how can you break the branches, how can you hide yourself under the night? This is a temptation and a provocation. If the response is not right, then the team may be attacked immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon doesn’t seem to notice anything, it’s very relaxed, and even starts to pick up a little song that doesn’t know which plane is circulating. The tone is active and cheerful, and several high and low turns It's even a bit funny. ‘Dark moon black inflammation’ is also easy to step on the small steps, and slaps the ball for Gordon in a brisk rhythm. Seeing the back of Gotton in front, Richard’s tight nerves somehow suddenly relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow is getting closer and closer, and the posture is getting closer to the ground, such as a leopard close to the prey, and it is possible to launch a fatal blow at any time. He has been out of the shade of the forest, becoming a large, abrupt shadow on the road, so that he is approaching the team a little bit under the eyes of the public. Six meters, five meters, four meters... When Gordon passed by him, the two sides were only one meter apart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
