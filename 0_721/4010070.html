			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at this, does the enemy want to rely on the military to decide the outcome? Ender felt incredible. There is no need for a dragon master who has the advantage of being single-handed. Do you really want to rely on the army to attack the city of emerald? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ender keeps rubbing his head. His short hair is half black and half white, but his roots are erected like steel needles. Whenever he feels hard, he always has confidence in himself. However, this time it lost its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at hand is the last thing Ende wants to see. There is still a gap between the rebel and Archimonde's combat forces. Once the army is defeated, the Archimonde soldiers will flood into the Emerald City, which means a defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These warriors can't pose a threat to Ender himself, but they can attack the Magic Tower. In this narrow-scale battle in the tower, those mages are not the opponents of the soldiers, and they can be piled up by the number alone. Once he lost the aid of the Magic Tower, Ende had to escape immediately. If the action is a little slow, he can't escape under the Dragon Master's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina is not an ordinary big magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint light curtain descends from the sky, covering the entire emerald city. The magical field of the three magic towers has been fully developed. In the vast area, the power of any magic will be weakened by one or two levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde army has entered the outermost range of the Magic Tower attack. But seeing the extremely scattered formation of the soldiers, Ender hesitated again and finally did not let the magic tower attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde army’s mode of propulsion at this time is slow and strange. The scattered formation, if it encounters a large enemy force in front, is equal to sending it to the door. Go to be cut into small pieces and small pieces. However, if the Magic Tower is launched now, an attack will cover up to three teams. The Magic Tower of the Primary Magic Tower is limited and can support a limited number of attacks. Valuable magic must remain in the most critical places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Lina finally flew into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the volley of the Dragon Master, Ender did not dare to let the Magic Tower attack freely. According to past experience, the next step is to overwhelm the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suppress the magic field!" Ender pulled out his two-handed sword and jumped onto the wall and shouted. Even without his command, the wizard in the magic tower saw that the Dragon Master had already taken off, and quickly added the scope and intensity of the magical field to the maximum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina’s hands open, she must sing a spell, and suddenly there is a voice from Richard: "Wait, don't attack first. You will stay there!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Master stunned, did not understand the meaning of Richard, but still stopped the attack action, just floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange stalemate, in less than a minute, Ender’s face changed. Maintaining the magical field is also very consuming magic, and the formation of the Archimonde army is changing rapidly, and it is quickly attacking the city. The half-year-old, the sanctuary who has been through a hundred wars, was a little overwhelmed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege must be intercepted, but not him, the magic tower can not waste the attack, and it takes time to switch from the magic field to the attack state. The worst thing is that Lina hasn't taken the initiative yet, so she can't decide which area to put her in. Although the Master of the Dragon is now in the air, it is reasonable to say that it has been held down, but a Master who has not yet taken the shot, you can't figure out what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ender was awkward and almost wanted to take the initiative. Just such a hesitation, Ende found that the situation has been very critical! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard’s troops were regrouping and rushing to the wall, a huge gap, Ende finally reluctantly shouted: “All the troops meet!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of rebels rushed to the gap, trying to stop Archimonde’s army outside the city. The troops of both sides are finally strangled together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven or eight low-ranking priests of Archimonde are constantly protecting the warriors with various magical effects under great protection. The rebels did not participate in the pastor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schumpeter family lost all family priests in this plane while losing control of the plane. One of Noland's plane civil war guidelines is to not leave any pastor to the other party, even if not killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three to ten squadrons retreat 20 meters, one or two, ten to fourteen teams assault!" Licha ordered, the Chinese army more than ten large The soldiers of Tuen Mun shouted in the same voice, and at the same time, the semaphores, the magical sounds were amplified and other means were used in parallel, and the commands were transmitted to the various squadrons in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the midline warrior slowly retreats, while the two wings are counter-currently killed! The two sides were intertwined and the soldiers stumbled together. When Richard’s army formed a change, he immediately took the rebels out of the gap in the wall and formed a prominent part, surrounded by three sides! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lina feels that she has found an offensive opportunity, so she screams: "Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't move!" Richard responded harshly, and then continued to order: "Three to ten squadrons stop and maintain the front. The third, fifth, seventh, and ninth squadrons rush!! Now shrink, the sixth and ten squadrons rush! ... contraction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of Richard, the Archimonde army, which was originally dominant, surrounded the rebels and had a team from time to time. The warrior suddenly made a force, and quickly broke into the enemy's squad for a while, and then shrank back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So repeatedly, Richard’s army is like a huge grinding disc, slowly grinding and harvesting the enemy’s life. Four hundred long-bow archers still set fire, did not support the infantry of the square, but a section of the harvest sweeping the wall and exposed the small rebel forces. But because of their existence, the rebels did not dare to assemble into a dense defensive formation. High-precision ejection is a nightmare of dense formations. Arrow rain is not limited by the field of demonstration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licha!" Lina yelled again, but her request for the battle was still a sentence of "Wait!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Dragon does not move, Ender and the No. 1 Magic Tower can not have any movement, but the magic field has to maintain the maximum. Although the magic towers of the second and third magic towers occasionally launch a magical attack, the main forces of both sides have already completed the hedging and entangled together, and the magic attack is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon master in the air is only dissatisfied, but Ender is already sweating on his forehead. His face is struggling, and both rushing and not rushing are the same, which is difficult. He has to do something, or else he is really too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of Richard was extremely fine, and every assault was rushed to the most chaotic place of the rebels, leaving a bloody wound. The rebels are losing blood quickly, and it is only a matter of time before they are fully defeated. And until now, the horrible Dragon Master in the sky has not done anything. No one knows when the horrible fire and the dragon will fall from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
