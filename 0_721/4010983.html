			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Burton is not far from Yashan. If you leave from the Earl, you can reach the Black Rose Castle within five days. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sensitive period, the three high-end forces that are the core of the sacred dynasty, Miranda, came to such a place as close to Yashan, which is intriguing. To put it bluntly, it is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Richard gradually became murderous and asked: "How many troops are there with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said calmly: "The church army is 150,000, the aristocratic private army is 350,000. In addition, the two members of the Knights of the Church and the four great dynasty of the dynasty are also advancing toward the Earl of Burton. It will take a long time to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This army will not go to the Holy Alliance?" Richard sneered and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin smiled and said, "Of course, I am going to go to the Black Rose Castle. It’s just that I will start playing and I have to observe it again. I said I will definitely find a way to get rid of you. If there is a chance, then of course you can't let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "There are a lot of 500,000 troops. But now if you want to play, you can try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin laughed and said, "Now, of course it is not an opportunity, but after a while, it will not Certainly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you forcing me to give up Faro?" Richard suddenly raised a strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin smiled and said: "No! I just feel that the chance to destroy you is about to happen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When Martin’s face disappeared in the magical image, Richard frowned and meditated. He knew very well that Martin was not an empty threat, because no verbal threat would be extravagant to mobilize more than 500,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that once he is mishandled in Faro and dragged into the quagmire, the army of the sacred dynasty will really flood like a tide. Yashan collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is now returning to the Holy Alliance, but Archimonde, who is on the floating island of 3-1, has stepped on the royal family. At this moment, this position is actually very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that once Ashan’s attack is attacked, there may not be an ally in the Holy Alliance. The Anan family may send troops, but their strength is too weak in front of the entire sacred dynasty, weak to worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin is telling Richard in another way, he has seen the hesitation in Richard’s heart. And this hesitation should not have appeared in Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, all families who tried to fight the Reaper have never had any benefit in addition to the painful price. So giving up is a natural choice and the most sensible choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha temporarily collects his thoughts and goes to the palace to see no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the new palace has been roughly completed, and the palace has been re-decorated. However, in some details, you can also see a trace of new construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was taken directly into the main hall of the palace and waited here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, I decided to come in from the side door. She had just finished bathing, wrapped herself in a bath towel and walked out. She came to Richard and sat down. The cross-legged legs are white and long and tempting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to admit that she is indeed a great beauty after ignoring the insane and bloodthirsty character. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncertainly looking at Richard, said with no expression: "Is it for the reaper?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Yes! It’s a little hard to support by my own strength. So I need help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No double The eyebrows rose and changed the legs of the frame. From Richard's point of view, the moment she exchanged her legs, just to see a hidden secret scene. Seems to see it, and does not seem to see it. Such a small movement, so that Richard's heartbeat suddenly accelerated a few shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard strongly calmed down and said seriously: "I hope that His Majesty can suppress the sacred dynasty in the name of the Holy Alliance. I have just contacted St. Martin, knowing that the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Church have mobilized 500,000 troops to my territory. Entering. Once I lost too much in the war with the Reaper, the Holy Tree Dynasty is likely to declare war immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing reveals a look for Richard Unclear smile, said: "You look for Saint Martin, but also ask for help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, did you find him first, and then you were threatened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns, faintly feels the atmosphere It just got a little bit wrong at the very beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with a hard slap: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, a smile, said: "Since this is the case, then I can tell you my decision now. My decision is... don't help you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was amazed, and then my eyebrows wrinkled and looked at it indefinitely. He and his life have been killed and killed together, and they have also passed through the eternal vortex. It can even be said that the relationship is closer and stronger than the real lover. But now, when Archimonde faced the crisis, he was unwilling to help him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Richard needs is that she came forward to restrict the sacred dynasty, lest Archimonde be threatened by war at the weakest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had an idea in his heart. Didn’t he also see that he was unwilling to give up Faro, so he forced it in the same way as St. Martin. he? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I stood up and said faintly: "Richard, Archimonde’s bloody journey is so magnificent, not only ours. There is hatred between me. Now I think other floating island nobles will be very happy to see you being cleared again. If Archimonde lets me see the opportunity, I will not mind if I am with you and you. The family is all sent to hell. Of course, at that time, if you are willing to compromise, I can't consider letting you go. For example..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Indefinitely lifted a leg, stepped on Richard's thigh, and said: "...say, kiss my boots again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no boots on the indefinite legs, not even a piece of cloth. A leg that is so white and snowy is placed in front of your own eyes, and no one may mind kissing a boot that does not exist at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard knows that these words are not just a joke. She said that she can really do it. Now, instead of finding an ally, Richard has harvested two terrible enemies who are watching. His mood at the moment is as gloomy as the sky in the ice floes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." Richard said calmly, lifted the undecided legs, put them aside, and then left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity kept at the door of the dormitory. After he personally sent Richard to leave, he returned to the side of No., and asked, "Why, why don't you help him?" It's not difficult, you don't even need a formal announcement, you can do a small message. After so many years, you finally have the object of mating, which is really hard to come by. So I think it can be better for him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing gently vomited and said: "I originally wanted to help him, but...he made me feel bad." Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" The turbidity is also very doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he first found someone else." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the turbidity does not know how to evaluate it. This is indeed a reason, some ridiculous, but absolutely sufficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the floating island with a heavy heart. He didn't understand why things suddenly became like this, but at least it was a bit of a benefit, that is, let him know in advance what the situation he was facing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he returned to the study, the attendant Master sent a letter from the Millennium Empire with the most urgent and important double mark on the envelope, corner On the top there is the badge of the Prince of Tumen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately knew that the letter should be news about the dark side of the world. It seems that the Millennium Empire has inherited the legacy of some elf empire, and the heritage is indeed different from the other two empires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although facing the threat of the reaper, the fate of Su Helun is more important. Richard eagerly opened the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter was written by Mex and the content is very simple. She said that after searching, she did get some clues about the dark side of the world, and also mentioned a road that could lead to the dark side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These materials are not not handed over to Richard, but there is a condition that Richard must be responsible for what he did before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Micks asked at the end of the letter: "His Royal Highness, how are you feeling now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Reading this letter, Richard suddenly laughed and laughed. It seemed that the night of the construction of Mex was a bit too hot, so that the beauty has always hated it. The result was finally she was waiting for the opportunity to discover Richard's death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has no time to entangle with Mexus, so he immediately replied, saying that as long as Mex sent the information, his mood would be It will be very good, nothing can be talked about. But now I have to fight the Reaper, but I don’t have time to go to the Millennium Empire to accompany Mex. If Mex wants anything, then come to Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee took the envelope, let the attendant pass it to Mex, and then gave Ellie a new order, and the army of the holy tree dynasty was The news of the collection of Earl of Burton told her to let her shrink the line of defense and defend her. But once there is any conflict, let go and start without any concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Richard contacted Black Gold, let him keep the dark blue, and fully produced the parts and bobbins required by Vulcan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrange everything, Richard is ready to return to Faro. At this time, the attendant Master rushed in, and the original reply from Mex was actually there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter, there are only two words in the letter: "Wait for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Ricton suddenly took a look, I didn’t expect Micks’ response to be so fast. However, Richard certainly can't stay in Nolan's stupid and other Mex. He has already told the attendant that the wizard is ready to bring the magic materials and materials of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of preparation, Richard took a team of knights and sent them to the Black Rose Castle, ready to travel to Faro from here. But when Richard went to the front of the transmission array, he suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
