It is rare to be a great magician at his age. His eyes were sharp like an eagle, and he instantly fell on Richard. He shouted coldly: "Stand up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha instinctively felt the hostility of the other party, so the eyes were slightly Dew chill and stop. Richard’s gaze also fell on the young sergeant, while detecting his strength while waiting for his following. Under the watchful eye of Richard, the strength of this young sergeant gradually unveiled. He is a great magician around the thirteenth level. His magic is pure and honest, and he is biased towards elemental strength. Moreover, Richard felt a similar temperament from him, calm and precise, which is often the temperament that the builders will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young sergeant stopped in front of Richard and looked him up and down several times. He asked coldly and arrogantly: "You are the Lee of the Archimonde." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not in a good mood now, and with his own determination, he said faintly: "I am not interested in answering your question, let Open!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young sergeant’s face changed dramatically, and the face looked awkward and distorted at once, but he became more arrogant and sneered and said: “I am royal The most outstanding student of Master Luno Master, Feng Ster! I heard that you claim to be the future sect of the sect? It’s ridiculous! A little guy who hasn’t held a press conference yet dares to boast that it’s the future Master? Do you know what a holy builder is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another young man said loudly: “The Archimonde guys are not all Will only brag up the nouveau riche!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Archimonde is a guy who only has long muscles and does not have a long brain. How can he understand what constitutes Even if it is installed? It’s Gordon, isn’t it being fooled into the ectopic face, and can’t come back forever?” Another person is also screaming out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this guy is still carrying a knife! I have never seen a magician still need a knife!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ridicule is endless, but Richard doesn’t seem to hear anything, just faintly said to Vonster: “Let’s go!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster’s face was a bit greener. He glanced at the long knife behind Richard and put on the most sarcasm sneer, saying: “I’m the first time I’ve seen the builder’s knife back. Is it a noble builder, do you have to put your knife on the back to make it cool? Although I heard that Archimonde’s taste is not good, I never thought it would be so bad. In addition, I have to Remind you that this knife is really not good! Or spend more money to buy a good knife to carry it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, Vonster Reaching out and trying to habitually point a few points on Richard's chest, just as he usually taught a magic apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint sneer on the lips, and the right hand fingers couldn’t help but start the activity. As long as Vonster's fingers touched his clothes, Richard would cut off the finger that offended him in an instant! Losing a finger is a fatal blow to the builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster’s hand has reached halfway, suddenly there is a chill in the bottom of his heart, his head is numb, his muscles are stiff, and he does all the movements. Not out! This is a sense of danger, and judging from this strong feeling, it is a deadly danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonster's face was pale, and he tried his best to control the trembling of his right hand. He no longer looked at his face, put his right hand down, and then looked at Richard with amazement. For a moment, it was not clear whether the danger came from this guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Fengster and suddenly smiled: "Your perception is quite keen, but unfortunately the courage is too small, the eyesight is not good..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t finished talking, and suddenly there is an exclamation next to him: “extermination!!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A violent wind rushed to the face, a strong and tall young man rushed to Richard in front of him, his eyes smoldering, and asked evilly: "Who are you?! Why is Schenkel's 'extinction' in your hand? What about her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vonster stood aside and his face was blue and red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but look at the long knife on Richard’s back. Under careful observation, he only slightly saw the difference in 'extinction'. The faint and fierce feeling made him burst into chills. The long knife ‘extinction’ is famous for its legendary level. It is a precious thing in any family. It’s no wonder that Richard’s irony is not good enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extinction is a weapon for the killer. The atmosphere is completely introverted. In the eyes of those who do not have eyesight, it is a plain long knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fengster, not recognizing extinction is tantamount to being a loud slap on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sight of Richard fell on the strong young man, looking up and down carefully several times before and then asked: "The Bear Peters "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man is very strong, and the vindictiveness has flowed on the double fists. He screamed: "I will ask again, why is Sinclair’s knife in your hand? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the two Knights of the Knights around Richard, he would have already started. Of course, the strength of the two Knights of the Knights is not in his eyes, but behind the Knights of the Temple stands the Eternal Dragon Hall. Not to mention him, Dahio, the head of the Schumpeter family, is not here to dare to the Knights of the Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the young man again and suddenly smiled and said, "I don't dare to start here, so don't stop my way, get away." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You!" The young man’s teeth squeaked, the tighter the fists, the more the knuckles became cyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knights around Richard were taking a step forward and shouted: "Mr. Richard is a VIP of the Eternal Dragon Hall. Don't stop the road! Otherwise, Ferdinand Adults will go to your family to visit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster and the young Schumpeter are equally angry, but have to get to the side of the road. It doesn't matter if the little ruin of the order of the vassal, but if it angers the eternal dragon temple, they will inevitably be severely punished by the family. It’s okay to swear, but you have to be right. If it is so provoked that it can not be provoked, it is completely stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the young Schumpeter has recognized Richard’s identity, and his eyes are filled with anger and grievances. When Richard passed by in front of him, he suddenly shouted: "Richard! If you have the ability, you will hide in the floating world for the rest of your life! As long as you dare to leave the volcanic step, my McCa will kill you!!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said no to his head: "Childish. If there is a chance, let's see it on the battlefield! I will let you all of you, Peter Peter, can't come back, just like Sinclair. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mcca stunned, and then his face changed greatly, and it was more and more iron-green, and the eyes of infinite blame were stabbed on the back of Richard! He had wanted to get the news of Sinclair very much. Now he did get it, but he didn't dare to rush to find Richard. In any case, since Richard dared to sway through the city with Sinclair's long knife, regardless of the level, McCain intuitively felt that he was not his opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although, McCain himself is a fifteenth-level warrior and is known as an outstanding figure in the young generation of Schumpeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster suddenly said to Richard’s back: "Richard! Three days later, my teacher, the master of the Royal Architect Luno Master The press conference is also the official launch conference for my official promotion! If you want to check it out, I can send you an invitation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Interest. Three days later, my own assembly conference will be held," Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fonster's pupil contracted, biting his teeth, snoring and squeezing out a blessing from his teeth: "I hope someone will go to your body." The conference!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden appearance of Richard, apparently out of the expectations of the people on the floating island 7-2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the transmission array, he met several face-to-face people on the head, including step-riding knights, young people with aristocratic clothes, and Can't see the person of the calendar. When Richard appeared, they were obviously stunned and shouted: "Licha! How is Richard? Richard is back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a stunned, amazed, panic, and even two people still handed their arms to the waist. One of them ran to the floating island, obviously who to report to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, Richard has seen all their expressions and reactions in their eyes. These people kept on doing nothing in front of the transmission line and couldn’t stand it. It was obviously guarded here. Moreover, after recognizing the identity of Richard, these people actually showed fierce light in their eyes. They only saw the two Knights of the Temple, which appeared behind Richard, and did not dare to do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there has been some understanding of the situation on the floating island, Richard is still somewhat surprised and surprised by the embarrassment of these people. The raging anger was already at the bottom of Richard's heart, but his face was expressionless and calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard strode to the floating island, but was stopped by these few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slow! This is the floating island of the Archimonde family, but you can't just enter it." One of them said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Richard Archimonde."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are Li Check the young master..." When a person just said half of it, he was stopped by his companion with his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stepping knight with armor is one step forward, his hand has gripped the hilt, his eyes are staring at Richard, and then he screams: "Who I know that Master Richard has died in the turmoil of time! Who are you, dare to pretend to be Master Li? Hurry, otherwise, I will kill you immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the knight, and suddenly said, "I know you, you are Charles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
