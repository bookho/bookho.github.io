			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Richard, the blue light flashed away, and the moonlight fell, swept the body of the blood, and then fell into the knife. The bloody teeth stood up and stood for a whole second. The body suddenly split into two pieces and fell down on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf holy knife moonlight, the more it reaches the dark area, the more prominent the value. Even in the place where the rules are distorted, the two attributes of the moonlight's never-damaged and extreme sharpness can still be effective, which is the basis of the artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, the Holy Sword only left a property that never ruined, and the sharpness has fallen to the level of ordinary weapons, and all other attributes are absent. The ruling is even worse, and all the attributes have disappeared. Instead, there is an attribute of 'destructive destruction'. Richard even suspected that it was the ruling of the current ruling and the short knife in the hands of the people in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easy to understand. After all, the ruling is the sacred creation of the eternal and the dragon of time. In places where the eternal and timeless dragons are incompatible, the ruling is subject to additional suppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the moonlight is more and more unpredictable. Especially when Gotton got the moonlight, most of them were not as easy as he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the strong man and the bloody teeth fell, the pub was dead, and no one dared to move. Everyone is staring at Richard's knife, but now they have no greed in their eyes, and the rest is full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can get out of the knife, and can easily return to the knives, indicating that the rule control has far exceeded them. With the horror attribute of moonlight, Richard is killing all the people in the pub, I am afraid it will take a minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how good things are, you have to have a life to get it. In places like dark areas, these powerful people who were not afraid of death became corrupt and afraid of death. Perhaps they have survived unexpectedly, and they have wiped out most of their bravery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sits quietly, in the void in the sky that no one can see, the two light spots are drifting out of the brawny and bloody teeth, flying into In the body of Richard, he attached to the three tetrahedrons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two souls are unexpectedly powerful, and it seems that not only can they get a lot of rules from it, but maybe it is possible to develop two new five-step structures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that it’s not time to study these, Richard has sealed the two souls in three tetrahedrons, waiting for the next change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman came out of the kitchen at the moment, holding a large wooden barrel in her hand and a black rag that made people want to vomit. She went to the body of the bloody tooth, threw all the viscera scattered in the ground into the barrel, and then wiped the blood on the ground with a rag. When the rag is soaked, the blood will be screwed into the bucket and the blood will be wiped with a wrung rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman sighs while working: "It’s a lang fee! With so much blood, you can cook a pot of soup. Hey, boy, when you kill." Pay attention to it, just take a small hole and you can't use the dagger to divide the body. You are happy, but we have fewer rations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very reprimanded by her, especially after seeing the rag, she was even more afraid to drink the soup on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked at the people in the pub who stood still like statues and snorted: "What to do? You, you, and Those meats help me clean up, the old rules, one spoonful of soup per person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub immediately recovered his anger, and several people who were picked up by the woman hid The body of the strong man was sent to the kitchen. Even the two broken hands and feet have not been let go. The two men who were cut off by Richard's hands and feet were shrunk into the corner of the pub. What is strange is that their wounds are no longer bleeding, and they don't look painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked up at Richard and said, "Old Bar really didn't misread you, but he still underestimated your power. There is still something else. Next, you don't want to kill any more. Our town is so fast that people are almost at the limit. If people continue to go down, they may not be able to maintain the order of light curtains. At that time, all of us will die."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they don't want to eat me, I won't kill them." Richard replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you don't eat them, it's not bad, how can someone dare to mess with you? Right, your bowl of soup is still clean, at least There is no human flesh. You better drink it, there is no room for provocation. Many newcomers are just like you at the beginning, and haven't eaten anything since then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded, took the soup bowl, took a sip, then put it down and savored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bowl of very common broth, not to mention the taste. However, as soon as this soup entered the abdomen, it immediately turned into a pure energy, and Richard's physical strength and magical power increased accordingly. Richard drank another swig of wine, which looked like a beer, but in fact it was extremely alcoholic and bitter and embarrassing. However, like this broth, the belly will turn into energy and then transform into physical strength and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Righton has a different look, he did not expect to eat and drink can actually increase physical strength and magic. It seems that this pub is not simple, this woman is not simple. And in the dark, perhaps this is the only way to increase physical strength and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a careful experience, Richard found that what was eaten and drank was not completely converted into energy, or two-thirds of the residue remained in the abdomen. The physical strength and magical power that has been transformed are also slowly losing. Although the rate of loss is very slow, Richard is expected to lose completely in ten days, but this is not a long-term solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately analyzed the loss of physical strength and magic, and found that this is still a phenomenon under the twisting rules. Only when he has a considerable degree of control over the twisting rules, at least half of the rules must be controlled within the sixteen rules to avoid the loss of physical strength and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, Richard knows why people in the town have almost no reserves of grudges and magic. Their control over the rules is obviously far less than that of Richard, so the rate of loss will be faster than that of Richard. Gather in the pub to eat and drink, not to restore, but to maintain the need for survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard closed his eyes, some people in the pub whispered, "How can Norland come out so powerful?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small voice! You have been here for too long! I heard that Norland has recently had several outstanding big men. I know, my message can be It’s less than a hundred years of new news.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Nonsense, you have been here for more than three hundred years!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible? I was still exploring the void one hundred years ago! You are so confused..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Richard finally understood that the problem related to time is the core of the quarrel. And now he finds that his feelings about the passage of time are particularly clear, which may be related to the time rule that he inadvertently touched when he was awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer cares what the people in the pub say, but concentrates on drinking the wine, eating the food, and leaving the woman with a very clean glass and Empty bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the pub sighed in disappointment, and there was only a small glass of wine in front of most of them, probably not enough to drink. Only a few people can put a little broth in front of them, which is a spoonful of ingredients, and it is clear that you can see the bottom of the bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is full of food and drink. Although most of the food and wine were not fully absorbed, they also added a small half of their strength and magic. This surprised Richard. If he completely controlled the twisting rules of the dark area, wouldn't he say that this meal would make him fill the magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then smiled bitterly. No matter which plane you are in, it is almost impossible to completely control the rules. Even in Faro, Richard defeated the Reaper and redeemed hundreds of millions of souls, slowly controlling the rules of the entire plane. The memories and experiences of hundreds of millions of souls are also part of the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even harder to control the twisting rules in such a dark area. Whether Richard is in control of the space is extremely deep, and time has begun to be involved, thus establishing a stable and accurate coordinate system and anchor points, he is also impossible to achieve such a high speed of analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the woman who was still busy back and forth: "What about the old Bar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He went out to hunt. It is estimated that it will take two days to get back. You can come back and see it in two days!" said the woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting? Is there still prey on this wasteland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. Occasionally unlucky enough to be sent to the empty beast here. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you will be able to run one or two. Of course, most of the time he is empty-handed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He asked again: "Who else can go hunting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
