Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "According to the ancient tradition of the Master, you lost to me in the magic showdown with life as a bet, then your life. It belongs to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Sandro wants to talk, Richard raises his hand to stop him and continues to say, "I know you want to say You can give up life immediately, but before I say this, I want to ask you to think seriously. Does it make sense? You are willing to give up the greatest dream of a mage and give up the infinite endless wonder of the magical world. Give up the possibility of touching the gods one day? Even further, to break away from this plane and try to explore the mysteries of time and planes? These should be the true pride and persistence of a mage!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru listened completely, and he had never heard of anything mentioned by Richard. Savor but deeply consistent with the Master should have the spirit. Touch the secrets of the gods? Even Sandru, who is a necromancer, has never thought so boldly. And Richard even painted a further prospect for him, that is, the plane and time! Sander doesn't even think that these can be explored. But Richard said it was so natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means a nonsense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, in the eyes of Sandru, Richard is now like a mountain range, even though the necromancer is looking for it and seeing the peak of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sentences of Richard are very simple, but the meaning is to directly indicate the two future paths of the development of the Master, and it is possible to go on a very distant future. path of. This is by no means a reflection of Richard's ability, because he is now only a nine-level magician. But this means that the magical inheritance behind Richard has gone far beyond the peak of magic that Shand knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is natural, and the inheritance of dark blue is one of the top inheritance of magic even in Noland. In the dark blue, some of the well-known magic knowledge can be produced in the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... are you all true?" Sandro trembled and asked a question that he knew was very stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say?" Richard smiled and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru’s excited face flushed, but after a while he sat down and said, "But... I am a necromancer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He understands what he means and says, "If I didn't see you as a true mage, I wouldn't promise you the magic matchup. I won’t use the book that the artifacts carry in the beginning.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra is stunned, then raises his head and slowly stands up, finally making up his mind and asking "So what do you need me to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked aside and said: "I am looking for supreme power, this power is strong, At least beyond the limits of the world. In this process, I need your unreserved power, and you need to execute every command and request as soon as necessary, instead of asking why. For the battlefield Take control, I am confident on anyone, so you just have to trust my decision. And help me. Cheng Zhong, I believe that what you are doubting and what you are asking will be answered one by one. Maybe by that time, you will find that the unknown has become more, but I can help you to get rid of the bondage of the world. Explore more! As for the back, there is still a long road that I don't even know. Although this process will be very long, it is the charm of the magical meaning that our mage devotes to life and research to explore, isn't it? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the description of Richard, Sandro's eyes are getting brighter and brighter, and the blueprint of the vast and magical world of magic seems to be unfolding. He looked at the words and stopped looking at his own Richard. He fixed his mind and said, "The last thing, Lord Richard, I must remind you that I am a necromancer. In the eyes of the gods, The Necromancer is a heresy that needs to be sent to the firearms. There is no second possibility. Because we are involved in the soul of the dead, and that is the field where the gods do not allow others to intervene. So if I join your team, once I am People find that you may be included in the hunting list of the major churches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said, "Do not worry! I even have demons. Dare to cooperate, let alone the Necromancer? As for the gods, I have never planned to deal with them, and I am not afraid of their pursuit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandru nodded Nodding, looking serious, and kneeling down, said: "If this is the case, then I am willing to follow you, to find the supreme power! You will gain my loyalty, magical power and an undead army." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say , Sandro made under oath has a magic power. This vow is the most binding vow that the lower-level wizard can find. Although it is not as effective as the magic slavery contract, if it violates, Sandru will also pay the price of falling a whole level. So the higher his level, the stronger the bond of vows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "The body is yours, I hope that it will take a long time, and your fixed summoner will have a stronger one. Black Warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won't be disappointed," said Sandru. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, in the course of the research, if you have the magic material you need, remember to give me a list, and I have a stock of magic materials in my hand." After that, Richard left the room of Sandru and let the anxious necromancer begin to study the call of the Black Warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the door, Richard saw the sands standing there, looking at him with a smile. Richard hired, so the sand was followed by Richard on the second floor and into his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just closing the door, Liu Sha said: "I think it is a pity that you don't be a pastor. Whether you really believe or not, rely on it. When you develop the believer's ability, you can at least mix a big priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a slip of sand into his arms and said, "You If I dare to laugh at me again, I will rape/rape you immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is impossible." The hoarse voice of the sand is always so tempting. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyebrows of Richard erected and said, "Do you think I am afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper body of the drifting sand leaned back slightly and raised his beautiful chest. Then he said, "Of course, you are not afraid, but I will try to cooperate with you. How can this be considered strong?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Richard was mad at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly shallow smile, look up and kiss gently on Li’s lips, then say: “In fact, there is no need to wait until the day before the return, as long as the day You really have the confidence to bring us back. It can be done at that time. I will... Resist all the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a bit, Richard’s body The stocks are ignited by the sands! The arm that ran the sand was getting tighter and tighter, asking: "So before I have confidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
