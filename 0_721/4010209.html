			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard’s pro-two thousand cavalry went on the way, all the way North, straight to the Iron Triangle Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Triangle Empire Frontier Legion An infantry regiment of four thousand people collapsed. However, Richard was not interested in chasing and killing the army. Instead, he marched forward and swept through the territory of the Empire at a speed of 200 kilometers per day. Within a week, he defeated a private army of a count, three viscounts and seven barons, sweeping over a dozen noble castles, and then went away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire reaction was considered to be rapid. The first time the 3,000 iron riders were tempted to chase after them, and the two integrated corps were mobilized. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was that when he was about to escape the territory of the Iron Triangle Empire, Richard suddenly turned his head and turned to the empire's Papan Valley with the three thousand iron horses he followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the First World War, the Iron Horse, which the Empire has always been proud of, was completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chayang went long, and the two rear-editing regiments were sitting on several times, but they did not dare to chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one day, Salenwell heard about the war and vomited blood, and he was seriously ill. The three thousand iron riders were also the elite troops under his name. The battle was directly dispatched by the emperor's department. He did not know beforehand, and even the on-site commanding power was not controlled by the generals of his faction. Even though Sharonville knew very well that even if his general had commanding power, he would be defeated by Richard, but it was so clearly swayed by the political opponents inside the empire that he could not swallow this breath. This time, the shackles made Saranwei angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the enemies of the empire in the empire are beginning to be eager to move. Li Shilongtu has accused Saranwell of several incompetent battles, repeated defeats and losses. Military power. Although Li Shilongtu himself did not perform well in the war with the dragons, he was at least able to attack the city and win and lose, not as ugly as Saulville lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire is now fully aware of the threat of Richard, after all, no matter how the aristocrats accuse Sarlenville, it is more for political purposes. They are very aware of the strength of the Royal Highness, and they know that it may be even worse to change the individual. Then the upper empire began to discuss and wait for the South and the levy after the end of the war between the East and the West. But Salenwell knew that the war was probably not related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this unparalleled manner, Richard declared his return, and then quietly and quietly left in an afternoon. After this war, Richard believed that the nobles in the Sequoia Kingdom should become much more honest, and the passing fee would not be less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving, Richard took a dozen of specially-made magical rides on the mother's nest. The nature of all aspects of this magical ride has been comprehensively enhanced, completely overwhelming the mount that the Bear Peter family has specially cultivated for the bears of the town. Looking at the Holy Alliance, they are also considered to be the first-class mounts of the ordinary knights. Moreover, the re-created magic riding service life spans ten years instead of the original three years. This makes the mount structure loaded on them more meaningful. In addition to the magic ride, Richard also transferred six Archimonde fighters and stepping knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only unpleasant thing is that the delivery fee for the magic ride is as much as the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Noland, Richard had another six knights. Counting four in the Greenson plane, Richard now has a full team of two knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was very extravagant and did not rush to return to the Greenson plane, but stayed on the floating island for one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This night, Richard entered Archimonde’s family cemetery and went all the way to the crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top, there are six Archimondes who have awakened their real names. Richard still remembers that that night, Gordon sat on a tombstone, spoke a lot to himself, and taught his own secret sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although now, in addition to the disillusionment of the fourth string of the blue moon, the other swords of the Gordons are somewhat plausible. I also need to examine myself to slowly experience it. The moves he made in the crisis several times were more dragged by the force of the crescent moon than the initiative. To really play the power of the secret sword, it still takes a long way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked around the crater and finally selected a position and marked it. This is the highest position of the entire Akmon family cemetery, even higher than the six tombstones. This is where Richard is scheduled for Ilani. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the top of the volcano, Richard looked around, here is an independent space, the magma inside the crater rolled, Richard did not doubt if he dared to jump If you go in, it will be turned into ashes immediately. And the volcanic passage does not seem to be closed, as if it could lead to another unknown space. It’s just that Richard’s current strength is not enough to cross the lava and go to the other end to find out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up again, the dome was a rolling dark red, not knowing where the light came from. The flipped dark red has been seen for a long time, but it makes people feel involuntarily in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde family cemetery must inevitably hide a lot of secrets. But who can stand in the foot of the floating world, who has no secret? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sitting at the volcanic crater. He intended to indulge his thoughts and consider some things. After a while, he naturally entered the state of deep meditation. This time, the blood of Archimonde in Richard was exceptionally clear, and the blood of the elf was obviously suppressed and blurred beyond the magic star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a little bit of starburst in the body, but there are a lot of dark red fire clouds that have never been seen before. It may be due to the influence of the family cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t think much, he had just entered the state of meditation, he just swayed his consciousness and captured what it was. Those dark red fire clouds are filled with violent and violent energy, which is better than the second-order star. However, the power contained in it was too violent. When Richard's consciousness touched the fire cloud, he immediately felt the pain of burning, and he was so painful that he grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this kind of burning, but let him feel a touch of familiarity and kindness, it seems that it is not that unbearable. Richard’s thoughts, like every meditation, touched the fire cloud into the body. As soon as the fire cloud enters the body, the energy inside is instantly scattered into the blood of Akmon, making the melt in the blood veins even hotter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awareness of Richard once again swayed and caught a cloud of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, throughout the meditation process, Richard did not deliberately, but arbitrarily swayed consciousness. Consciousness is like a fish line. Every time you swing, no matter where you are, you will inevitably bring back a red cloud. And the number of fire clouds around Richard is increasing, and it will not be able to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Richard also discovered that it was not his luck that was particularly good, but whenever the consciousness was swayed, the clouds of fire that represented chaos and bursts would rely on his own consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, I don’t know how long it took, and Richard suddenly shocked the whole body, ended his meditation and slowly opened his eyes. At this moment, his magic finally climbed to the fourteenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic breaking through the bottleneck, the blood of Archimonde in the body of Richard is gradually warming up, and it is close to boiling in the blink of an eye! Richard only felt that the whole body was too hot and it seemed to be in the fire. But the strange thing is that it is so hot, so high temperature, but not as unbearable as imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volcanic magma also swelled up, and the black rock pieces, like the loss of gravity, floated out of the magma and slowly floated into the air. One of them happened to float in front of Richard. When Licha felt a move, he suddenly opened his mouth and spit out a nearly transparent flame, hitting the black rock. The black rock was melted immediately by the flame, and a transparent hole appeared in an instant, and a drop of dark melt was still dripping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Black Rock quietly, only a moment later to understand that the scene of the horror was actually from his own hands. Not waiting for him to be astonished, suddenly a string of long symbols emerged from Richard's Akmon blood. The string of symbols is almost invisible to the end, except for the first paragraph that presents a dazzling and clear golden red, and the back is extremely faint and cannot be distinguished. When Richard's consciousness touched a small piece of golden red symbol, it naturally understood its meaning: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diss Mason...meaning destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that this was the beginning of his real name. Awakening the real name means that you have mastered the power to touch the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of magical roads, but at the beginning they did not hesitate to choose the direction of the first killer, thus showing the ability to sacrifice. It seems that there may be factors that are potentially affected by the unwound real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the long, unawakening part of his real name, Richard suddenly thought, one day, who is going to compare with the mountain and the sea? Is the name longer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Richard can't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a short period of joy and ease, Richard began to feel the hidden turmoil in his body. That kind of power is deeply hidden in the blood of Archimonde, such as the reddish rock, which seems to have no temperature, but once it is put on, it will be burned immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand and looked at it. A fireball emerged from the heart of Richard's hand, and the fireball circled, but it did not condense. With Richard's current control, the control of the third-level fireball is like an arm. But this fireball is very different from the fireball made up of ordinary magic. The color is obviously dark red, and there is a smudge of dark color flowing inside, like a rolling magma. This fireball is much thicker and thicker than a normal fireball, and it has a strong sense of substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a wave and popped the palm of his hand. The fireball slowly flew out dozens of meters away, and it exploded into a dark red fire wave, which waved around like a wave, and then slowly fell. Most of the flames fell into the crater. There were still a few smoldering fires hanging like a liquid on the stone wall of the crater. It stuck to the stone wall and burned for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee put his hands in his pocket and stood by the crater, looking down at the lava that was pouring underneath. At this time, his mood is also in two worlds, one side is lava and the other side is deep ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
