			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine of the Holy City is the tallest and most magnificent building in the city. At the top of the temple stands a spire with a height of 100 meters. The whole body is made of metal. The surface is covered with fine and complicated lines. It is very ingenious. If a master craftsman sees this spire, he will be shocked. Because this tower has exceeded the existing craftsmanship of Nolande's human beings, so huge, the details are so delicate, and when they are put together, it is a miracle. Perhaps Norland will have human craftsmen to create this. The precision of the metal components, but there are not many people at this level of craftsman, want to cast such a huge tower, I am afraid that everyone will have to work together for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minaret is a gradual convergence of the four-corner tip, black and dark, and occasionally a ray of light flows through the lines, although there is still a considerable distance from the battlefield, but if The strong people of the sanctuary can see the existence of the minaret, but from Asrius to Richard, there is not much attention to the minaret, but it is regarded as a landmark in the holy city. There are more than a dozen buildings in the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, as the three gods continue to chanting spells, their power is constantly flowing through the aura into the round table in front of them, in front of them Each of them is a screen of light condensed, flashing a large piece of information composed of mysterious words, and the three gods turn a blind eye to the information on the screen, because the text does not belong to any known system. In fact, they can't distinguish between reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spire is actually much more than just seen. It has a fairly long part that runs through the shrine and goes deep into the underground hall. The end of the minaret seems to be A complex machine, like the root of a steel giant tree, is divided into countless long and short branches, and ten meters below it is a huge metal round table up to tens of meters, the surface There are also a lot of mysterious words engraved on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground of the temple is a very grand and magnificent temple, nearly 100 meters high, and the square is hundreds of meters. Such a magnificent space is actually built by hand, its architecture The level of the dwarf, even the most stable dwarf, is also covered with dense lines on the walls, the scorpions and the floor of the temple. As the Three Gods continue to inject power, there are several lines in the underground hall. Bright, and the light continues to extend, and finally several of them continue into the tower of the metal spire, while the other few are just scattered down, all the way into the metal round table in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a low roar in the hall, and it began to vibrate slightly, and a few dimly lit red lights were lit up, allowing people to faintly see the outline of the temple. The bottom of the spire at the top of the temple suddenly moved, then slowly rotated. Sinking, the metal branches above are constantly undulating and undulating, the lower round table rotates at the same time, and the top cover opens in an ingenious spiral way, revealing a dark red viscous fluid inside, flashing red light. The branches that hang down above are unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roots of the minaret are finally immersed in the metal round table, and then eight metal grippers are ejected from the edge of the round table, buckled on the tower root, and then locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the temple, the metal tower gently trembles, and the outer shell of the surface opens like a petal, like a black long-tailed iris. The tower spires bloom like a flower, and a huge black crystal supported by three tiny metal arms rises from the inside, and then a little light in the depths of the crystal begins to shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the temple, the three gods are sitting on the ground, everyone is sweating, pale as if they have just been seriously ill, but they are all heart No sideways, just staring at the magical image on the round table, just a shadowy day-to-day look is even more tense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the battlefield, Richard has just ordered the followers of the chasing Dragon Star to return, only let Zonghu and Twilight continue to track, looking for opportunities to assassinate the Dragon Star, In him, the light of the magic is constantly shining, and the sand and the necros surrounds Richard. One by one, the gods fall on him. Rain does not know what Longxing has done for himself, but he can I clearly felt that I had a strange power on my body. It is so clear, not only Richard, but also the followers around me can feel it, but no one can distinguish its attributes, even the sand, Nai You and Lina can't do it either, but no matter what kind of power it is, the Dragon Star will definitely not have any good intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Liu Sha and Nai You are trying to get rid of this power, but the magic of the past is like a sinking sea, and there is no reaction, the power Still in accordance with his own rhythm, pulsing in Richard's body, let alone being expelled, even weakening can not be done, so many gods in the past, its pulsating rhythm is not in chaos, and Liusha and Naiyou have all able to The use of the repelling and purification of the gods have been used, and even the gain and treatment-related magic have been tried one by one, but they can not affect that power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard himself is the clearest one, the force is running in his body according to the established lines and rhythms, and will not be disturbed by other forces. Or hinder, even Richard's true talent is difficult to capture its traces, only when it passes some places, can capture a little incomplete data, but the data is not from the power itself, but by it A little bit of influence belongs to Richard's own magic or blood energy. Real talent can only track this mysterious power by recording and analyzing the changes in Richard's own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden movement in the heart of Richard. This power does not seem to exist in this world, but in another different time and space, but it is locked with Richard in a way that he simply cannot understand. It is ridiculous, but it can explain the current situation. If the force exists in another world, it will not be expelled by the sand and the gods. It is just such a mysterious power, how can it be the dragon star? Driven by, its purpose is for what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just thought of it here, suddenly the whole body was like being drenched by a piece of ice water, almost frozen in an instant, he turned his head at the fastest speed, sight Just caught the bright light on the distant horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black crystal on the tower of the temple has been completely lit, and the milky white light inside is thick and thick, as it is, it is flowing out of the crystal bit by bit. Then gather into a thick strip of light, and continue to extend forward, the speed is slow and fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of kilometers away, almost all the hair was erected in an instant, his eyes were widened to the extreme, and even the corners of his eyes were Cracked, but he didn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the call for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Richard did not encounter a crisis of life and death, but none of them was so clear and clear. Richard only felt that he was hanging at this moment. The death row on the gallows can feel that the noose is tightening a little bit, and clearly shows the process of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, many followers have also changed, they also perceive the terrible light, as long as it is photographed, it must be the soul Desolation, in an instant, all the followers gathered or rallied, or blessed the magic, all prepared for dodge, but they did not move, they are now the strongest combat experience, calm and calm, All of them saw that the light needed an accelerated process. There was still some time left before it was enough for them to dodge into the distance, so the followers were waiting for Richard’s orders, and they were used to waiting for Richard’s orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a stronger feeling of danger than anyone, so the response is faster than the followers, and when a follower is alert, he I have moved a few meters to the left and right, and then returned to the original place, but no matter how he evades, the shadow of death has always shrouded over his head, never changed, from the place where he stood, the distant light It was just a dazzling light spot, but the faint flicker of the light spot could not escape Richard's eyes. He found that the direction of the light column was very finely fine-tuned twice, always in the direction he was in, and before the dragon star The mysterious power that is placed on oneself begins to dry and exudes clear heat, echoing the distant beam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
