			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was extremely surprised to see that burning in the power of time The scroll, from the material, Richard clearly feels that this scroll is similar to the book that he has received, and can withstand the erosion of the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is a look at the scroll with a surprise, even interrupted the humming, quickly said to Clark: "What is this?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark endured the pain of transforming the body with the power of time, and said with a bite, "This is the Book of the Gods, which records the divine qualities of almost all true gods in the Faro plane. It is one of the artifacts left by the Sundial Church. The Faroese gods will regard the holders of the Book of the Gods as the greatest heresy. Be careful not to open it! It can only be used in a special way. And when the spell is opened, it can not be perceived by the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand drifted out of the air and took the book of the gods, without listening to Clark’s advice. The reel was directly expanded. Her amber eyes are constantly blooming with pale gold ripples. With the help of the time power of the book of Time, all the divine powers appearing on the scrolls are bound together, so that no one can overflow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After carefully reading the scroll from start to finish, Liu Sha asked: "It is with the help of it that you noticed from the batch of stained scrolls that I used it." The power of God does not belong to the gods of Faro, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Clark nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book of the gods in the hands of the sand is still absorbing the power of time, and although there is no singing of her, the light of the golden light is still from time. The flow of the book continues to overflow, it seems that it is the traction of this scroll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand-sanding eyes are getting brighter and brighter. Finally, she said to Clark in a solemn and solemn tone: "For the Eternal and Time Dragon, "The Book of the Gods" "It's a good sacrifice, dedication, you will receive God's gift. Now, Clark, are you willing to present "The Book of the Gods" to the Eternal and Time Dragon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For a true God's devotee, this is a question that does not need to be considered at all. However, Clark still struggled for a long time before he expressed his willingness to contribute. This shows the preciousness of the Book of the Gods and his feelings about this artifact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Clark’s burning power, he was able to maintain a level of priests of level 10 or above, relying on the role of the Book of the Gods. And the source of his strength to the unbelievers is also the Book of the Gods. They are not true unbelievers, but instead turn the object of faith from the gods to the Book of the Gods. Because the Book of the Gods contains the power of the gods of the Faro, it can also weakly accept the faith and give back the power of divine power. It is of course impossible to compare with the true God. It is far less powerful than a half-god. But the only way to convert faith into divine power is to have no title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Clark’s consent, the sand began to chanting the spell, the light on the book of Time suddenly became ten times stronger, and the intense pale golden light condensed into one If the actual light column, straight into the ceiling. But in the place that will be close to the ceiling, this light column disappears silently if it encounters an invisible barrier. Not only the ceiling, but the entire room of the sand is full of time, but there is no real overflow of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pillar of time, "The Book of the Gods" carries the book, and slowly falls to the book of time, eventually turned into a book page, and the whole book The book of time is integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
