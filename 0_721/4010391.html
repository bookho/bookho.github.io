			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was dragging the statue and came to the warehouse next door. Stacked with seven or eight large and small statues, Richard placed the mouse statue and slammed it on the wall behind the statue, leaving a long knife mark, and each statue had a knife mark behind it, or Long or short, but at the end of the part of the knife marks appeared jitter and distortion, the knife mark behind the mouse demon statue, its straight part is by far the longest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, Richard smashed the dust off his body, cut his beard and hair with a sculpted knife, and took the necessary equipment and simple Carrying the bag, handing over the newly-made structure to Lawrence, he left the capital of the day and set foot on the unknown journey again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days, Richard has stood more than a thousand kilometers away from the sun, and now in front of him, a huge crack in the earth, stretching Hundreds of kilometers, the rift valley is not at the bottom, only to see the dark red flames in the bottom of the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the wound of the earth, and it is also a natural barrier. After crossing this land, it officially left the protection of the sun-drenched capital and entered the so-called The dark wilderness, the dark wilderness are far away from the military fortresses of both sides, even the legendary strong can not be reached by ultra-long-distance transmission, this land is the real death playground, and it is also the place where the real strong can dare to act. The current situation in the dusk, the dark wilderness is more of the strongest of Dakosodas. In addition, there will be some unknown powerful monsters that have been flown into this plane by time. They are real. Danger is a powerful existence that will not be destroyed in the turbulence of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the crack of the ground for a while. The narrowest part of the wound was also about a dozen kilometers wide. He wanted to pass, except for the teleportation, he only flew past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not crazy enough to enter the dark wilderness, he runs along the cracked edge of the ground, carefully observes the surrounding terrain, and then chooses a low-lying land Lying in and covering yourself with gravel clay, this lay is a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no movement, no food, and there was a sudden surge of strength on the ground. A whole body was nearly 100 meters long. The monster of the snake's head whizzed through the cracks of the ground. Around this huge monster, there were dozens of Dax Sodas of various races floating up. This is the Dakosodas who never fall. The strangling force around the capital, just do not know the origin of the huge monster in the middle, but even if it is tens of kilometers apart, Richard can feel the huge pressure from the face, he immediately converges all the breath, Do not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge, cold and damp consciousness swept over the area where Richard was, but found nothing and swept past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is still waiting patiently, but every other day, he will eat something and drink a sip of water, and there are four or five Dakso Das From the vicinity of the ground crack, there are also left the day and the capital, back to the dark wilderness, there are also a few Noland strong into the dark wilderness, no matter which side, did not find the hidden Richard, Richard is now natural The world tree has grown to the third level, and its integration with the surrounding environment has been greatly enhanced. Even if it is a strong person, it is difficult to detect his traces by random detection and perception. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, an Angola horse captain took a powerful step and volleyed over the ground, and its route was just above Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the horse is more robust than the one that was killed in the night of the night, and the bristles of the whole body are as thick as a wire, and the body is covered with heavy Steel armor, when the four hooves move, the nails collide, and the sound of gold and iron strikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s hand holds the fate of Gemini, and a bloody lightning flashes in an instant, falling on the back of the captain’s captain, and the captain’s captain’s painful roar With both hands holding a short, chilly short-handed iron gun, glaring around, looking for a despicable enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a golden coffin appeared on top of it, pouring countless sacred powers on it, and the captain of the horse constantly screamed with anger. Struggling, those sacred and bright forces not only brought a lot of damage to it, but also severely hampered its actions, but it found a circle and did not find where the enemy was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another lightning flashed down and hit it. This lightning power is smaller than the previous one, but it hits accurately. The wound left by the previous lightning flashed the four-legged stalk of the captain, but it had already noticed that the source of the magic came from below, so he looked down and finally found the Richard, who was just standing up from the shallow pit. An earth-shattering roar, like a hill, pressed against Richard, four hooves with a bad wind, and trampled around, around the iron hoof, you can see a circle of ripples caused by tremendous power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right quite a bit of awkwardly fleeing to the distance, the captain of the horse is catching up at high speed, it has killed more than one big magister, knowing that as long as the distance is drawn Then, these great magisters of human beings are as fragile as a chicken, and they can tear it away at will. It quickly catches up with Richard, and the iron hoof slams into the heart of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s body was flashing, and the moment disappeared from the corps of the captain’s hoof. The captain of the horse was a cruel sneer. It was not just a big magician who had played with him in front of him. The human sorcerer’s only fake. Teleportation, it takes time to cast, and it takes time to move in the air. For it, it is not difficult to crack it. The two front hoofs of the team captains are not working, but instead force them to the ground, and the power of terror strikes. On the earth, a circle of mud waves is stirred up, and the moment is far away. The stirring power will destroy the magical power, and the teleporting magi will interrupt the transmission process, falling out of the space channel, being devastated and often vulnerable. The human great magister has only half a life left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh in the back of the captain’s side, and Richard threw it back and fell on it, even though he immediately climbed up. Still wolverine, and the chest feels dull and swollen, can't even say anything, if a big magister can't say anything, it is the ability to lose the chanting spell, and at least half of the ability is ruined. Know that the trampling of the Captain of Encore is the best choice for killing the mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the current Richard, there is no need to recite a spell on most of the battlefield. He clasps his brutal slaughter with his hands and cuts a light knife. A small wound was left on the back of the team captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the horse sneered, and for the huge body that is close to four meters, this small palm-sized wound is simply not worth mentioning, it is hovering, I have faced Richard positively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the small wound on the hind leg suddenly torn by himself, turned into a big pit with a flesh and blood of a human head, flesh and blood like a waterfall Squirting from the wound, the captain's hind legs were soft and almost fell. It looked at the hind legs in a suspicious way. I don't understand how it would suddenly hurt so badly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei whistling, screaming, and the long knife in his hand was on the horse’s chest, where the defense was extraordinarily heavy, even barbaric The power of killing the quasi-artifact level only broke the breastplate and left a shallow but long wound on the captain's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a negligible little injury. The idea of ​​the captain of the horse just came out, and suddenly saw that the small injury was tearing quickly and deepened in an instant. Ten times wider, the blood spurted out, just like weaving a red silk in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of Li is like a ghost, revolving around the team of captains, brutal slaughter like wind and fog, the fluttering East Thorn West, on the captain's body Adding a series of wounds, most of the small injuries will become huge wounds in a moment, blood and meat mixed together, just like adding a blood fountain to the captain of the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
