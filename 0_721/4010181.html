			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these ten days, Richard’s harvest is huge, the whole person’s temperament All have changed. Compared to the rapid improvement of combat and killing skills, the power of the will and the soul is the real gain. Richard doesn't know how to describe this kind of harvest, maybe it can't be called a harvest. After all, it can be said that it is a normal mentality to calmly watch the companions dismembering the opponent's body. However, it has been plagued by his inexplicable irritability, but disappeared unconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the twilight of the tenth day, the day and night are finally on the horizon. This is a magnificent giant city that stands on a mountainous peak and covers the entire mountaintop. The most striking building in the city is a towering spire, which is far from the sight. The spire is nearly a thousand meters high, and the spire at the spire shines. According to the height of the main tower, it should have been penetrated into the clouds, but now it is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just above the top of the day, I don’t know how thick the clouds are, there is a huge gap. The bloody skylight sprinkled from the crack, like a magnificent blood waterfall. The whole day is not covered with a layer of blood-colored luster, looking far away, very magnificent and strange, there is a land of sin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From seeing the capital of the day, to the real front of it, the entire past two hours. After ten days of study, running and exercise, Richard can now adjust the running state according to the surrounding environment, and maintain the flight speed that is not inferior to the parent nest while maintaining physical strength for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the two gates of up to 50 meters, Richard was once again lost. The gate is cut from the original rock of the plane, and the rough magical lines are consistently down. There are no traces of stitching and discontinuity. Such a high and so heavy city gate is no longer an ordinary sanctuary to manipulate. It is a legendary strongman. It is difficult to open and close without the help of the organs. The more so, the more it shows the strength and heritage of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four guards standing at the gate of the city. All of them are strong in the sanctuary. Which one is not lower than the white night. However, they saw the arrival of the white night, but they all showed a look of awe and intertwinedness. They even stood upright in an instant, and did not dare to have any mistakes in courtesy. Richard noticed that the eyes of the four guards all passed over the big packages on the white nights, and they showed an eager and envious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "White Night Adult, Marshal Long De Steader has been waiting for you for a long time, he hopes that you will see him the first time after returning to the day. "A tall guard said respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night said indifferently: "I know. But I still have something to do, let's talk tomorrow morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The name of Long De Steader always feels familiar. When I walked into the circular small square behind the city gate, Richard suddenly remembered the origin of the name and asked with surprise: "Long De Stead, is the legendary strongman who is known as the gun of the destruction of the Grand Duchy of Tumen?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night nodded and said: "It is him. If there is no legendary strongman sitting in the town, we can not keep the day and night."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee silently for a moment, then asked the question that had been thought for a few days: "Is the battle in the dusk land very unfavorable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night does not answer: "During the past few days, is it not clear enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . In the past ten days, the answer to this question has become clear. The night of the night and the landing of Richard’s transmission to the absolute battlefield are still within the coverage of the sun-drenched capital, but nearly 50 Dakso Das strongmen have been killed along the way, and Noland has been encountered. There are fewer than ten friendly troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fortress of this rank is not the capital of the day, there are eleven in the dusk, but only three of them belong to Noland." White night added a faint sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very simple numerical comparison, but very heavy pressure on Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the small square, there is a road that is 50 meters wide in front of the two people, all the way up, reaching the gate of the second floor. On both sides of the road are tall buildings made of rock, some of which have more than a dozen floors. However, the whole city is dead, and there are not many breaths of life except the strong Sanctuary who flies through the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no flight in the night, but a step by step step by step. Followed by the white night, Richard looked around as he walked. The field of view is not very good, because both the ladder and the fence are too tall, exceeding the general decoration or the need for security. Richard is already the height of an adult man. He is often blocked from sight. He sees all the rock surfaces, big and small. You have to deliberately or raise your head or turn your neck to see something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen that the city is not built by humans at all, and the architectural style is very different from the intellectual races known to humans and even Noland. The buildings here are magnificent and angular, and the rock used for construction is solid and dense. The sculptures on the sculptures are clearly distinguishable even after thousands of years of wind and rain erosion. The height of each floor of the building here is more than six meters, and the original residents of this type are at least three meters tall. If you are in Noland, this is the standard of the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of architectural style and sculpture decoration, leaving the rigorous atmosphere of these buildings, the iron and blood is hard and meticulous, in fact, it is possible to develop to a considerable A highly civilized race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, there is evidence of the glory of this civilization. However, nowadays, a large urban area that can live hundreds of thousands of people has become a ghost domain. The destruction that has been precipitated by long history and time makes people feel suffocated and desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard realized the intention of the white night. Only by using his own feet, can he perceive the deepest despair of the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a twinkling of an eye, the two went up to the second floor. This layer is only beginning to be lively, and you will always see walking or flying strong. There are also shops on both sides of the road, but many are closed, and only a few open the door. The buildings that are empty on both sides of the avenue account for the vast majority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owners of these shops are all similar to me. The reason for not opening the door may be that they are still hunting outside, or they may be dead. If a shop If you don't open the door for too long, then you can take it directly and take it. Of course, this is not necessary at all. There is nothing in the shop that does not open the door, and there are many empty houses on this street." White Night explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no ordinary people in the day and night, all of them are crazy like white nights or adventurers who want to make a fortune. In addition, if you feel that you have lived almost the same, or if you have no breakthrough, you will come to the battlefield. You want to experience a bloodthirsty madness, or see if there is any breakthrough between life and death. Therefore, the inhabitants of the day and night are so poor that they can count together some of them, and they are thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, you want to find a free person who looks at the store for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night suddenly turned a corner and went straight into a small shop on the roadside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
