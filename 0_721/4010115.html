			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the early morning to the late night, the fragile wall of Lanshui Oasis City is only resistant One morning, it was opened up several gaps. The Imperial Infantry suddenly swarmed in and rushed into the city. At the moment of breaking the city, even Saranwell felt that the war would soon end, and the next step was to consider chasing the enemy. So Saranwell began to think about how to send cavalry to contain Richard. It may not be easy to kill Richard, but it is a huge gain to be able to completely defeat his troops and kill the ones around him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the killing of the oasis in the city has been uninterrupted, and the war that has long since ended has not stopped. It wasn't until nightfall that Allenwell suddenly realized that the battle had just begun from the moment the city was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until night, the city of Oasis is still strangled. Salenville has been standing on the roof for a day, like a sculpture, dripping. His face was blue and he could only look at the oasis city where the fire was everywhere. The chaotic street fighting has gone beyond what he can control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a few fast horses broke through the night and ran to the front of Salenville. A battle in the middle immediately smashed a body, this person looks very familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a knight turned to kneel down, kneeling on one knee and shouting loudly: "His Royal Highness! General Barry General is unfortunately killed! We are so hard to get his body." Grab it back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barry?" Salenwell changed his face and jumped directly from the command car roof. The knights carefully carried the body of General Barry from the back of the horse and placed it in front of Salenville. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry is an elderly man, although nearly fifty, but his body is still as strong as steel. He is the confidant of Sharonville and one of the two heads of the army. The character of staunchness and exquisiteness allows him to command both the army and the front. The strength of the sanctuary is the strength of his rivalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city breaks, it is he who led a team to fight, went straight into the city, has been fighting until now, until now by his knights to the Saarland In front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry lie on his back, his eyes are still roaring, and the last cockroach still solidifies on his face. There were a few arrows in his body, and the roots were translucent until there was no feather. Salenville untied Barry's breastplate and saw a sharp knife wound in his heart. However, judging from the blood marks at the wound, Barry is already in a state of sudden death when stabbing the knife. Obviously, it is unnecessary for the enemy to make up the knife. However, Salenwell did not know that it was very important for the twilight to make up the knife. This knife is equivalent to a big supplement for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell’s eyes twitched and stood up, staring at the blue water oasis in the fire, his eyes twitching slightly. Suddenly, Allenville saw a group of Imperial infantry fleeing from the city, chasing a group of guys wielding weapons behind them. These are all kinds of guys, they are ragged, there is no formation at all, and some are just superior in number and fierce enough. Those people are not warriors at all, they are completely a collection of rogues, thieves and slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the exhaustion of the empire’s infantry, Salenville remembered that his soldiers had fought for a whole day. The cruel reality finally made him dismiss the idea of ​​a battle, and said to the knights around him: "Transfer, withdraw the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the magic fireworks in the night sky Blooming, while the screaming horn sounded through the earth, the Emperor team finally withdrew from the city. But when I saw the warriors who were all in the blood and exhausted, Saranwell could hardly believe that they were the soldiers they brought personally. But no matter how unbelievable, those are indeed the army of the empire, and they are the soldiers trained by him. Although the time is not very long, the combat effectiveness is definitely not low. However, the number of people who have withdrawn is much less than the number of people entering the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." A knight ran over and just wanted to say something, and he was interrupted impatiently by Shalwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Treat the wounded, count the damage, make a defense! Do these things have to be repeated again?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell is obviously in a bad mood. The knight is still biting his head and said: "Master Willis was seriously injured in the city. The great priest said that the master is actually poisoned. He can only think about it. The solution is relieved. If you want to save the master of Willis, you must immediately return the master to the temple of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Willius Master is also injured ?? Salenville was taken aback, then his face quickly gloomy. Willis is a 14th-level wizard and one of the six great wizards on the line. When he was siege, he ventured into Oasis City, but he did not expect to be seriously injured in the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconsidering Barry, who died in battle, suddenly felt uneasily uneasy in the heart of Saranwell, feeling that he seemed to have neglected something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killing sounds in Oasis City have subsided, and already daring people have taken to the streets and began to plunder the wealth of the Emperor’s body. More people are fighting for fire and trying to save their homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small square, Richard dragged his heavy body and walked over, struggling to open the door of a small hotel and walked in. There is a mess in the main hall of the hotel, and there are thick blood stains on the ground, apparently experiencing more than one battle. The tables and chairs in the hall had already been destroyed. Richard looked for a long time, and did not find a slightly clean place. He was no longer picky, but sat down against the wall and gasped. The extinction and destiny of the twins were thrown to the feet, contaminated with a lot of blood and mud, not the treatment of the legendary items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard is beating violently, and the body is empty, just like a dry riverbed, and almost no magic can be used. And the body began to suffer from soreness, which is the result of excessive physical overdraft. After a full day of fighting, the Imperial Forces finally retreated, and Allenwell’s determination seemed to be much greater than what Richard had expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few huge bats came in from the window, hung upside down on the ceiling and started to rest. These elite bats also exhausted their physical strength and needed rest. There is only one bat left in the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy footstep outside the hotel, and Gangde’s huge body squeezed into the hotel. He looked around and swept away with a huge axe, rudely cleaned out a clean place, then put a giant axe on the ground, sitting on the side of Richard, and began to gasp. Gangde has blood all over the body, and there are several eye-catching scars on the skin that is exposed to the outside. There are also several broken pieces on the armor with amazing defenses, revealing the wound below. From these wounds, you can see the intense battle of the day. If it is not this heavy armor, Gangde will probably not be seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting down, it obviously shocked the wounds of the whole body, so that Gangde had a mouthful of pain. He took out the jug, poured a few mouthfuls of spirits, and then looked at the empty jug, and he was very reluctant, but he handed it to Richard: "Hey! Come and drink two, this thing is refreshing!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the jug, first poured two big mouths, then spewed out a thick wine, and sure enough, the spirit improved a little. However, Richard did not return the jug to Gangde, but untied his own coat, revealing a wound of more than ten centimeters long from the shoulder to the chest, biting his teeth and pouring the spirits in the jug on the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard’s will is firm, he immediately took a breath of cold air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
