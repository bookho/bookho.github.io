			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adolescent, Richard did not dare to look directly at Su Helun, that is not only It is the pressure from the super strong, but also because the legendary mage Zhang Yang is almost arrogant, so Richard's gaze flicks her figure every time, the heart will jump, and at that time, in front of the legendary mage, There is no room for rebellion at all. No matter what happens, only accepting it. Of course, if Richard complains about going out, it is estimated that the whole Nolander man will be quite willing to "accept" this kind of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now it’s not the same, let’s not say that Nyris is a man, and Richard is by no means not able to fight back. If you are in a hurry, you can only At the distance of the personal fight, Richard determined that he could put the four emperors down in half a minute. However, looking at the delicate and innocent face, Richard always felt that if he punched his fist, his heart would twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heartache is better than being really kissed. Richard is so comforting himself, then silently picks up the heat, starts the magical armed, ready to resist anytime The “repression” of the arrival, while carefully controlling the spillover of energy changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is a true talent, from wisdom to body to blood, everything is not the best choice, but the actual combat experience is not enough, but his combat power is absolutely Can not be underestimated, a negligence, Richard may be really "repressed" by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said helplessly: "Hey, Nyris, you...will not be serious."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not." Nyris is very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more serious the four emperors are, the more scared Richard is, the more he said with a smile: "But you were not like this before, you used to be, oh, very beautiful, But now it is...that...beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very euphemistic and believes that Nyris can understand, however, Nyris understands However, the lips smacked a smile that made Richard stunned and said slowly: "I recently agreed with a famous quote from Wilde..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard The name of Wilde, Richard immediately knew it was bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oscar Wilde, this is a name that has left a strong mark in the whole human history of Noland. There are countless auras on his head, combining the power of the Marquis, the great poet, the big playwright, the big singer and the great philosopher. Knowing that the gods will slap his looks, in terms of talent, Wilde is not only at the forefront of the achievements in several fields, but also at the forefront of the entire era, or the first genius in history to develop the career of the bard to the legendary level. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time on the Egyptian peninsula of the southern empire of the Millennium Empire, the 30,000-emperor ** confronted the 100,000-strong army of the Naga Empire across the sea, when Wilde was the royal account The former one, from the time when the two armies launched the first hedge, improvised the "Exodus", and then sang a song, the gain effect actually covered the entire battlefield, the morale of the millennium imperialism, the defeat of victory, one will The coalition of the Kazakh, the snake, the lizard and the half-dragon rushed to the sea, and Wilde became famous in the first battle. The bard was regarded as the chief occupation of surpassing the commander on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While another one to be remembered is a famous saying after the Battle of the Egyptian Peninsula, when Wilde, who reached the peak of his life, faced a famous mainland. When a beautiful woman asks for love, she once said: "My life is today, only men can make me interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This famous saying is even better than the famous song The Egyptians are spread more widely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat of Richard has come down, the ability to control the law seems to be weakened, and the hot breath begins to emanate from his body, which is going to break out. Aura of the. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris suddenly stood up straight, reached for a pick on Richard's chin, and chuckled: "Let you let me go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Richard laugh and laugh, and mixed, the word "temporary" made him wonder if he was let go, or just want to swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still hadn’t finished his confusion, and Nyris sat down on his seat and said, “Time is tight, we should be serious. Think about business, not to make trouble here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee is speechless, it always seems that Nyris is half-truth there. The fake fights are now, but now he has learned to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the defenders who surrendered to Maple Fire City were concentrated in the square and held a simple oath ceremony. The vowed content was to give up the silver sword family. The loyalty and turn to be loyal to Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ritual is not forced, but Richard will be willing to swear and register those who refuse to swear, and the swearing loyalty to Archimonde will be released on the spot, and the officers will be appointed from them, just like the previous times. When Richard left a certain place, he directly handed over the defense of that place to him, and refused to pledge to remain in the prisoner of war camp. The conditions there were not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The binding force of the oath is large and small. In a world without faith, the vow is like the air, the world of God, the vow is much more important, but The binding force is also large and powerful. The more powerful the person is, the more important it is to the vows, the greater the binding force, the oath in the name of God, and even the oath of his real name. Once it is violated, the consequences are extremely serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ordinary warriors, the binding force of the oath is much smaller, the direct cost of betrayal is very light, or even no, Richard does not expect to swear It will bring a group of loyal warriors, but just a simple screening through the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the city that was abandoned by Richard, no silver sword lord dared to fight back, Richard’s lightning tactics, and the repression on the battlefield The advantage has already made them completely chilly, that is, to take the city back and can not hold it, why attract the attention of Richard, Richard this time to start the extreme, only half of the silver sword lords on the battlefield become prisoners, the rest All of them died in battle, and there was only one man who escaped, or the result of the intentional release of water. Therefore, the small lords are waiting for the war to be completely over. Anyway, the land and the city can be taken back at the negotiating table. Why bother? Go to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the previous cities, Richard selected the defender of the small town Maple Fire, and went to Jianfeng City, and went to Jianfeng City that night. The silver sword family scattered around the city, the detective ride suddenly crashed, and luckfully ran back to the city, far away can only escape to the countryside, but Richard did not care about their meaning, even a knight Did not send out to pursue, and even looked at the gates of the city from the far and wide, did not try to take the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of the knights began to camp, and Richard took some people around the Jianfeng City to take a full circle, taking the city defense situation to the bottom, occasionally Richard will also let the spearman throw out two explosive spears, try to see the solidity of the wall, or let the three or five knights join forces to kill a small eye in the city with a spear. Aristocrats or officers have to admit that the city defense built by the Silver Sword family has something to offer, perhaps because it is at the border and will be attacked at any time, so the strength of the city defense has reached the level of fighting against large-scale siege alchemy equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This circle went down, the defenders on the wall were in danger, and a large number of prepared soldiers were called up, all draped, waiting for the city to fight, in the process of inspecting the city defense, although Richard’s knight only killed the wall. Several ordinary warriors and two aristocratic officers, but everyone is extremely nervous, do not know if the next unlucky guy will turn himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times in the middle of the road, Richard even flew a few hundred meters of high altitude, overlooking the entire Jianfeng City, so arrogant, the silver sword family is not without people Dare to fly to challenge Richard, there are no people who shoot a shot at the city, and have the ability to shoot into Richard, for fear of being targeted by the underlying knights, a round of fire, not a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large lap of the big lap, Richard returned to the barracks and said to Nyris: "The old fellow of Finril can’t keep it, he thinks he has to In fact, it is to polish the morale of his army. You see, I have all flown into the sky. I don’t even have a guy who dares to go out of town to fight. But this is exactly what I want, you look at how I put the sword. Let's hit the windy city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris gave Richard a blank eye and said: "The silver sword family has no legendary strongman, a few ordinary holy What is the domain going out of town, and sending it to death? Which sanctuary is willing to send his head to the mouth of the ogre lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nyres argued about this problem, but instead set the tactics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole night, Jianfeng City did not stop the turmoil. Under the cover of the night, Richard’s knights were gone, seemingly distributed in all directions, and the attack will always come from various The direction comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After midnight, the tentative attack began, and even the costume knight rushed directly to the city wall. After a while, he was willing to retreat. The spirit of the defending army was extremely tense. Always be vigilant, in case a certain test attack becomes a real battle, but the ordinary warrior is killed in front of Richard's all-excellent knight. Later, Finrill had to put the knight And the strong people of the sanctuary were sent out, but they were strictly prohibited from leaving the protection of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After repeatedly analyzing the multi-information to determine the location of a certain sanctuary strongman, Richard quietly concentrated all the knights and suddenly set them up. The fire, repeated intensive intensive blows directly smashed the unlucky one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finril’s response was to rush all the sanctuary and the knights to the city, and they must receive a command to allow them to board the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
