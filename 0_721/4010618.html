			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris still remembers Richard’s embarrassment, not chasing it in, Just standing on the head of the city, looking around, murderous, the remaining sanctuary and the knight can only look up at him, but no one dared to fight in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, Nyris’s position was extremely difficult. He used various terrains and even briefly floated, not only avoiding the strong swordsmanship. Several aids and interceptions have also kept his figure above the height of the city wall, and with the painful lessons of the silver sword sanctuary in front of him, the silver sword strongman discovered his temptation to lure the enemy. I have to pay attention to my position, for fear of becoming the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A night of chaos, the silver sword finally hoped for the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the morning, Richard listed the attack formations under the city, and tried to launch attacks in various locations. Each attack was stopped and then changed. Next place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of Swordwind City is a hindrance to the average knight, but it is not a problem for the Archimonde Knights who are all equipped with the magic ride. If you ride a sprint, you can climb the 30-meter-high wall straight, and with the help of the Cavaliers, the forty-meter wall of Jianfeng City is also in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a challenge to maximize the control of the damage. The size of Jianfeng City is not large, but it is built entirely in the way of the battle, the outer wall There is also a Tibetan soldier between the inner wall and the street fighting. The street fighting is not a pleasant thing for the cavalry, and Richard only needs to think about the bet of the four emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, it’s at noon, this is the time that Richard and Robert and the Earl of Hiltus agreed, but the two counts’ army Did not see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic clock points to twelve o'clock, Richard shrugged and said to Neris next to him: "The old fox is the old fox, always looking for the best time. Note, but sometimes there is only one chance to place a bet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Richard’s harassing attacks continued, from early morning until late at night, Jianfeng City The defenders have long been exhausted, and even the knights and the sanctuary have some feelings of enthusiasm. Although they do not consume much physical strength, the mental pressure is enormous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, the battle in the city of Nyris was amazing. The silver sword family’s sanctuary was beaten with no fighting power, vomiting blood and fleeing, and directly lost the fighting power, so now the silver sword sanctuary needs to be wary that it is two A powerful sanctuary, the ogre lord and Nyris, the pressure has doubled directly, perhaps three, because Richard has not yet moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the sky is overcast. When the night falls, no one notices the clouds in the sky. I don’t know when there are a few special drops. The low clouds are growing, and they are getting bigger and bigger. Near midnight, there are more than a dozen clouds in the air. Each cloud cover is hundreds of meters thick. The dark clouds are getting thicker and thicker, and the jumping light is faintly visible in the depths of the clouds. It seems that it is possible to drop a bolt of lightning at any time, but they only flash between the clouds and never fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fire in the city below, and the screams are endless. People have no intention of seeing what happened on the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night of intermittent battles, the ordinary warriors of the silver sword are extremely exhausted, even those veterans who are above level 5 are a little sluggish, their vindictiveness It has already consumed more than half of it. What is even more terrible is that there has been deep fatigue in the spirit. There are battles that may lose life all the time. In a few games, the veterans can’t afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the city, Richard’s knight gathered again and began to approach, and the defenders on the head of the city looked numbly. This is not the first time, Li The knights inspected have an overwhelming superiority, and they can always rush to the city, harvesting their lives like mowing, and then returning to them, and then returning to them, those who are usually in the same age, the knights, and the holy The domain lords, what are they doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the knights and the sanctuary are huddled in the city, and a few who dare to rush to the wall to fight, have been beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally it’s time, Richard raises his right hand and pushes forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of spearmen took out the last three bursting spears and slammed them into the city. A group of flames continued to blow up on the walls, and several figures were visible from time to time. The flames flew up and the explosion sounded like thunder, but the soldiers were not afraid. No matter how dense the explosion, they stood still. They knew that they were killed when they were bombed, but they died later. After the three shots of the three spears, all the silver sword guards within a few hundred meters of the city gate were empty for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard’s hand pointed to the city gate again. Thirty of the kiosks who had recharged their batteries and rushed forward, and marched in the battle of the captain’s battle, and they threw their spears. The roots are black and the spears are all forged by Lafite iron, which is a special expensive nail-breaking spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spear flies over a distance of 100 meters, nailed to the gate of the steel cast, the roots are so deep that there is no handle, each spear is inserted, It will bring the city door to bang, and the tremors will end. The aftermath of the whole city tower is shaking, the gray stone is falling, and the additional vindictiveness begins to lag behind, superimposing another deadly wave. After the thirty spears, nearly one meter thick, the gate that can resist the full impact of the large siege alchemy machinery has been tilted inward and crumbling, but it has not completely collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth suddenly began to vibrate, Tiramisu rushed out, the dark red vindictiveness rose, like a burning blood cloud, the city head shot The long arrows, the shooting guns and even the mattresses were all thrown to the side by Tiramisu’s fighting spirit. The ogre lord rushed to the front of the city gate and held up ten tons of warhammers. Both heads were deeply inhaled at the same time. Suddenly there was a horrible dragon faucet emerging in the air, the dragon's eyes slowly opened, and then a silent roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang,. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar of the sounds of the heavens and the earth, two incomparably heavy gates fell to the city and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for a few knowledgeable people, the huge fascinating shadow behind Tiramisu is really shocking, it’s not ordinary The dragon, it is not what has no meaning, just use the scary shadow, it is the dragon of chaos, is one of the main gods worshipping chaos and violent races such as ogre, orc, dwarf, dragon, etc. The huge faucet of ten meters is actually less than one tenth of the true size of the dragon body of Chaos. How big is the dragon of Chaos? In fact, no one can say clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu spurred the virtual shadow of the Chaos Dragon with a full blow, indicating that the Ogre Lord has received the attention of the Chaos Dragon, and this often It means that the door to the legend has been touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the observation deck of Sword Castle, the Count of Fenlier was iron-blue, and behind him a group of silver swords led the owner to be horrified. The biggest rely on the silver sword was the sword wind. The city's urban defense intensity, the siege party without large siege equipment can only fight the war of attrition. In any case, it can support the arrival of the reinforcements. However, the city gate is directly opened by human beings in this unheard-of-a-kind manner. Immediately turned into nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s tactics are always unexpected. He used the spears of the knight to bombard the city gate. You know that within a day, the first-order knight can only throw the spear three times, even if it is the average level of Richard’s knight. Higher, no more than four times, he actually used the construction of the knight to attack the city gate, no, he also used an ogre lord, issued a powerful blow, the heavenly sanctuary level The Ogre Lord can use the power of the Sanctuary at most once a day, which is a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the luxury of Richard, the Sword City defense has been broken, and the blink of an eye is a melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The order, the knight is dispatched, and the gate is blocked." Finrill ordered, and the horn around him immediately blew the trombone, interwoven with long and short lengths. The number sounded through the city, and the knights assembled in a small square began to gather their anger and turned to the avenue that passed through the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count suddenly said: "Wait a minute, let the knights stop, the top of the third heavy infantry battalion, five or six guard camps."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This order is out, everyone is stunned, the battlefield situation is extremely dangerous, it is common sense to use the construction knight on the most critical battlefield, and the knight They have already moved, and suddenly they have to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to this execution." The count snorted again, and the commander immediately blew the battle number. The knights who had already stepped up heard the warfare. It’s chaotic to stop the war horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Sword Guards are still staying under the castle. They are all made up of children of the Silver Sword family. Their loyalty is unquestionable, and they are all quasi-constructed knights. The count's emphasis on this unit is not inferior to the construction of the knight, which has never been used in this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people with good eyesight who have seen a row of black and gray knights coming in from the collapsed gates, so the appearance and the strict team The shape is already well known. These knights are the knights who claim to be the killers of the structure. As long as they see the opponent's knights, they will be as crazy as they are ignoring everything and attacking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver sword lords now understand the meaning of the Count of Fenlier, let the ordinary warriors go first, use as cannon fodder to consume the power of the knight, or The Knights are fighting against the Knights of the Front, and they must be destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
