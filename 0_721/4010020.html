If it is not of this quality, it can't block the star's gaze. Gordon frowned and said, "How come you get such a terrible thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you pass by a half-plane, you just saw it and you slaughtered it. Fortunately, I didn't feel more difficult than the devil's little lord." The legendary mage said nothing, and finally had a leisure time to sort out the messy hair, and then went on to say, "When you come back alive, throw it to the old man." Dragon! This will eradicate the hidden danger. Nothing else, I have to go. I am very busy recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Gordon stopped Su Hailun, frowning said: "There are countless planes in the turbulent flow of time. Without the dragon of eternal and time, it is impossible to find the plane where Richard went. You have no result! It is very dangerous. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage snorted and said, "Who said that I was looking for him? I just walked freely between the planes! By the way Xiaocai. Little Gordon, you still worry about yourself, I advise you to best dispel the idea of ​​Mensa’s exclusive plane, first concentrate on Xiong Peter. The family's plane developed and said. To be honest, astrology tells me that your recent luck is very bad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Gordon’s turn. One voice, said: "Don't knock down this plane of the Mensa family, they will continue to mess with me. The old guy has a rich family, and the sacrifices that can be used for sacrifice are still unknown. In addition, only play them. It hurts, they will tell the details of the sacrifice on the day, it is possible to trace the coordinates of the place where Richard went!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a very difficult road! And it's not very likely to find Richard. After you see that Schumpeter sends a hunting squad, you don't have any follow-up actions, you can know that they also have no coordinates." Legendary Master is unceremoniously The comment and concluded, "So the wise thing is to give up. Richard is a little guy but my student, this little problem can't beat him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gordon laughed, just asking: "I still mean to say, you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legend In the eyes of the teacher, there was a dangerous blue fire, and said faintly: "When I was young, I had an agreement with the emperor of the Holy League. I could not start with the giant family listed on the fauna. Otherwise, I have already put Mensa. The territory of the old thing burned! Hey, if he can bear it, how can I provoke no response, and I will not give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon Touching the short hair of a steel needle, revealing a charming and dangerous smile, said: "I am going to do it now, isn't that the same thing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun took a deep look at Gotton and said, "If you want to die, just like you." In addition, I have already sent black gold a batch of things, you save them, they are small things that can be thrown to the old dragon. If Xiao Licha suddenly came back, give him this, and it is my sister's joy. But this is for Richard, not for Archimonde! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I am there, no one dares to move his things." "Gordon said.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage nodded and turned to the portal, the jumping pony tail swayed outside the light curtain and disappeared into the light gate. Among them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun went in a hurry, but left a big trouble for Gordon. Looking at the wrapped star beast head, Gordon didn't know what to do. He thought for a long time, but there was no means to save it safely and secretly. In the end, he had to make a death order to keep the layer of the castle. As long as you don't appear, you can't let anyone enter the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for thieves... No thief can steal things on the floating island of FS. Those thieves who enter the sanctuary, if they want to steal the head of the star beast, will most likely turn into a stardust that is hard to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, the transfer door to the Mensa family's exclusive plane was completed. In order to get this huge and stable space channel, Gordon not only paid the savings of the past years, but also doubled his debt to Su Helen. The other end of the space channel is one of the nine exclusive seats of the Mensa family. The exclusive plane is the core interest of each family. Once it is captured by others, it is also the most painful place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the plane portal was completed, Gordon had waited in front of the portal, behind him, the eight-position knights lined up. Then there was a line of 30 second- and 60-degree first-order knights, followed by 40,000 elite troops in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dazzling light blooms from the portal, Gordon instigates the 'dark moon black inflammation', carrying the epee that has harvested countless lives, taking the lead Plunge into the portal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, the murderous army sneaked in and embarked on the journey of unknown destiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menza is not Joseph, not Schumpeter, but a giant that has accumulated thousands of years and profound knowledge. In this war, even Gotton can't predict success or failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just after the last unit entered, the light of the portal began to dim. Although it is a stable passage, it is still costly to enter such a large army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only the last faint energy left in the portal, maintaining the connection with the ectopic plane. When the result of the campaign has a result, someone will send a special contact signal from the end, and the special person left behind will add the magic crystal to the portal, so that the army of the ectopic plane can return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge cost of transmission is the biggest expenditure in the plane battle. If there is not enough rich harvest in the ectopic plane, then the war may be at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the portal, more than a dozen mages are busy, steady portals, reduced consumption, set defense magic arrays, etc., and a lot of aftercare work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, the solid space suddenly had a strange wave of fluctuations, and the brilliance of the portal that had been basically extinguished was soaring and violently shaken! The mages were shocked first. They didn’t react to what happened. They were so absorbed by the huge force that they didn’t know where they came from. The magic of the whole body was sucked away by the magic array like water, and the portal vibration became more and more powerful. The light is getting more and more blazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, in the eyes of the wizards, the portal was smashed! The violent explosion not only destroyed the buildings around the square, but also made the black rose castle full of cracks on the entire wall of the square! Watching the army in the square, the Akmende people who have not recovered from the spectacular scene suddenly died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, compared with the lives of these sub-branches, there is one more important thing, that is, the army of Gordon, the retreat is extinct! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
