			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are huge rift valleys that are bottomless everywhere, some can Seeing the dark red magma flowing at the bottom, some rifts could not see the bottom at all, only the thick fog lingered in the rift. These huge canyons are like the wounds of the earth, and the roads are criss-crossed to the extent that they have completely killed the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushing Richard suddenly stopped and quickly fell into a shallow ditch on the ground. Not far away, a Tomiler demon came out from Rock Hill. This is a female with golden red hair and a beautiful face that is also beautiful by human standards. Her eyes passed through the flames of light, continually patrolling around, the huge chain in her hand dragging on the ground, beating along every undulating, giving a heart-rending bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard, he immediately recalled all the information about the Tomirer, including their body structure and where they were deadly. The height of the Tomiler Devils is about two meters. They are small in the Dakosodas, but they have great power that is not commensurate with the body shape. They like to use heavy weapons, but the agility and speed are rather general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a young Tomille woman, the material of the chain is generally light, and the weight is obviously much lighter than the weapon of the strong Tomler warrior. From the heaviness of the weapon, you can distinguish the strength of the Tomirer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He converges on the whole breath, and does not move on the ground. But he knows that every Dakso Das is a good hunter. This female Tomille demon is obviously concentrating on searching the surroundings, and he probably can't hide for long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sound of the chain dragging on the ground suddenly stopped! Richard did not think about it, and immediately flew up, the book in his hand was opened, and a bursting fireball shot at the Tomirer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Tomille woman opened her mouth and revealed a horrible smile. Her mouth usually looks like a human woman's mouth, but once it is fully open, the corner of the mouth can be cracked to the back of the ear, revealing a bloody mouth with hundreds of fine sharp teeth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at Richard, accidentally weak and young in Richard, but the fresh taste of the young people made her excited, drowning from the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the bursting fireball that Richard shot, she simply dismissed it, and slightly let the fireball hit the route directly, and strode to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chain is still dragging on the ground, and the other empty wrist is rotating strangely, but she is afraid of a chain to smash it into a meat sauce. At that time, it was too much trouble to lie on the ground and eat flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the fireball passed by, the Tomel's demon suddenly felt a strange smell from the fireball, it was a wild ruin ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tomel's demon had no time to respond, and he screamed and was drowned by the fire. The flame is not particularly hot, but it burns the pain she can't tell! Under the real name of destruction, the property of the bursting fireball has already been transformed, bringing a breath of abyss of prison fire, and the lethality is greatly enhanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick flame is affixed to the devil, burning in the air, as if the fierce beast swallowed flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li is rapidly flipping the book of bearing, and successively fired two bursting fireballs. The screams of the female devils were so terrifying that they clashed in the fire, and even the chains were thrown on the ground. However, Richard knows that her vitality is extremely tenacious. Even if the whole body is burned to the ground, it is equivalent to serious injury, and she can still fight. Just looking at her while screaming, but slantingly still rushing toward Richard, I knew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire wave is over, the female devil is still burning with a prison fire, and her body is constantly squirting a burst of red and black mist, each squirting a mist Will extinguish a prison fire. However, at this time, her eyes suddenly flashed, and a feeling of danger that was stronger than before was on my mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brutal slaughter has already been squirted, and Richard has both hands holding a knife and flat front. Such a simple action pulls out an afterimage! Then, the figure of Richard flashed, disappeared in place, and suddenly appeared in front of the Tomiele female demons! And the barbaric slaughter has become a phantom, so fast that you can't see it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a gust of wind that gently passed over the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The action of the Tomir's demon man suddenly stopped, and suddenly looked at Richard, who had retreated to ten meters away, and made a squeaking voice in his mouth, not knowing Mutter something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a large wound on her neck, and a small bloody mark was continuously combined into a larger wound, which turned into a fuzzy flesh and blood in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the demon man suddenly flew out of the body, throwing it away, and the look of sorrow solidified on his face. Her breastplate was also covered with cracks. Numerous cracks spread like spider webs in all directions. Finally, a horrible hollow appeared in the chest and the arms fell off the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's headless body lasted for a long time before it fell slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently spit out the gas and suddenly sweated. Just now he started the magical armed forces and drove his life to death. Although the combat time was short, he had consumed more than half of his physical strength. This is the nature of life. If you shoot, you will see life and death. If you can't kill each other, then you will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While adjusting his breathing, Richard quickly walked over to the body of the demon and began harvesting materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the female devil is young, the strength is not very strong, but the core quality of the energy is very good. This organ, which can be used as a sacrifice, determines the talent of the devil. It seems that it is placed in Dakosodas. This young female demon may also be a genius. Now it has fallen into the battlefield on the ground and turned into a sacrifice and black crystal in the package of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took care of everything in a few minutes and then quickly left. He is in a bad state now. If you come back to an enemy, you don't have to be strong. As long as you are equal to the female devil, he will mostly flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few hours later, Richard found a hidden cave, arranged the camouflage, rested inside, and slowly restored the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His heart beats very quickly, and it takes a long time to calm down. The sinister danger of the absolute battlefield is unusual. He just encountered the enemy after he entered. This road to the sun-drenched capital is more difficult than it is to imagine. However, Richard touched the fate slab in his pocket, and the hard touch gave him a sense of security, his heart gradually settled and he was able to rest. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four hours later, Richard walked out of the cave and continued to travel on the earth by the shining light of the sky and the light of the time stream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard’s luck was not so good. He accidentally fell into the ambush of his opponent. Looking at the two young Encore people who ran to the left and right, Richard looked very ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Angkor people are ordinary, not as fierce as the captain of the night and night killing. But they also have the power of Nolan's primary sanctuary, and they are two. Moreover, the speed of the people and horses is extremely fast. It is a natural hunter. With Richard's current speed, he can't escape. He can only fight to the end! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to take a deep breath, put three long knives one by one on the ground, holding only the fate of the twins, and then began to ignite the crazy battle in the depths of the eyes. meaning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha first started the sacrifice, starting with an eight-level enhanced chain lightning! After destroying the double bonus of the real name and the fate of the twins, the bloody electric light is as thick as a bucket! The electro-optic light fell silently on the left man's warrior, and he wore a horrible hollow in his horse's body. The man has a powerful magical resistance, and he is dismissive of the magic of the 16th-level human mage in front of him. The result is that the magic of Richard's collection of countless destructive powers is hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right-handed warrior warriors made an earth-shattering trench and rushed to Richard. Richard started the life and refused to meet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so sullen that he had been swept by the heavy hammer of the Warrior, and his left arm could no longer be lifted. Just as the Terracotta Warriors shouted and raised their forefoot, ready to give Richard a fatal blow, Li mouthed a piece and blew a colorless and transparent fire! This is his last card, purely driven by the destruction of his real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Warrior sneer, the warrior out of Dax Sodas, no matter which race is not too afraid of fire. However, with the lessons of the previous car, he raised his hand and waved a strong hurricane, trying to scatter the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fire is still condensed, and if it is tangibly stuck to the edge of the hurricane, it will fall down and reach the arm in the blink of an eye, so the arm will silently fall. ! As soon as the Warrior was staying, the pain had not yet reached the central nervous system, and the fire had penetrated his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior bowed his head and looked at the wound that was suddenly expanding silently on his chest. He couldn’t figure out how weak the flame would be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the final question, the Terracotta Warriors crashed down. Richard was standing up, his face was full of strange flushes, and his body was as uncomfortable as a fire, and even a breath of burnt smell was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was unable to dismember the body of the Warrior, barely dug out their heart, and quickly left the battlefield to find a hiding place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very heavy at the moment because his left arm has been broken. There is still at least a week away from the capital of the day, and in his current state, there is no way to get there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finding the hiding place, Richard could no longer restrain himself from fatigue and fell asleep. This sleep turned out to be three days and three nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up again, Richard’s first feeling was hungry, extremely hungry, and he felt that he could eat anything now, even in the underground passage. The moss can turn into a delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
