Of course, I am sure to make some modifications to these big guys, good Let my flight shorten and smooth. When the magic warships are modified, I will leave. There are still about three months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex It seems to be relieved, saying: "There is time. I will apply to the emperor and send a few messengers to you. After all, we still have a little high elf blood, and the elves of the green continent are still willing to communicate with us. Maybe you can get what you want very smoothly. If you can't fight, try not to play as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Good idea! Well, let me know when you are selected, and then go to the dark blue collection before the departure date."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good Micks promised to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cutting off the magic newsletter, Richard thought about it. Whether you go to the abyss or go to the green continent, you will not be very smooth. Even if the road map is finally obtained from the high elves, it needs to be layerd and may be intervened by the abyss. When necessary, I am afraid I need to kill one or two big lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing the big lord in the abyss? It sounds like a nightmare, but Richard knows that this may be the strength that must be possessed to go to the Abyss. The dozens of abyss that cannot pass by are the big lords of good temper, and it is still indifferent to see strangers appear in their own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate priority is to become familiar with the abyss rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then cleaned up the simple line and went to the abyss' points battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Richard has really made the strong people here excited and faintly worried. In fact, the problem here is the same as the dragon's plane, that is, the number of strong people is too much, and the devil is already not enough to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the abyss is different from the dragon's plane, the strong can't go deep into the plane to hunt. The environment there has a great impact on humans. Most of the Sanctuary strong people can't stay for a long time. The extremely harsh environment will seriously affect their combat effectiveness. The devil is like a duck in such an environment. Under this circumstance, the gap will become extremely huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, most of the strong people can only stay outside the transmission channel, waiting for the demons to rush out to die. Only a few legendary powerhouses have ever entered this abyssal expedition, but they quickly retired. If you go deep into the abyss, even if it is extremely dangerous for the legendary strong, if you encounter a small demon lord, you may escape. The pair of flesh behind the devil is not just a display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these restrictions are obviously useless to Richard’s superpower. Richard went straight through the plane channel and once again came to the abyss. Then he chose a direction at random, and went all the way. In the twinkling of an eye, he went far away from the eyes of the powerful people until they disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s going is ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten days, Richard appeared from the horizon of the abyss, contrary to the amazing momentum that was invincible when he left, he quietly came from afar, blink of an eye Going back to the portal and returning to Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole process, Richard did not alarm even a demon, as if he did not exist at all. There were several strong men around the plane that saw this scene, all of them shocked, but they all knew how sensitive the devil felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the abyss, Richard immediately went to Faro and began to draw the costumes. He got too much material from the Goshawk and Su Hailun treasures, so there are many different designs waiting for him to finish designing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the deepest part of the world, Richard also hopes to make these different structures as much as possible. This aspect is to enrich the point redemption system, but on the other hand, it also wants to leave more structures for future generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he has occupied the most dazzling position in the history of Norland’s history, it is necessary to come up with enough matching achievements, but also to consolidate His own historical status. At this point, Richard also failed to be excused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a number of sets, Richard will go to the abyss again. If so, his next life is to swing back and forth between the workbench and the abyss, abnormally simple and boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the boring life of Richard began soon, and the ice floes became bustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of giant magic warships emerged from the outer sea of ​​the ice floes and slowly sailed towards the deep blue. Far apart, the dark blue responsible for the wizard found the team of magic warships. These magical hulls are huge, and they are bigger than any warships that the experienced wizard has seen in the past. It is like a moving sea city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era of volume-determining power, such a giant ship must be powerful, completely the king of the naval battle. And there are a total of seven giant ships in this fleet, so strong enough to cross the sea. On a ship of this size, you can easily install hundreds of magical weapons and load thousands of elite warriors. It is no exaggeration to say that this fleet is enough to destroy a duchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master of the Desperate Forces the shock of the heart, constantly adjusting the focal length of the magic, and observing all the details of this sudden fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical vision constantly moves, and finally settles on a flying flag. It was a dark gray base with a white bear head banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master lost his voice and exclaimed. Anyone in the dark blue is no stranger to this banner. It is the flag of the Polar Continental Parliament. The war between them and the dark blue lasted for decades! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older mage rushed to the door and slammed the switch of the siren. The magic bell of the police then sounded over the dark blue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was still a calm dark blue, this moment immediately boiled, countless people running back and forth. The mages were well-trained, and they immediately stopped the experiment according to the procedure, sealed the dangerous materials, and then closed the protective doors and then evacuated to the designated area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which is the unscrupulous chop to dare to find trouble in the dark blue? Laozi’s experiment is only halfway through!” In the chaotic crowd, the black gold voice is particularly bright. . The gray dwarf had all the oil on his face and his beard was a lot less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf rushed to the passage leading to the upper level, followed by a whole team of fully armed night elf warriors. Everyone automatically gave way to Black Gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gold is now one of the most important figures in the dark blue. Those foreign wizards are still much stronger than the black gold, but the relationship between Black Gold and Richard. That was from the time of Richard’s youth. Whoever offends the black gold, even the legendary mage may have to bow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archimonde's Highness was recently sharpened, not only with the force of the Holy Alliance, but all the giants did not dare to fight, but also defeated the undecided Queen, and even the Reaper lost to his men! The most recent news is that it is speculated that Richard will break through the bottleneck of the superpower in the future and reach a new level. Under such power, humility seems to be taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a mage rushed over and anxiously shouted: "Black gold master! A large fleet suddenly appeared on the sea outside the ice floe! The flag is from the magical fleet of the polar continent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gold face suddenly became a bit weird, oh, said: "Is it that I will never grow up." Are the close relatives coming? After so many years, haven’t they learned to be smart?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mage does not know how to answer, only the only . In the polar continent, the Grey Dwarf is one of the most important races. There must be a large number of gray dwarves on the coming fleet. Black Gold himself is a gray dwarf, who knows what attitude he is now with his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gold suddenly flicked a layer of murderous, sneered and said: "If they think that dark blue is the dark blue of Su Hailun's Highness, then it is completely wrong. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold turned back to the night elf behind him and said, "Go and take my things up to the tower! I have to give them only in the snow." The rolling idiot has a deep lesson!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the order of Black Gold was rejected: "We can't lift it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a full ten night elves! They all have 16 levels of combat power. Others don't say that it is not a problem for ten people to work together to lift dozens of tons of things. But they all said that they couldn’t move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's more to find someone!" Black Gold roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elf warriors hurried away, and Black Gold ran all the way to the top of the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the top platform, the big wizards have arrived, and the knights are assembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm bell still sounds in one voice. The magical fleet on the ice floes is clearly visible. It is without the help of Deep Blue's powerful magic eye array. The great magic guides on the scene can also see the polar mainland parliamentary flag flying on the fleet with their own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fleet, regardless of its size or combat power, is unprecedentedly powerful. A giant ship with a length of several hundred meters is completely an ancient beast floating only on the sea. Even if they are far apart, the pressure of the monks is still coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the big magician's face is not dignified, but has no eccentricities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the always-held Phil Master finally couldn’t help but say: "This is indeed a huge fleet... but those guys won’t I thought that with such a fleet, I could lay down the current dark blue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They may think that His Highness is already gone, and His Royal Highness cannot take this into account. I want to come here for a cheaper one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another big sneer sneered: "Then they are really wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Gold screamed violently: "Whether they are stupid or what, since this team broke into the dark blue, whether for the sake of His Highness, or for His Highness, they are all I don’t want to go back! I’m just taking them to try the power of that thing today!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great magisters were shocked and dissuaded : "Millions can't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't even have a successful test!"<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to use it, don't be in the dark blue! Put the stuff on the hill over there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to take us all Did you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black gold face turned from red to black, and it was almost mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time even Phil Masters stood on the side of the magical guide, which made Black Gold unable to roar. But suddenly he turned his eyes and laughed a few times and said, "It's already safe! It's too late to say anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several great mages Surprised, they rushed to the edge of the platform and looked down. Sure enough, on the fort that slowly explored the tower wall, there was a strange silver machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
