He didn't know that when the fast beast disappeared in the night, Richard had already clearly grasped his route of travel. He did not come to attack, but compared with the five hundred soldiers, there are more important goals. Waiting for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard is standing on a small hill outside the port city, overlooking this bustling city. Only the baron can be regarded as a city, and the population of over 10,000 can be regarded as a large-scale city even if it is placed in Noland. In fact, because the food of this plane is more abundant, and human beings dominate in many races, there are more urban populations than Noland. There are about 500 guard militiamen in the Baron City, which are led by a sealed knight, mostly one or two soldiers. This level is actually similar to a natural strong man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard holds a map in his hand and points two points on the map with a pen. This is where the fast beast returns to the volatility of consciousness. He connected the two points and then extended forward, eventually falling into the town of Jovan. In general, Richard knew that it would take about two hours for the team to get to the town of Jovan. So Richard turned and said to everyone who was resting in the hills in various ways: "A rest for one hour! We will act after an hour!" The strength of the 500 ordinary soldiers is not strong, but in urban warfare, It is still very threatening when the opponent is at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aural whistle and said: "Hey, if there is a beautiful woman, start with a light hand and try to catch it!" The elf's words attracted a lot of men. They all showed a smile, and the sand and the water were expressionless. Drifting sand is not the right thing, and splashing is also inappropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a little, did not pay attention to the elf's teasing, but silently in the consciousness of the other rapids. They were wandered by Richard in a designated area, and the Baron’s army could not escape their surveillance as long as they went out. These fast beasts also knew the location of Richard, so they came to meet at night. Their own combat power is equivalent to a six-level warrior. Under the cover of the night and the complex terrain of the city, with the sensitive perception and instinct of the beast, the combat power will be improved by one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, all the fast beasts returned to Richard. At this moment, the mother's nest sent another message: all the bears have been eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a slight glimpse. This time, the time spent on the nest is a bit too much. Now there are six power-type beasts around the nest. And the brood's own combat power can already regulate the jazz-level enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to think about this, the scheduled attack time has arrived. At 10 o'clock in the evening, most people in the port city have already slept, and those who drink and drink should be drunk. There will be no more than 50 garrison patrols at night, and the rest should go back to sleep or go home to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a wave of Richard, the group dive to the port city. Now belongs to an extraordinary period, the defense of the port city is very strict, but this level of defense is in the eyes of Richard, in fact, there is not much difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a hidden wall, the ogre was standing under the wall and sent the elf and the three stepping knights. Only a five-meter-high wall, three-pointed with one-handed arms, can almost push a person to the city. Shuihua and Gangde jumped directly, and the hand was on the edge of the city wall and went to the city. Richard added a floating technique to himself and then jumped directly to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
