A fearsome armed force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand more knights, nearly 200 candidate knights, is also a backbone in the floating island giants, plus Richard itself Some elite knights and up to 150 riders of the Knights of the Knights, the power he now has can be said to have been close to Gotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unit is in the hands of Richard, which is particularly frightening, because in the battle against the Earl of Berinov, Richard showed The incredible commanding ability, this is the first time the new owner of the Archimonde family has tried a small knife in the civil war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in terms of top-level combat power, Richard still lacks, and is a big lack, when Gordon and the thirteen knights are in, The legendary strongmen are not willing to easily provoke this group of madmen. Richard’s own team needs time to grow. The only knights that Gordon has left are Lina and Richard, who are still close, and Achilles and Senma are still at a distance. Seldon and the boxing fighters did not even listen to Richard’s orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard was so busy that he almost fell into the lord’s business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to reorganize the army, contact supplies and equipment, the most troublesome thing for him is how to arrange the guardian of the Black Rose Castle. This castle is not allowed. Loss, its meaning is almost equal to a plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are repeated trade-offs, and Richard decided to put the Dragon Master here. Lina can easily manipulate the wrath of Discra, and she is also the thirteenth of the Gordon era. One of the knights was more able to get the approval of the free Archimonde soldiers, and the small lords of Ashan also expressed their due respect to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Richard will also rebuild a series of transmission arrays in the Black Rose Castle, including the transfer to the floating island, the various planes and the dark blue. In the construction of the transmission array, Lina is also the best choice. At the same time, Richard also sent messengers to negotiate with several small aristocrats in the immediate vicinity of Ashan, trying to buy or replace their territories in order to The Privilege Territory won from the Earl of Cardiff merged together. As a result, the Yuanwang Peninsula will extend a tentacles extending beyond the mainland, which can serve as a buffer zone and an outpost, making it easier to deploy military Defense, in addition, by the size of the area, barely reached a count of the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard was busy, a message was passed from FS to the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this news, Richard sent a half-day stay, and then only hurriedly told the followers to supervise the work according to the scheduled plan, and they brought it on. The four-headed griffin continued to fly to the fascinating world in a day-to-night manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the magical array of Black Rose Castle leading to Faust has not been repaired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Griffin fell on the floating island of Archimonde, and Richard went straight to the Eternal Dragon Hall. In the Dragon Hall, he wished to see the Vatican . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"大神官..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just opened and was interrupted by Vatican "" Richard, you are also coming for the rumors of Modred and your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Gordon Archimonde Come." Richard corrected the name of Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin looked at Richard and suddenly sighed and said: "Licha, there is a problem between you and Gotton, we are all able to see, But Gordon has paid a lot for you, and now, what kind of hatred should be resolved, after all... he is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a whitish whit, the body swayed, only the sound can still maintain normal, except that the speed of speech slowed a lot, saying: "You mean, he is already dead."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least the scene I saw in the backtracking of time, this is the case." Vatican said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is silent. I don't know what I am thinking. In the silent hall, I can hear his heavy heartbeat. Let's take a look, like the drums of the ancient barbarian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard looked up again, his face was calm and his voice was calm: "The body of Gordon was taken away by Modred." "Where did he go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin was hesitating, and Richard also saw Vatican’s hesitation, and said, "What do you care about? I need to know the news and I am willing to pay for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline sighed again and said, "If you must know If you pay, then pay the corresponding price, a top sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." Richard answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, Richard, does this make sense, you just know their destination, and now you can't go." Vatican persuaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you can't go now, you can always go in the future, and I have already been to the battlefield. I believe there are not many places that can't be gone." Richard said it was very indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is more terrible than the absolute battlefield," Vatican said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "No matter where it is, I have to go once. I am not because of anything else, just for Gordon." King of Kemond, such a person, should go back to the family cemetery to sleep, nothing more, and this is also my responsibility now, so you don't have to worry about me, and I will send you the sacrifice immediately. Now, please tell me where Modred went with Gordon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bottom of the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the abyss, when Richard heard the word, he also lost some of his heart. This is a bit familiar, but completely strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be familiar with it because Noland is no stranger to the two powerful planes of the abyss and hell. There is a whole row of bookshelves in the dark blue library. The details of the two worlds, that is because the legendary Master often visits the abyss and hell, and because of her frequent visits, she is deeply hated by a large number of big lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard knows that the abyss, like hell, are divided into many layers. Each floor has a large lord who rules everything. In this environment, the great lord has almost the power to fight with the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows how many layers the abyss and hell are divided into. Some say it is hundreds of layers, and some say there are thousands of layers, although most often The argument is that the abyss has no bottom, and the number of layers will change constantly, while the nine domains of Hell, although there are more layers, belong to nine fields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is actually more of an academic hypothesis, no matter how many numbers or how they are defined, it’s just speculation from scholars. The oldest literary dictionary has some ambiguous records, most of which look more like legends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of information is that the adventurers’ words are spoken, and the strong ones who are exploring and lucky enough to bring back records are not just seeing That is a small corner of the vast world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the power of His Highness His Highness, she can’t give accurate layers. She often visits dozens of levels in the two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the abyss, Noland is now unclear about how many layers of the abyss, and the mainstream space school also assumes that the bottom of the abyss is often changing, and How do you know what the bottom of the abyss is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is there?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is said that there is the deepest part of the world of crystal walls, the place where the power of eternal and timeless dragons has never touched. It is a strange world. I have my own rules and are very vast. I know only so much, but I suggest that you can look for a crystal called Aungs tears, which is the only crystal that will appear at the bottom of the abyss. Perhaps you can understand the mystery of the bottom of the abyss, but the tears of Anbis are rarely seen in Noland. Every tear of Anbis is the product of the legendary strongman, and its value is about ten. Bethel's arachnid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin's words, regardless of name, description, or number, are so heavy that people can't breathe, Richard finally Nodded and said: "I know." He left the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a top sacrifice was sent to the Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
