			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to you?" The sand was panicked again, but the magic was detected. As a result, there was no response from Richard. This means that Richard does not need treatment or purification. However, Richard's willpower has always been extraordinary, only to see the painful color that he now clearly shows, and the sand can feel the torture he is experiencing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Richard has been occupied by the pain, and he can’t hear what the sand is saying. It was an indescribable pain, as if the soul was tearing, and some of the painkillers on the ** were all ineffective. When the pain reached the extreme, Richard even used his head to hit the wall of the carriage. But the little bit of pain in the head was completely negligible, and it didn't help Richard to resist the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand has been completely flustered, and she threw Clark and Io in all while throwing the known magical skills on Richard. All the followers of Richard also got the news, gathered around the carriage, looked at the Richard who was twitching on the carriage floor, everyone was helpless, and in order not to shake the heart, they still have to make too much The look of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him’s marching position is closest to Richard’s side, and he is also the first of the nobility generals to discover the situation, although the followers are in the outer ring. . But he obviously saw something, and suddenly became smart. Not only did he retreat himself, but he also fled a few and felt that the coalition commander had an unusual general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of the sand is completely ineffective, and the magic of Clark and Io is naturally not useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Necromancer gave himself a psychic eye, and his eyes were covered with a strange grayish white. Then I looked at Richard with the eyes of the dead. After a while, I suddenly said, "The master is undergoing some kind of transformation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Sandru said There is no change in what Richard is doing, but his words make everyone a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing you can do now is wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, after a few minutes, the symptoms of Richard’s body twitching slowly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the depths of Richard’s consciousness, he is watching his own soul. It was a group of uncertain light, surrounded by many different forces. At this moment, a part of Richard’s soul is gradually bulging, then splits and squeezes out a milky white spot. Compared to the whole soul, this little light spot is much smaller, like a candle next to a campfire. At the moment when the light spot appeared, Richard suddenly felt a strange feeling, like a pair of eyes, but also opened a window in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness of Richard, there is a second voice, a consciousness that can think independently and judge independently. This conscious thinking is not as fast as the original consciousness of having two levels of wisdom, but it is twice as large as the average person, and has reached a fairly intelligent level among ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally understood what happened. It turned out that the brain was intensified for a long time, and Richard’s wisdom talent was re-advanced to become a third. The third level does not raise the speed of thinking of the subject of the Lord, but instead derives a consciousness that can handle affairs independently! From now on, Richard can achieve real distraction! It is only the process of splitting consciousness that is really painful. The whole process is equivalent to tearing the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the new consciousness was stable, Richard recovered to be awake and struggled to get up. Everyone was relieved to see him recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha felt a sudden exhaustion in his heart, only hurriedly confessed that he was okay, he could not help but fall asleep. When he woke up, it was dusk, and he was lying in the camp. The two consciousnesses woke up at the same time, and the repeated world became a double-overlapping shadow, which made Richard very uncomfortable, and finally adjusted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the problem facing Richard is to let this new consciousness do something. Instead of rushing to get out of bed, he lay back on the bed, sorting out the things that need to be done in the short, medium and long term, and then reclassifying them according to their priorities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has drawn a cross in the consciousness, the horizontal is important, the vertical is urgent, if it is simple, Richard only needs to be important and urgent Pick a few pieces out of the matter and hand it over to the second consciousness to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the selection, Richard decided to let the second consciousness continue to study the sacred fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal dragon temple’s sacred fighting techniques are high and deep, and there are only a few dozen basic movements, but there are thousands of combinations, and then consider the environment. It is endless. The same fighting technique is in the hands of two different people, and the power can be different. Richard knows that even with the wisdom of talent and the teaching of quicksand, there is still a considerable gap between his own official fighting and Iowa. The reason why the battle won on that day was actually that Li was dare to work hard and it was really lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of sacred fighting is not to fight the wind with Iraq, and Richard has a deeper consideration. This is pure warfare. It is a direct improvement of personal strength. Although it is not as large as the level, it is the most direct and effective way to improve beyond the level and structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the top-level combat skills have the commonality at the peak, Richard has found that with the tempering of combat techniques, his body's flexibility and flexibility are improved. The use of the Elf Sword is also smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret sword that motivates the seven-stringed moon force is a set of martial arts that is quite different from the conventional ones. Since the day of Gordon’s inheritance, Richard has also studied it. However, it seems that the advancement of the secret sword does not rely on repeated practice, nor does it have any strict requirements. Each time the martial arts used is strong, one is from the strong force of the moon, and the other is the strength of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee thus draws a conclusion that is not a conclusion, perhaps the Elf Sword is a set of combat skills that will be stronger when used by the strong. But he has never had the chance to get top martial arts to prove his guess, and the traditional martial arts method is not suitable for a legal person to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the promotion of sacred fighting is an incomparably onerous task. Richard used the main consciousness to estimate the time needed, and discovered even the second consciousness day and night. Constantly deducing comprehension, I am afraid that at least for hundreds of years at the current speed of thinking! How can Richard have hundreds of years of life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not hesitate and immediately began to comprehend the second consciousness. Every step forward in the sacred fighting art, Richard's personal strength will advance accordingly. No matter in the bloody land, in Nolande or anywhere else, superb combat skills and powerful force always mean extra life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing this, Richard felt a little hungry, so he walked out of the camp and summoned the followers and the Viscounts of Him, while using dinner, while Learn about the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
