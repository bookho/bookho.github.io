			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have worked tirelessly to come from all over the country. Even the sacred dynasty and the millennial empire have come to many people. Because of the long distance, they are all flying all the way to World of Warcraft, which is extremely hard. Even in countries that are hostile to the alliance, they have all sent agents. Afterwards, there is no reliable first-hand information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great empire, the more ordinary builders mean the larger the team of knights. If a royal master is a breakthrough, it means that the strength of the empire's strongmen is greatly enhanced. Therefore, Lunuo's installation conference can be said to have touched the nerves of many major forces, and even some aliens are trying to get some information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luno’s installation conference was held in the Great Hall of the Public Architecture of the largest public building in the world, and occupied a complete partial hall. The Great Hall of Glory is as long as the history of FS, and it is also one of the buildings that existed when the fascination was discovered. In history, there have been countless grand events in the Great Hall of Glory, from concerts to costume launches. Over time, the Great Hall of Glory has been stipulated as a special venue for the Royal Assembly to publicly release the structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the official press conference, there was also the most proud student of Luno Master, Feng Ster's installation conference. Although from the notice, Fengster only took out the ordinary second-order structure, but it means that since then, the Holy Alliance has added another builder, and the strategic strength has increased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many people are interested in Fengster, most of them just for Luno. Everyone knows that among the three major human empire of the mainland, the history of the Holy Alliance is the shortest and the shallowest, so the field of construction has always lagged behind the other two empires. Once Luno is made into a fourth-order structure, he can greatly compensate for the shortcomings of the Holy Alliance. And Lunuo’s breakthrough will also make his disciples progress even bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just the day before the Luno conference was scheduled to be held, another explosive news spread quickly. Richard of the Archimonde family also wants to hold his own assembly conference on the same day!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, this is just a new constructor It’s just a ceremony for public opinion, and there’s nothing good about this kind of conference. However, what is shocking is that the press conference of Richard is also held in the Great Hall of Glory. It also occupies a magnificent partial hall, which is exactly the face of Luno’s conference! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people keenly sniffed out the unusual meaning, and the interest in Richard immediately rose. Soon, Richard's vast amount of information spread quickly, and it spread more quickly than the plague of the Necromancer. The most talked about is the evaluation of the 'future sect.' It sounds ridiculous, but this is the evaluation given by the legendary Master Su Hailun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, only a very small number of people will know how much the evaluation given by His Highness is unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard himself, in fact, did not anticipate this scene in advance. When Nolan personally sent the time and place of the conference to him, Richard found that he not only held a press conference with Luno on the same day, but also on the same venue! Luno is open-minded and will inevitably regard this as an unacceptable provocation. Moreover, Luno has never had such a generous reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning the invitation of the conference over and over again, Richard looked up and stared at the eyes of Nolan’s priest and said, “Respected Nolan sergeant, you seem very willing to see me and Luno master standing opposite, and the relationship between them is irreconcilable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
