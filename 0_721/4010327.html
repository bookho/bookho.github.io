Qi Qi now has the potential of a builder, it is not a How big the secret is, so the abstention of Mensa and Schumpeter is obviously not willing. Finally, the person who shot you on the same day, the injury can not be healed, it is impossible to return to the sanctuary in this life, even if he is willing to pay the cost, It will not exceed 14 or 5 at most. So, are you satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, if indeed, as Nero said, then Mensa also paid a heavy price for his own non-compliance. Now, the cost seems to be a bit lighter, but Richard at that time is not the one who can make life guidance and secret guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I admit that you are right in this matter, indeed the royal family has helped me a lot." Richard admitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero’s eyes are appreciative, then say: “Actually, I mean, Richard, you can’t think of yourself as an ordinary person now, as now You can overwhelm Luno's royal architect. You should think of yourself as a giant, even if it is not as powerful as the floating island giants, but it is not far behind. At the same time, you are the patriarch of Archimonde, although now Your power has not yet left Faust, but we all believe that the unification of Archimonde is only a matter of time, then the question is coming, Richard, you see which giant will do his best to support a certain prince. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Richard, and when I think about it, I found out that it was exactly what Nero said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Duke of Iron and Blood, can be tied with the royal family on the fifth floor of the floating island, the family strength is not much worse than the royal family, if he fully supports a certain prince That would have long been a suspense, but in fact, only Agamemnon stood on the side of Nyres on the Grand Duke, and he could only use the resources that belonged to the individual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young man who has no title, no land, and no private plane, Agamemnon is no exception, and the resources available are limited. The role played by Nyres is also very limited. Of course, Nyris has not had much resources. The two of them struggled together for almost three years, but they only made up for five. Install the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sorrow of the lord-type characters. Resources, forces, and talents all need to accumulate a little bit. Time is always an obstacle that cannot be crossed, and the strong ones who rely solely on personal terrorism like White Night are much faster in the early stages. However, in the later period, as the personal strength of the strong is gradually approaching the bottleneck, the overall strength will be gradually caught up by the lord-type characters, surpassing, and even far behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big lord who is backed by one or more planes, the forces are not comparable to the ordinary strong, so two different types of heroes, development The first route is slower before the first, and the other is slower before and after, but it also has advantages and disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lords are often distracted by everything, which affects the improvement of personal strength. For example, Richard will spend a lot of time to draw the structure and Nanzheng North. War, but when the individual strong is in the late stage, the resources needed are becoming more and more huge and rare. In order to cultivate more peace of mind, it is often necessary to attach to a certain force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many strong people, even legendary powerhouses, will choose one side to rely on, and of course there are some alternatives, such as Gordon, this volcanic man Pursuing a crazy expansion strategy, his power has also expanded at a speed not seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as white nights, it can’t be measured by the standard of ordinary personal strength. She is destined to embark on the legendary road of exploring the plane in the future, and finally it is Su Helen, the deep blue created by the great legendary mage, is itself a huge force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the great giants’ support for the emperor has its own emphasis, but they are also very cautiously reserved. The entire family of the Duke of the Iron Age also supports three The prince and a royal girl, Nyris got more relatively, but because of Agamemnon's personal factors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon itself is the greatest support for Nyris, he may not be the most dazzling one in the family of the Dukes of Iron and Blood, but recognized in the near future In the future, Agamemnon will certainly be able to add another branch to the name of Orleans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, like Richard, in a short period of time, he poured tens of millions of resources on Nyres, which caused the soaring strength of the four emperors. According to Nero, this development is unconventional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said, "His Highness means that I should have reservations about the support of Nyris, is it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true." Nero nodded without a twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frown said: "But I am a friend with Nyris, and we signed a joint development agreement, you can't let me have resources. , but don't use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero indulged and said: "This is indeed a problem, but it is not a solution, I have a suggestion. The part that you have already cooperated with Nyris is going on like this. We also respect the friendship between you and Nyris, but next, I hope that you can treat the competition between the princes as a wealthy leader." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what should I do?" Richard crossed his fingers, his elbows on the table, his body leaning forward slightly, smiling and asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, your resources can be opened, especially the resources of the building class. I believe many of us will give better conditions than Nyris. Of course, in the case of similar conditions, you choose Nyris is understandable, I believe that many of us need only a fairer opportunity, and this is also good for Nyris, because it is smooth, for young people Growth is not good." Nero said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is sincere and gentle, just as friendly and harmless as his appearance, and people are willing to listen, "for example, in determining the qualification of the heirs. There are two kinds of personal force and the same strength to fight against each other. This kind of assessment can only be on their own, and the most important one is to equip all the emperors with the same strength, and then put them into a strange plane. In a year's time, whoever develops the fastest and best, who can get higher scores, Richard, I think you know very well, the purpose of these selections is to eliminate those flowers grown up in the greenhouse. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "This is true, but there is a lot of cooperation between me and Nyris. I can also consider investing resources in other Plane, but first, I need absolute control, I think, such conditions are not acceptable to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero also admitted, said : "It is true, but I believe that someone will be willing to come up with his private plane. And there are opportunities, and no choice at all is two different things, and I have another request now, I hope you can help me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I try my best." It is said that this is another unanswered answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to ask you to order a second-order suit for one of my friends." Nero solemnly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed and said: "Customized second-order suit, this is no worse than my support for Neris so far, what are you going to use? To exchange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero said: "I heard that you have to hold an auction recently, I will pay according to the price of the final auction, if at auction On the basis of the price, I can give me some discounts a little, and I value this friendship very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and said: "10% off. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you very much." Nero's face was slightly bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manual cost of the custom second-order set is likely to be auctioned to a high price of five million, which does not include the number of copies of the material that needs to be provided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The custom-made auction of such equity auctions is usually divided into two parts, one is pure design and manual costs, and the other is how many materials are provided. Adding the two parts together, the total price of this set of second-order suits is likely to reach ** million. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a 10% discount, Richard’s is equivalent to giving up hundreds of thousands of benefits, and with the rapid advancement of Richard’s level of construction, his time will be It's getting more and more expensive, and you can't book it with just gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "The second Highness, I have heard that you are very talented. Now the points are ranked first among the emperors, so It’s not going to be a set of second-order suits.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero laughed: “Just for the second-order suit, Richard, you It’s too small to look at myself. Your suit has already made me bankrupt.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and extended to Nero. Hand: "If there is a chance in the future, I don't mind directly draining you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero’s eyes brightened and held Richard’s hand: “Welcome ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pairs have their own characteristics, but they are equally hot and powerful, and they are like two steel bars that are opposite each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
