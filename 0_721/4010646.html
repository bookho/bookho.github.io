			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a night, a burly middle-aged man walks alone in the world On the road of Germany, it is particularly eye-catching. He is tall and has a skeleton with sharp edges and corners. His body is covered with a common civilian robes, and the short, hairy hair is erected like a steel needle. The beard on his face looks like a few days. Not shaved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the power of Dahan is not obvious. It seems that even the sanctuary has not arrived, but the numerous killers who lie in the dark see him, but inexplicably feel Unrest, but where the restlessness originated, these sacred domains and even the legendary tyrannical killers are unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many of them were given orders to discover that any suspicious targets were not removed by identification, but until the big man crossed the entire Favord, there was no one. When people shoot, they will find out a bunch of reasons why they should not be shot if they are born with a killing heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many killers who watched this strange face of the great man on the stairway leading to the Eternal Dragon Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is willing to admit that he did not shoot because of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a dark night, and the rainbow that is only six rounds of the moon is also dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man has long legs and great steps, but when he went up the mountain, he went up to the first level and did not miss any level. Steps, although he is not strong, he naturally has a kind of arrogance in the world, which makes people clearly feel that he is so honestly picking up the ranks. It is not a respect for the Eternal Dragon Temple, but a kind of commemoration. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan walked to the front door of the Eternal Dragon Palace, stepping through the hall, a young female priest saw him, didn’t feel a glimpse, walked quickly Come, ask: "Now the time is already very late. If you want to sacrifice, you need to do it tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan is dressed in an ordinary but unparalleled manner Let the goddess officer not dare to neglect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan looked at the goddess officer and suddenly said: "When you tell Vatican, I said that I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply a word that has no words. If someone changes it, the goddess officer will immediately call the Knights of the Temple and directly blast him out, but the big man said, but she naturally answered, and hurriedly The exclusive temple of Vatican ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the disease, the goddess’s heart also had a trace of doubts, and did not understand why he would obey this big man who had never seen him before. It is as if the big man is her master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young goddess ran all the way to the temple of Vatican, scorning the door of the temple, and the soft voice of Vatican sounded in the door: "He is coming." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess officer was confused and instinctively replied: "Yes, he has already arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Vatican in the temple said, "Well, I know, go on, I will go see him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young goddess officer under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall of the Eternal Dragon Hall, the middle-aged man stood with his hand and casually looked at the gorgeous decoration in the hall with a long-lasting atmosphere, except for normal The burly man is still taller than the height of the whole head. He does not see anything special from him, but he is standing in the hall, and neither the priest nor the knight of the temple consciously circumvented him. No one went to the front, as if there was nothing wrong with this big man standing there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Vatican walked out of the temple and suddenly saw it when he saw the middle-aged man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man also saw Vatican, then smiled heartily and said, "Why, I can’t recognize me, thirty years. Before, I am not like this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin stood up, tears ran down, but she was unaware, just shivering: Philip..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darhan touched the cock on the chin and said, "Oh, I forgot, thirty years have passed, I It is getting old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin suddenly flew, leaped, plunged into the arms of the big man, clenched him hard, his hands almost fell into him As the iron muscles go, choked and said: "No, you are exactly the same as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears couldn’t stop the flood, and the robes on Phillip’s chest were wet in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philippe holding Vatican, gently stroking her hair, said: "You have not changed, I almost thought that these thirty years have not In the past, it just made a dream "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Vatican Lin refused to look up, hands are trembling, tightly clutching Philip, you do not even Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, Philip said first: "Take me to the place where you are staying now. I still have some time, we can talk for a while, in addition, I miss Tick town very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, there was a scene in the temple of Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small town surrounded by mountains and waters. There is a small but quite stylish tavern in the town, and Vatican and Philip are sitting small. On the open-air seating outside the pub, I smiled at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it was the first time that Philip and Vatican had come across the adventure, all the details were recorded in the heart of Vatican. With her ability at this time, and in the temple built by the power of time and space, all the pieces that are remembered will be reproduced in reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty years have passed, time has not left any traces on Vatican, but Philip has had vicissitudes and nicks on his face, now Philip, can't say handsome, but has an indescribable manner. It seems to be the heroic self-knowledge that will finally embark on the peak of humanity. In Philip's Sanctuary, which appeared in the town of Tick, it was not. This wonderful kind of temperament has already existed. As for the once fat, it will only appear on Emperor Philippe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin looked at Philip and smiled and said, "You are old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Philip did not hide his emotions and said with emotion: "Yes, it is really old. I let the appearance fade with time. I am afraid that you are immersed in the space of the temple, forgetting the passing time, but you have nothing at all. Change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin smiled lightly and said, "I don't change, I am afraid that you can't recognize me."<br /><br />&nbsp ; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Philip god mouth, huh laughing, pointed to his heart and said:. "you are here, will not admit" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican gave him a white glance and said, "I don't know how to change the pattern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp caught the head and smiled and said, "No. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet for a moment, Vatican said: "How come you... suddenly came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I thought I could wait for a hundred years, but I only couldn't help but want to see you after waiting for thirty years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin's head Suddenly lowered, suddenly a drop of water drops from her face, smashed on the back of the hand, but her voice did not change, calmly asked: "I heard that you were framed by some people. "Is that the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philips smiled low and waved with a big hand, just like sweeping away some insect ants dust, and did not care to say: "Just by those idiots, there are still some conspiracy to win me. I just can't stand the day when I wait alone. I just have to find a chance to fight twice, and then give myself a reason to see you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin put her hand in the big hand of Philip, and the head still did not lift, just said: "You fool, only thirty years, how? I can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been here for thirty years, and you may be three hundred years, five hundred years, how can you let me go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin’s temple is like the sand-sanding hall of the sand. It has the ability to adjust the time freely. In the outside, the temple may have been ten years old. The two generations of the gods suppressed themselves in the same way, hoping to be temporarily numb in the passage of time, in exchange for a brief calm, but no matter how the time is washed away, the pain in the heart is as clear as the anchored beacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are two, one is like a year, one is like a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Lin put both hands in the hands of Philip and whispered, "What do you need me to do on the Holy Alliance?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philipp shook his head and said, "I have laid the foundation for the rising sun, even if I am worthy of my ancestors and the entire race, I don’t want to worry about other things. Let them go, the dead is damn, only the lion who survives can become the king of beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
