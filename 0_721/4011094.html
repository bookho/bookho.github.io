			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the place that should have been the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred in armor In front of one knee, he took a knight's ceremony and said calmly: "The blood of Archimonde is flowing in the head. Although in the last 10,000 years, the name of Archimonde is not the strongest in the abyss. The race is even difficult to get into the first class, but the abyss is still the most fundamental source of the life mark. Here, the Abyss of Abys is the end of all abyss and the origin of all abyss. The Lord of Abyss Is the supreme of all the abyss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha licked his lips and listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I came here with my head, only in the land of eternal jihad, the field of Abis's will, the blood of the abyss that was taken care of. The thing was simple, the head was resurrected, and then the head and I came here to kill the last abyss, and the head became the Lord of the abyss." Modred's tone is very relaxed, Richard I feel that every word is heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred continues: "Become the abyss of Abyss, then the blood of Archimonde will regain the favor of the abyss, in the future In the years, there will be the big lord of Archimonde, and his blood in the world will become stronger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly clenched Punch, let go, spit out a breath, "Why should he intercept me? Put me in the past, or directly explain, isn't it better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mo Dred shrugged and said: "That is the head, but it is the will of the Abyss. The guarding the passage, and maintaining the stability of the eternal blood battlefield, are the two responsibilities of the Lord of the Abyss, and the overwhelming instinct. If you want to cross the passage, the head must stop you. You are fighting with the abyss, not fighting with the head, and you can't recognize you at that time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the chill in his eyes and said, "Since you are very clear, why not tell me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred smiled a few times and turned to look at him. His eyes were dark and dark with no stars. "Tell you what to do, let the head kill?" I said that at that time, the head did not have his own consciousness. He was only the embodiment of the abyss will. But if you know the identity of the head, will you fight hard? If you hesitate, you will die in the hands of the abyss. Now, this ending is actually very good, and the head has long wanted to be free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard silently said for a long time, "If this is the case... then why should he sit in this position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said After that, it is for Archimonde! You know, the head is such a person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha faintly thinks that he may know that he will occasionally be in the soul The huge and terrifying will that I felt in the depths came from. Even in the deepest part of the world, this man is always watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and looked up at the huge whirlpool in the sky. Now the invisible barrier that blocks the vortex has been greatly weakened. Through the vortex, you can see that the other end of the channel is crowded with countless odd shapes and can't tell what it is. They are crowded with each other and desperately rush out of the whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Richard finally understands why Abis Abyss will regard the guardian channel as his instinct. The abyss is not only to prevent the passage of creatures on one side of the world's light, but more to prevent the terrible things of the dark side from rushing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, am I going to be the Lord of the Abyss?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is far from the world barrier, and he is unexpectedly calm, but can’t help but feel a little regret. Once he became the Lord of the Abyss, he will be assimilated by the abyss will, like Gotton, and will always sit on the cold throne, perhaps thousands of years later, defeated by another demon or demonic. This is the natural responsibility of the Creature of Light, but there are still too many things that Richard has not done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medred smiled and said, "I am sorry, His Highness, Richard, this position is not yet available for you. According to the established rules, Abis The position of the Lord of the Abyss should be taken care of by the devil and the devil. So the next Lord of the Abyss is me, not you. The name of Modred, in Hell, is equivalent to Archimonde now in the abyss." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked deep into Mordred and solemnly said, "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mordred laughed in a low voice and said, "Don't thank me. The head has fulfilled the responsibility and finally got rid of it. You can do your thing, and I can stay here, quietly recall and Those times when the heads are together. Very good results, aren't they?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modred raised his hand and pointed his finger at the passage leading to the dark side of the world. He said, "Go back soon, your time is running out. I can still hold on for a while before I am assimilated by the abyss. If I am delayed For a long time, when you come back, maybe you have to work with me. At that time, whether it is killing me or killing me, I am afraid it is not a good thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and picked up the armor left by Gordon, and a flash, he returned to Faust. He looked at the countless ugly monsters on the other side of the channel, stunned, his face flashed with resolute color, and said: "Power is full! We ran over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Shide slowly moved, and the rainbow began to bloom in July, almost illuminating the entire Abyss abyss! When a huge city begins to accelerate, the kind of power is completely unstoppable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning into a burning star, fascinating against the abyss channel, Modred is also a stunned look. Until the fascinating rush into the abyss channel, relying on its own unparalleled power to completely crush the ugly creatures in the dark, Mordred said, "This is OK?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of crossing the world channel, everyone's vision immediately darkened, and in a blink of an eye it became completely black, and the numerous ugly creatures that had just been crushed disappeared. There is no light around, no sound, nothing, it is a world of nothingness, death, darkness and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainbow is still shining in July, forming a thin film of light that wraps the entire volcanic world. This behemoth city is now like a boat in a soap bubble, drifting helplessly in the dark sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dark side of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha feels that many followers are fearful and heart-wrenching, and most of them have never had such an experience. Except for the light on the fauna, nothing can be seen outside, and it is not perceived. In such a dark and silent world, the determined strong will soon go crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has been to the dark areas, but has an understanding of the situation at hand. The dark side of the world is not empty. It also has its own rules, but the rules on one side of the light cannot be used here. Only by adapting and controlling the rules of the dark side can we perceive the world here. Just as in the darkness, only by controlling the twisting rules can we see the true essence of that world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark side and the glossy side are the two sides of the world. Controlling the rules here is actually much easier than the twisting rules of the dark areas. In the real world, Richard has seen the flow of energy, and a line of rules is also emerging in the dark. I believe that it will take a long time for Richard to control the rules of the dark side, at least not to be a blind man and a blind man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will then pass on his ideas to followers and let them gradually settle down. At this moment, the faceless voice sounded in Richard’s consciousness: "The energy of the floating world has been losing, and there is no supplement. If you want If we don't have a way, we can drift here permanently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parsing the rules of the dark side, then adjusting the energy capture mode of FS, not Is it ok?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face lazy and said: “It’s so easy! Well, then the little things of parsing the rules are handed over to you. You resolve the rules of the dark side, and I will adjust the energy capture mode of FS. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "It is not difficult to analyze this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Richard established the first analytical model, but he did not calculate by himself, but linked the mountains and the sea, will all The model and data were passed to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl is actually the mother's nest now, she is sitting on the top of a shrine in the floating world, and some look at the dark and dead world. The model and data passed by Richard were transferred to a node in the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of Faust, there is a rather large lake. This piece of green water, such as the emerald ring, was originally part of the city's scenery, but now the lake is boiling, and a strange creature is carrying a load in the lake. It is like a dozen giant brains connected together, each with a diameter of ten meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the newly created thinking unit of the Brood. It has no fighting ability, but it has huge computing power. This is also one of the backhands that Richard has prepared for this trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and Sea directly transferred the model and data to this specially created giant thinking center, and they continued to stare in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
