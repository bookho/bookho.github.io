			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard walked out of the room, the old butler’s deep eyes swept over the cocoa, then Stretched the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When accompanied by Richard, the old butler asked: "Master Li, since cocoa is already your partner, then let her move In the main castle, live in your room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had wanted to answer it at random, but when he walked out of the building, he suddenly saw a handsome standing not far away. The young man, the one who rushed upstairs last night. His age seems to be slightly larger than that of Richard. At the age of 20, his body is well-proportioned. Although there is no exaggerated muscle, the whole gives a feeling of strength. In addition, he has a handsome face full of sunshine, and a pair of pure and enthusiastic eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing this young man last night, Richard knew that he was a stepping knight and was a reserve agent for the knight. If the power can grow to carry four structures in the next two to three years, it will become a real knight. If not, it will be sent to other places to become a lower-level officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reserve of the Archimonde family has a young man from the side of the branch, as well as an elite who has been selected from the outside and trained from an early age. Richard did not see him at the dinner of the young family, indicating that the young man probably did not belong to Archimonde, or just a child with a very distant bloodline and no background. In other words, he does not have a partner qualification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped his steps, his eyes narrow and looked at the young man who couldn’t get out of the building. His eyes were cold and indifferent, and the young man's gaze and Richard touched it, turning to the side and turning and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the young man’s back, his face was heavy, and he was indulging for a moment, faintly said to the butler: "No, let her live here!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler nodded, nothing else, not as much as the young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the floating island transmission square, a small team is already waiting for Richard. Richard has no luggage, only a box of clothes and daily necessities, and a box of materials needed to draw the magic pattern. This time escorting Richard is the Dragon Master Lina, not Modred. In addition to Lina, there are four costume knights and ten light cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team set off quickly, and then in the square in front of the temple in the floating world, Richard saw his first partner in the battle plane, Eternal Dragon The god of the temple, the sand of the 'breaking dawn'. Under the direction of the Vatican's great priest, Richard dismissed the horse and turned to the carriage of the sand. Then the team set off again and went along the winding road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lina saw that the means of running sand was actually a carriage, she couldn’t help but raise her eyebrows, but when she approached, she immediately knew that this was not For the comfort of the trip. Although the appearance is unpretentious, it is the most common aristocratic wagon style, but the additional magic array can close all the information in the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip is far away, time is tight, and the first communication and communication between the two new companions, Richard and Liusha, can only be carried out on the road. There is obviously something to say about the sand. Except for this carriage and two drivers, the drifting sand did not bring any accompanying agents. When they arrived at Port Motfand, they would return to Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decoration in the carriage is simple but not simple. The base color is the pale gold of the Eternal Dragon Hall. As soon as he entered the carriage, Richard felt the vicissitudes of the vicissitudes of his face, as if he were in the Temple of Eternal Dragon. The sand is sitting across from Richard. She looks like a young man with a pale blond hair and a pale gold eyebrow. Because of the color, sometimes I can't see her eyebrows if I don't look carefully. For this reason, the very beautiful flowing sand reveals a strange and mysterious temperament, which makes people think of the ruins of the central part of the eternal dragon temple. In her eyebrows, there are complicated pale gold lines, and it is unclear whether it is the result of a certain magic or a natural pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Liusha, the gods and pastors of the Eternal Dragon Temple. At present, there are eight grades." When Richard took the carriage, he said: Don't be surprised by my name. This is what Mr. Vatican took. I don't know my name because I am a abandoned baby thrown at the door of the Eternal Dragon Hall. My ability is mainly in addition to all kinds of general magic. Eternal and the magic of the Dragon of Time. This is my weapon, the book of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand takes out a thick thick with a pale gold cover The book, looked at Richard. Then she took out a map and opened it in front of Richard. This is a hand-painted map of the port of Mokfand and the surrounding waters, with hundreds of islands scattered across the vast waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand points to one of the islands that clearly deviates from the normal route, saying: "I know that the Marquis of Gordon built a stronghold for you, but not yet It’s time to choose the portal here. This is the location that Vatican’s teacher chose for us. No one knows about it. The island has a large plain and forest, and the necessary deep-water port. The mainland does not. Far away, especially to Mokfand and your Akmend Rose Harbor are not far away. So the portal we can go to the plane can be built here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard nodded and remembered the location of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands took up the map, and took out a dark green crystal and handed it to Richard, saying: "This life crystal can temporarily stabilize the seeds, so you don't have to Take it with you wherever you go. Just put it in the carriage on this road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard collects the crystal, the sand will stop talking. , slowly closed his eyes. When her eyes closed, all the breath of life gradually condensed from her body. When Richard closed his eyes, he could not detect the smell of sand drifting. She seemed to disappear from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and opened his eyes, but he saw the sand flowing and sat upright, not moving. She is not without breath, but has been immersed in the ruins of the time in the carriage, no longer separate from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Liusha has its own unique way of meditation and cultivation. Richard will not bother her any more, but take out a book and watch it seriously. . The journey was long, and the inside and outside of the carriage was like two worlds. I could hardly feel any bumps in the carriage and could not hear anything from the outside world. The book was very slow, and several of the pages were read repeatedly. Too much concentration made him not notice that the sand was not known when he had opened his eyes and was quietly looking at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are watching history?" Liu sand suddenly asked, it was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Richard looked up, smiled and answered, closed the page, and reached out and handed it over. Flowing sand is undoubtedly a very important partner in this plane adventure, so Richard is willing to communicate with her and understand each other. On the real battlefield, the level of understanding and tacit understanding with partners will determine the key link between life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha reached out and took the book in the hands of Richard, and looked at it and said: "The history of the Silver Moon Elf, are you interested in these? Silver Moon The elves are the remains of the ancient elves of the royal elves, but only a few of them are scattered on the continent of Noland. After your father, the Marquis of Gordon, led the army of the Holy Alliance to break through the Everlasting Forest, there is no territory in our humanity. The larger elves are inhabited, and there are only a few scattered elf tribes. If you are interested in the high elves and elf culture, you should go to the green continent in the depths of the western seas of the mainland, where they are ruled by the elves. Or wait for us to come back from the plane, you can also come to the Eternal Dragon Hall, where Vatican has collected a lot of art from the Elven Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
