"Head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard that Richard was going to the absolute battlefield, everyone who had heard of the battlefields in the field screamed, and the plane war was already very cruel. The extremist battlefield is the most extreme and cruelest form in the battlefield, with a mortality rate of more than two-thirds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen the battlefields in the field. Because I have seen it, I know more about the cruelty and terribleness there, so I am a little nervous at the moment. But no matter how fearful he is, he has made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there seems to be a faint warm current in the pocket, and Richard immediately perceives that it is the last piece of fate, so miraculously eliminated Fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and smiled and said: "What are you calling! I am still planning to come back alive. If you can’t come back, it’s not cheap. These guys!? I haven't lived yet, the Pope of the Three Goddesses and the future Popes are waiting for me to go to bed with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War of war, Women are the favorite topic of all males. Sure enough, all the males are in the brain, and they are screaming. Gangde even shouted: "What does the Pope mean! Head, you have to at least put the three goddesses down, that is called a man!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Out, the males have joined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the priests like Iowa and Clark are also very impressed, just because of restraint, I am embarrassed to be as brutal and vulgar as Gangde. For their natural mad believers, the degree of aversion to the ecstasy is far above the devil and the devil. If Richard can kill the gods of the Faro and burn it with the abyss of prison fire forever, it will best suit their minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the woman, the sand is a little unhappy, but just snorted. In the arrangement of Richard, it has already been pointed out that her position is above the people. It is natural to maintain some demeanor and there is no way to see them with these barbarians. Splashing water, I don't know what I am thinking about. Yan Mei is like a man jumping and screaming. If Master Long thought thoughtfully, his face had a slight fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Qi Qi, at this stage, she fully supports all the thoughts of women in the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting ended in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard slept for a day and night, returning his physical strength and spirit to his best, and then quietly walked into the plane portal in an early morning hour. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, the bloody land ushered in a rare storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard only had a short stop at Noland, and he entered the portal to the absolute battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip was kept secret, so only Agamemnon was sent to him. This quiet young man embraced Richard in his ear. Whispered: "Live back! Otherwise, I will have to 'take care of' your women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of sincere blessing, Richard is really a little dumbfounding. Seriously, Richard found that his ‘women’ seemed to be very simple. If Agamemnon wanted to “care”, it might be that he hit a steel plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the transmission array, Richard replied unceremoniously: "You should find more women! If you hang up now, I can't find someone to take care of!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am working hard." Agamemnon replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the two young people laughed and then hugged, and Richard went into the transmission and embarked on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along for a long time after the light of the portal was dispersed, Agamemnon stood still. In the absolute battlefield, anything can happen, and even the most powerful, may never return. When Richard left, Agamemnon didn’t know if he could still see that he was also smiling and stepping out of the portal with the colorful magical light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a period of intense dizziness, Richard groaned in a dark mountain. When the light behind the portal disappeared, the surroundings immediately fell into darkness. Then in his vision, a little bit of fire flashed, and the surrounding environment was also revealed one by one, which is the light of the unknown sand on the mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He observed the surroundings and found that there was no danger at the moment. He sat down and rested quietly waiting for the discomfort from the plane to disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place around where Richard first came is very similar, it seems to be in the same area. In this case, Richard estimated that it would take about a month for him to arrive in the day. There is no white night at this time, and all the dangers encountered on the road have to be borne by myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the vertigo disappeared, Richard began to rearrange his equipment. He now has three full knives and a staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the deepening of Richard’s analysis of the sacred fighting techniques, three long-cut knives of different natures have an important role in different occasions, and As the cornerstone of surgery, it is integrated into one. Therefore, Richard considered it over and over again, and chose to bring all the knives so that he could exert his full strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he once again raised the idea of ​​finding an equipment space container. The way the body is covered with weapons is not so powerful, it is more like an active weapon rack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked like the last time, picked some strong moss, applied it to himself, and also wiped some of the weapons to suppress The taste of Rand. Then Richard took a few deep breaths, gradually converges the atmosphere, ignites the natural blood, and integrates himself with the surrounding environment, then rushes along the dark passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it took a long time for Richard to find an exit to the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the natural light entering from the hole shines on the face of Richard’s face, and a fierce wind suddenly comes from behind! The wind also carries a unique bandit, and the image of the mouse demon appears in the heart of Richard. Last time he and the White Nights killed more than ten mouse devils, and they were familiar with the structure and smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect the mouse to appear in the channel, and it’s very embarrassing, until the moment when Richard’s vision was affected, he suddenly started to fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the sound, the light in the channel suddenly increased by a thousand times! A light ball rises from the top of Richard's head. In addition to the light ball in the passage, I can't see anything anymore! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse devil screamed, and immediately the eyes were white, and the rushing head naturally turned, and slammed into the hole. And Richard is no longer in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse's sense of smell and hearing are equally acute. They can also rely on sound positioning like a bat, so visual impairment only interferes at that moment and has little effect on their actions. The mouse devil slammed into the air, and the body bounced, and actually hung directly on the wall of the hole, and prepared for the next fight. His nose was in a hurry, and the two huge ears kept turning, and a squeaking sound from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the channel suddenly sounded and Richard slammed: "Hey!!" This is a thunderous sound, more under the influence of magic. It is magnified hundreds of times, and in the narrow caves, the echoes are superimposed and merge into an incredible sound. Even Li, who had been prepared for a long time, was shocked by the shock. The mouse demon was shaken twice like drunkenness, and a slamming sound fell from the cave wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha went straight, savagely slaughtered half of the sheath and popped the dagger. Richard counter-scratched the short sword, and a sword stabbed into the mouth of the mouse, until there was no handle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouse devil screams desperately, biting the dagger. It is a pity that the barbaric slaughter is a quasi-artifact. The material is not the mouse moth can be chewed. Richard gritted his teeth and drove the scalp and numb sound from the teeth of the mouse and the bones of the bones out of his ears. The wrists twisted and the daggers twirled hard. The exaggerated serrations on the sword front almost the mouse The throat was agitated, but the mouse was struggling for a few more minutes before it slowly moved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s forehead is all sweat, this is the first Dakso Das who he killed on the battlefield, and also made him deeply I realized the horror of Dakso Das creatures in the same plane. The devil's vitality is too tenacious, although they have no construction and no equipment, but the combat power is not weaker than the Normand strong and well-equipped and well-equipped. This is also the basis for the Nolanders to calibrate the Dakso Das. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard confirmed that the mouse demon had died, only to take a breath, and slowly pulled out the short sword. Seeing the short sword of the bone without any trace of damage, Richard is relieved. The mouse's teeth are extremely powerful, and the fine-level weapons are often able to bite off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there was no hidden second mouse around, Richard placed several magic alarm traps in the cave and began to dismember the body of the mouse. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work has been quite skilled in the work, and the barbaric slaughter is extremely sharp, far more powerful than his original knife with no attributes, so a moment Kung Fu Mouse Devil became a pile of materials. He picked out the intact teeth, wiped the blood stains with moss, and wrapped them in the leather of the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the mouse demon is a cannon-like character in the Dakosodas camp, their hiding ability is at the forefront. The mouse skin that has eliminated the blood is one of the best magic materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took a look, the blood beads attached to the dagger flew clean. He merged the short sword into the main sword of the barbaric slaughter, then stalked the long sword, wrapped the mouse skin on the back, and adjusted the state without hesitation, and then walked out of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exit is also on the cliff of the kilometer, in front of the magnificent world. The darkness of the sky is rugged, the sky covered by thick clouds, the grayish black of the distant sky and the earth, and the beautiful and dangerous time belts of light, appear in front of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a desperate world that has died. The blood-colored columns that are shot from the sky can be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath of toxin and burnt smell, and then jumped down from the hole. Every few meters he fell, he took a kick or kick on the cliff, slightly delayed the momentum, and then came to the bottom of the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
