			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly snorted and stopped the lion, to the forest on the side of the road Look around. There was a giant wolf in the middle of it, staring at the strange knight of this team with vigilance. While being watched by the giant wolf, Sinclair suddenly had a feeling of being snooped, which made her very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly jumped from the lion, wrapped her body in a cloak as usual, and disappeared in the night. The giant wolf is obviously stunned and shows wisdom that does not belong to the beast. It carefully retreated backwards, but only two steps back, Hinckler appeared quietly behind it, the double knives on the neck of the giant wolf, gently pressed, the wolf head fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s consciousness, the light spot of a wind tooth is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly stood up and walked to the window and brushed the curtains. The moonlight spread out across the lake, the night was quiet, the wind was soft, it was a beautiful night, and there was no killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair cuts off the wolf's head and flashes back to the lion on a few steps. The lion snorted in the air and trots again. The speed of its trot has been running away with the konjac. Rolling black torrents move forward again and head straight for the castle at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Sinclair stopped the lion and then pointed to the grass not far away. There was a huge wolf in it, and it was calmly watching the team. Seeing that the team stopped, it immediately turned around and ran, but at the same time a town bear knight had struggling to throw his own heavy axe. The big axe whirls in the air, making a whistling whistle, and instantly sweeping through the waist of the wind, cutting it into two segments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight drives the konjac, pulls the heavy axe on the ground, and presses the body of the fangs according to the news of Sinclair, and brings it to the lion . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These wolves are a bit strange. Baby, come, eat it, see what it knows."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lion whispered a few times and was unwilling to work. Exploring the soul is a very exhausting thing. It just took a full stomach. Exploring a soul will become hungry again. But Sinclair couldn't let it be so lazy, pressed his head down hard and slammed it a few times. The lion screamed helplessly, and looked down at the corpse of the wind tooth slowly, which was extremely reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the wind teeth is much larger than the ordinary devil wolf, but it is very slender compared to the lion. After the lion swallowed the wind tooth completely, it swayed on the ground and did not move. After a full ten minutes, it climbed up and shook his head hard, screaming languidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has no soul?!" Sinclair was very surprised. Without a soul, nature can't detect memory. But any beast should have a soul, even if the magician's contract creature also has a soul mark, only the magical summoning creature that is purely composed of energy has no soul, but there is no body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion did not find anything on the wind. There is also a possibility that the lion's ability is not enough to detect the soul of the wind, but this possibility is very low. Because even in Noland, the lion is a rare and powerful Warcraft. Spying on the soul is their ability to be talented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Cinclair did not delay the time for a soulless wolf. In a brand new stranger, it is possible to encounter anything. A giant wolf without a soul is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second head is squatted, the second spot in Richard's consciousness becomes dim and then disappears. But this time before the death of the wind, an image of the Sinclair and the bear of the town has been passed from the wind to the mother's nest and transmitted by the mother's nest to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinclair and the town bear knight!" Richard immediately realized the identity of the person in the image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opens the map and looks at it through the moonlight. If you connect the two places where the wind disappears, you can see that the line is clearly pointing to the dusk castle. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment and rang the bell in the room. The soft ringing sounded through the pipe in the distance. Soon, a maid knocked on Richard's door: "His Richard, do you have any needs?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li opened the door and said directly: "I want to see the Baron Fontaine, there is a very important thing! Immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... .... Now the Baron adults should have fallen asleep. Is there anything you can find the Baron adults tomorrow morning?" The maid said. She is also a tired face now, after all, it is already midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a very important thing!" Richard emphasized the very important modifier. Although the maid was sleepy, she was not stupid enough to go home and immediately went to the housekeeper. Whether Richard’s request, whether reasonable or important, is not a judgment of her little maid, or her right to judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The history of the Baron family is no less than that of some giants, and the long history has formed relatively strict procedures. Of course, Richard will not really wait for the maid to pass through the layers. He gave an order to Gangde in his consciousness, so the big man suddenly screamed in his own room, and the thick killing was even more tidal. Crazy out, like a raging wind swept the half of the main building! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine is a master of the 14th-level swordsmanship. He is extremely sensitive to the murderous sense, and this must be more useful than the wake-up method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, in just five minutes, the bare-handed baron appeared in front of Richard. Seeing the heavily armed Richard and the followers he gathered from the other side of the promenade, Baron Fontaine’s eyes immediately slammed, flashing a sharp light, and asked: “The enemy attack?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "The battle between the coalition forces and the invasion of the devil that occurred in the blood-stained land not long ago, should the baron adults have heard of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fang Dan nodded. This battle is the most important event of the Sequoia Kingdom since this year. The disastrous defeat of the coalition forces was almost completely annihilated. Not only did the strength of the courageous god Nei'an in the kingdom be compromised, but the two great aristocrats were wiped out. In the next period of time, the political situation of the kingdom will be turbulent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said solemnly: "One of my subordinates just sent a message through a secret way. Defeat the coalition’s devil corps head, Sinclair, with all her The reloading knight and magician have crossed the Bran village and are coming to the dusk castle at full speed! Now we have a little precious time to prepare for the defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shocking news, Baron Fontaine can hardly believe his ears: "She is attacking the Sequoia Kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "She wants to attack the entire plane," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
