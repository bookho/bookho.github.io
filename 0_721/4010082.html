			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the problem is that Iowa is too handsome and almost It is always inseparable from the flowing sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel is a young man, full of body, full of mature man's charm, his own appearance is completely overwhelming Richard, and temperament is sacred and elegant And with the special equipment of the eternal dragon temple fighting priests, it is like a sun. Richard was standing by his side, a teenager who was still a young man. Although both close and far away, Richard felt that he had a good grasp of this kid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liusha has great trust in Iowa and does not reject his approach. This made Li’s mind always look like a cross, and wanted to ask about the sand, but I didn’t know where to start. The behavior of Iowa seems to be a close-fitting escort for the sand, doing anything for her, but maintaining a strict minimum distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom limit of 10 cm? It seems to be a little closer. Li can't help thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard thought of another unexplained question: Is Iraq really a defensive escort? Who has seen the escort of the divine master is also a divine master? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal and timeless dragon has thousands of gods, but Richard has seen more than 100 kinds of districts, and he does not know what the guards of heaven are. However, if Richard knows more, I am afraid it will not be calm. The different types of combat weapons created by the Heavenly Guardian and the Brood are not only highly intelligent, but also their own souls. In addition to being loyal to the owner, there is great autonomy in other things. This is similar to the twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard’s heart, the change of Time Lighthouse has alerted the original followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just stepped out of the gate of the transfer hall and heard a thunderous voice on the head: "Head! You are finally back! Three months, no more Come back, I don't know how to fight this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bold and bold voice belongs to Gangde, he strode forward and covered himself The pace is more firm and powerful than three months ago. The giant man stared at his giant axe, but he did not know when to change a more scarlet tomahawk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big axe in Gangde’s hand is often changed, the same is the hungry heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two more small scars on the neck of Gangde’s face. This is a new injury and has not yet fully grown. But it can hurt in this place, indicating that he has never been too flat during this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard, Gangde’s eyes lit up with fire, laughing and coming, his arms showing, and he seemed to want to hug with Richard. But he immediately remembered the identity gap between the two sides, so he took back his hand, scratched his head, and smiled a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha did not have so much scruples, went straight up, first hit the chest of Gangde hard, and then gave him a wicked hug! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collision of two men, Richard almost flew out. He is a mage who comes out of dark blue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside Gangde, standing with water splashes. The girl looked at Richard with a struggle and her hands were shaking. Richard didn't think too much, and also gave her a wicked hug. In the moment when Richard was in his arms, the girl was as hard as steel, and her hand was uncontrollably extended to the handle of the perpetual guide, and she wanted to pull the knife. But after her body trembled, she suddenly became soft like water, letting Richard hold her in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard immediately let go of the splash, and then the huge ogres. This time, there is no way to hug. Tiramisu is almost three meters tall, and it is fat and staggering. Richard’s one thigh is almost the same. Compared with leaving, the tiramisu can be a lot bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard came to the front, Tiramisu said with a sigh of relief: "Head! I am thirteen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at this awkward ogres and suddenly felt that something was wrong, so he asked, "How is your head awkward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu kneels down on one knee and tries to bend down and point to his left shoulder, saying, "Look at this, head!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shoulder of Tiramisu, there is a teacup-sized sore. It is not injured, but is broken from the inside. From the sore mouth, you can see a yellowish horn. The body under the sore mouth swells into a big bag, as if something has to break out from the inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately remembered the variation of the ogre, and asked with surprise and joy: "Do you want to grow a second head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu nodded hard and said loudly: "It’s a three-point cooked, I’m sure it must be him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I believe it too!" Richard slammed his fist on the chest of Tiramisu. This is his full blow, but only the fat of Tiramisu's chest is collected. For the ogre, thick and tough skin and thick fat are their natural armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the ogres mutate, they become extremely powerful. Nolan's mage has long studied this race, and the ogre who can grow a second head is the natural king of the race. But the second head actually comes from the original soul. It is only a part of the split that will form the independent personality and wisdom of the second head. In fact, it is still tiramisu, not a three-point cooked. But of course, Richard will not say this conclusion, but only as a secret that is always buried in the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the ogre, Richard saw Sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Necromancer also enjoyed a heavy hug, although this was somewhat uncomfortable for both. The Necromancer is too dead, and anyone who feels close will feel discomfort, while Richard is filled with a lot of time and spirit. Although the power of the Eternal and Time Dragon is not a sacred attribute, its ability to annihilate death is more than the divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two mages laughed and smiled happily, even though their expressions were awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you should give me a piece of what...there is it," said Sandru. The Necromancer has a temperament, and his heart has been closed for more than 30 years. Opening something other than a corpse is actually a euphemistic way of expressing his mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately replied with a big smile: "Reassured, I have prepared a bargain for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shandru grinned, although his smile was not good at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard found that one of the followers was missing, so he asked, "What about Oral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Today it is the turn of the kid to go out to fight, so it is estimated that he will be seen at night, head!" Gangde explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard then asked a few more questions before he realized that these guys had not been idle since he left. Instead, they took turns to bring the soldiers deep into the blood-stained area, and attacked the horses and caravans on the red Cossack side. It was a few hard battles. Such continuous attacks have forced the red Cossacks to separate a large number of troops to protect the caravans, which will maintain the current stalemate. If the red Cossacks are released, I am afraid that the army has already been pressed outside the blue water oasis city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when asked about the situation, Richard looked different and asked: "Can the water spray also bring troops?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The girl snorted and her eyes turned to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde pulled Richard aside and whispered. It turned out that the first girl was playing with him, but the two people often had opposite views on the situation. Quarrels often have to be drawn to each other to draw conclusions. Since the girl has risen to the 12th level, Gangde has only one level of superiority, which is of course not the girl's opponent who is armed with dark breath. When the number of times is more than two, the two sides will part ways, and each soldier will fight according to his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde seems to be a rough man, but he can live from the death camp. He is very embarrassed. He used to know how to take the war. He worked hard and proved that he was a natural general in actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever didn’t think that the Shuihua Band was actually very good, her keen instinct often gave insight into the enemy’s weaknesses, and she was best at forbearing and Patience, often waiting until the prey is the most relaxed, will suddenly burst, giving the enemy a weak and critical strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrific means of direct attack on the key, Richard has personally experienced it. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oral is the favorite to pick the weak enemy, and then rely on the superiority of his elf war songs, relying on the number of troops to pile up the enemy. As for Clark, he was originally a soldier. In the end, it was Sandron’s turn. Everyone knows that the Necromancer is an army himself, and giving him an army is even more terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色 is the most special, she almost lost every battle. No matter who led the team, she just mixed in and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the color?" When she talked about her, Richard remembered that there was such a special unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you think of it, the twilight appears in Richard’s perception. After all, she is the creation of the mother's nest, through the mother's nest and Richard has a soul connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard immediately noticed that the twilight had entered a state of concealment, and that the knights and freedom fighters who were behind Lee’s body apparently stared at some aims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Richard shouted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His screaming is very timely, because the twilight has already swelled from the hidden state, appearing behind a stepping knight, the left hand blade is going to him After the heart pierced, the knife tip has easily cut the armor on his body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annihilation stops instantly, and the twilight immediately sends a message in consciousness: "Master, he wants to kill you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, nothing. Let him go." Richard replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Steps are pale and a little weak. He looked at the twilight that suddenly appeared, and his eyes were full of shock and fear. He is Elvin, Richard’s punishment is not to say, but to bring him to the Faro plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
