			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning two days later, Richard’s team left the Bloodstone Camp , rushed to the blue water oasis by the coolness that had not been dispersed in the morning. It is also an oasis closest to the fringe area of ​​the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving, Richard’s team had dozens of horses, several carriages, and thirty half-orc warriors. The extra half-orc warrior is the price of Richard and the Thunder hammer, and it is also the price of the scrolling magic scroll. The unexpected progress in the relationship with the Bloodstone tribe also changed Richard’s view of the half-orc warriors. He decided to bring the soldiers and treat them as core combat units instead of being used as cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the big men Sam and Mark’s original men, they were kept in the bloodstone camp by Richard, managing the springs for him, and all related business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving, Richard only said a word to Sam, "I have always given my greatest trust."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloodstone Camp is approximately 80 kilometers from the Blue Water Oasis. This seemingly short journey is very dangerous. Many caravans regard the Blue Water Oasis as an important supply and transfer station. With a lot of caravans, it naturally attracts all the thieves and horses. Moreover, the team of many large slave traders will not mind temporary guest robbers or murderers when the time is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of Richard is of a moderate size. Although there are several carriages, it is obviously carrying baggage, not a truck. In the eyes of professional thieves, oil and water are not enough. Moreover, the composition of this team is very strange. The two armed ogres, the 30 strong half-orc warriors, and the dozens of followers who follow the team, let the team bring a rich tribal color. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many tribal races believe in ancestor worship, but also have a deep concept of blood hatred. Once they are enemies with them, they are often endless for several generations. Therefore, thieves who live in bloody places all year round are not willing to provoke tribal orcs, unless they are sure to destroy their entire tribe. But there is no advantage in doing this. The orcs who live in tribes are still in a relatively primitive stage, and the adult orcs are all warriors. Killing a small tribe has to pay a lot of money, but it can hardly get any benefit. There are so many businesses that are not profitable, and few people actually do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half-orc tribe in the Bloodstone Camp is an exception. They have appeared in the Sanctuary for several generations, so they firmly control the bloodstone. The camp is a transportation hub. Although the thunder hammer generation did not produce the sanctuary, but the number of half-orc warriors has increased greatly than the previous generation, and the blood stone tribe pursues limited openness and order, does not completely exclude the position of foreign strongmen in the camp. So there are the appearances of Hoven, Huli and others. Because of this, once the bloodstone camp is out of the enemy, they will also be a powerful boost. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the wealth accumulated in the bloodstone tribe for more than a century has already entered Richard’s pocket, and most of it has turned into a dark breath on the water. Richard's remaining magic material is only enough for two configurations, and there are very serious restrictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riding in the battle, Richard squinted and looked around the stone forest and red land of the blood-stained land, the sun projected without any cover, and it rose The heat often distort the scenery in the distance. It is in such a bad land that the various intelligent races are living stubbornly and living very well. Because no one knows if tomorrow will die, so what can be done today will become very crazy. Bloodthirsty, killing, females, slaves, and drugs, all sin that can be imagined can be found in this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
