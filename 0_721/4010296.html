Richard tried to move his left hand and felt that he was free to move. He was pleasantly surprised, and this reminded me of the egg of the Hydra lizard that was eaten by him in the mountains and the sea. Hydra is known for its resilience, and it seems that most of its physical recovery is inherited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the left arm is moving, Richard is not ready to hide any more, not to mention that hunger feels so powerful that he can’t stay longer. Can no longer find food, Richard feels that he may be hungry at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Richard’s luck is still not very good. He did not go out for a few hundred kilometers and encountered a three-handed Wolf of Dakosodas. This is a very similar creature to the Abyss three-headed dog. It is said to be a species derived from the blood of the purgatory three-headed dog. It is awkward, greedy, and human beings are supremely delicious. So when I saw Richard, it was green in all nine eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard’s eyes are also green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hei did not hesitate to start the sacrifice, the fate of the twins, a thick bloody lightning that descended from the sky, one of the three wolves was smashed . Then Richard pulled out the elf knife and pulled out a residual image, rushing to the three wolves that were hit hard, and twisting the remaining two wolves into a bloody fog! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard’s feeling of hunger finally faded. He wiped the blood from his mouth and looked at the three wolves that had only skeletons and wolf skins. This reminds me that the three wolves are strictly intelligent lives, and their wisdom is no worse than humans. In the Dakosodas plane, the identity of the three wolves is a warrior, not a Warcraft, not a beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the field of extinction, there is no endless relationship, no mercy and kindness. Humans are also delicious food in the eyes of all Daksodas races. Only in the days of the sun, the Sanctuary can eat the food from Noland. When it comes to the land of extinction, the most popular dry food is the dried mouse meat made of black crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will take up the wolf skin, and the skeleton will be thrown on the wasteland and continue to move toward the sun. This time his physical strength is surprisingly good, his left arm is itch, and the injury is recovering at a speed that can be felt. The flesh and blood of the three wolves contain rich energy and are the best recovery and healing drugs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Richard has experienced several hard battles. When he killed a strong opponent, he was also killed and fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when the day is not far away, Richard is running all the way, the speed has been raised to the fastest, and even the power of the magical armed forces! Behind him, more than ten mouse devils landed on the limbs, just like flying. This is by no means the amount that Richard can deal with, or three Richards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He simply ran straight toward the sun, and fired a fire magic into the sky, whether or not he used it, to ask the city guards for help. Originally it should be fireball, flying to a certain height and bursting into numerous fireworks. This is the simple flower shape that Noond asked for help in the white night, whether it is magic or vindictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the side of Richard, suddenly there was a vague figure, this is a burly middle-aged man. Looking at the figure that Richard was rushing to, he snorted and snorted: "The coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after looking at Richard again, he snorted: "The little master of the 16th grade, it is not easy to come alone alone. Well, a little meaning, just help you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of a middle-aged man becomes clear, stepping across one step, moving a hundred meters in an instant, and stopping in front of more than a dozen madly chasing the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rushing Richard suddenly noticed the strange silence behind him, and the screams of the mouse and the scream did not know when it completely disappeared, and the blood was very strong. But it’s coming. He slowed down a bit and looked back, but he stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the distance, more than a dozen mouse demons have become corpses and scattered all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard looked around, but only saw the scarred open space, not even a half-personal. Richard opened his mouth and knew that someone had helped himself in the dark, but he didn't know who the man was. Since the other party does not show up, it is because you don't want to let yourself know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard gave up the effort to find the man and continued to rush to the sun. Although it is now possible to clearly see the magnificent capital of the day, this is because the field of vision is exceptionally far away. It takes half a day to get to the gates of the city that never falls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard really stood in front of the giant gate of the sun, he could hardly believe that he really came here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the world full of despair, madness, killing and death behind him, feeling like a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An axe gun suddenly ran in front of Richard, the guard of the day and night, looked up and down Richard, lazily said: "嗨Little guy, where did you come from, what about your grown-ups? What's with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, the face is now A faint murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is not a general city, its defense is directed at the Dakso Das, the Nolanders are free to enter and leave, and they are not listening. Said to check the carry items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard in front of him is clearly looking for cockroaches, and Richard’s keen perception has found that the guard’s gaze swept over his own back pack, occasionally revealing A greedy gaze that is not easy to detect, the purpose of the other party is coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of going through the dead wilderness alone in the past ten days has made Richard always on the verge of breaking out, and the murder has reached a peak. Under such provocations, I almost couldn’t help but glance at the fierce momentum of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze of Richard made the guard extremely uncomfortable. His face was black and he vomited heavily on the floor and said: "The hair is not long." Kid, look what! Look, go with me to the other side, I suspect that you are a spy of the Dax Sodas, need to search!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Richard’s murder disappeared and replaced with a faint glow in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard suddenly felt that the whole body was extremely uncomfortable, as if he had been stared at it, the cold sweat instantly came out! He immediately looked around, but did not see the enemy, and the companions around him seemed to have no movement, so he was even more alarmed. The danger that you can't see is the most terrible. Those who can stand on the ground in the field have a very keen instinct for danger, and now the strong sense of guarding the danger has reached the point of threatening life! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the original guards on the other side of the wall, did not move or talk, and the middle-aged guard who even turned his head away when Richard and the guards were opposite each other suddenly moved and walked over. He stood by his companion, but his position just cut off the eyes of the two. The middle-aged guards were much more relaxed in their tone or look. They said to Richard: "Are you a white night adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." I nodded and the eyes that spurted the light stared at the middle-aged guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat of the noon guard also has the same instant humidity, but his obvious experience is much richer than the other guards. He hurriedly said to Richard: "You must be Li We are not malicious, just the duty. The White Nights are now in the city, you can find her in the Lawrence store."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The middle-aged guard pulled the companion hard and opened the way to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original sly guard is now very ugly, a look of sorrow. However, knowing that Richard’s ‘adult’ is white night, he obviously has the courage to dare to say more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is not in a hurry to enter the sun, but to the former guard, Sen Ran: "If you have the ability, you will take off this body." System armor, tell me the words just now! If you can live for a minute under my little boy who is not long, I will follow your last name!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard's face instantly swelled into a purple-red, but the mouth was closed several times, but finally failed to say a few words. The middle-aged guard hurriedly stopped in front of Richard and laughed with a smile: "Li Cha, the white night adult has been waiting for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted , faintly said: "Don't have another time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Must! Certainly!" The attitude of the middle-aged guard is more moderate, and even smashed. This is a noble etiquette, although it is a bit funny to be armed at this time, and the guards covered with shackles are a bit funny, but in the face of such a humble attitude, it is impossible for Richard to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Richard didn’t mind even killing him. When the previous guard was in trouble, the middle-aged guards did not see it at all. These two guys were obviously a group of people, ready to exploit the newcomers who had just arrived in the absolute battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Richard’s departure, the middle-aged guard sighed and began to sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous guards then dared to whisper and cursed: "A little guy of the 16th grade, also his/mother/so arrogant! Laozi is holy The strong domain, is not to guard the gate here? If it is not in the face of the white night, I will not kill him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged guard said with a smile "If you say this, don't say it in the future. It's all abnormal when you can walk with the white nights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't believe it, The 16th-level guy can beat me!" The guard is still not convinced. The middle-aged guard sighed and felt that the guards made sense, but somehow, there was always a feeling of uneasiness in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard is following the road of the outer city all the way up, once again shocked by the grand end of the day, the land has long been small Not happy to leave behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Richard, the two ordinary sanctuaries without legendary equipment are no more difficult to deal with than the two Encore people. In particular, the guard at the beginning was obviously not promoted to the Sanctuary soon. Such a guy, Richard’s eight-level lightning, which was sacrificed and destroyed, was directly killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
