			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of strength is not as good as your own construction knight, that sanctuary strong When the corner of the eye jumped, there was a trace of fear. When he thought about it, he immediately shouted: "You, Archimonde, want to make the blue moon the same as it is, and it is the enemy of all the aristocrats of fascism. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer of the knight is to raise the arrogance directly, and he is ready to ride the charge, but at this time, he is suddenly pulled Then, the knight turned around and saw that he was Richard. He quickly called out the adult of Richard, and his expression was extremely unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard pulled the knight, and then personally rode forward and walked toward the Sanctuary, the Sanctuary’s pupil shrinking, forehead Suddenly there was a cold sweat. He just wanted to say something. He suddenly heard a bang, but he saw that Richard was extinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute." Dahan was busy yelling, but Richard has jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just fallen from the magic ride and has fallen sharply. The trajectory is completely contrary to common sense. In an instant, he has stood in front of the sanctuary and extinct the blade. It is a knife that ignites a blue fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife is almost beyond imagination, and the blue-bladed blade has some illusory feelings, and the scimitar that has passed through the erect block of the big man without any hindrance And the arm, swept over the neck, and then into the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked a flash and returned to the magic ride, as if he had not moved, but the sanctuary in front of him suddenly A high head flew up, far away to the entrance of the hall, the tumbling head, you can see his incredible expression at the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People breathe for a moment, a sanctuary, a strong person close to the heavens, just died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headless body of the Sanctuary is still not falling, but the machete and an arm in front of him suddenly broke and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"District Sanctuary, also dare to pull my road to Archimonde." Until Richard screamed like a thunder, people just woke up like a dream, have a lot Frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there were more than a dozen sacred fields in the field, but the very strong big man was killed by Richard, they couldn’t help but be at risk. Anyone would be afraid to become the second object of Richard’s second test, and a few more insights. At this time, the Sanctuary remembered Richard’s record on the field of extinction. It seems that when Richard was not a great magister, he was already murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the door of the main hall and said: "Go to the Eternal Dragon Hall, who dares to stop the road, kill it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of knights at the same time to break the drink should be ordered, the giant sword in hand, murderous, instantly turned into an attack formation, surrounded by Richard to go outside the temple, some knights in the hands of the sword With shocking blood, it shows that the sentence is not empty talk, and that Richard chose a straight line, and did not mean to bypass the people who blocked the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people want to yell "You really dare to be enemies with all nobles." But when you see that the sacred body on the ground has not cooled, put This sentence swallowed back, and some people have hard bones in the body, but they are stuck in the middle of the road, but when the iron shovel sword really comes, it is not really willing to die in vain, but has to let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse of the still-blooded Sanctuary on the ground, ruthlessly shows Richard’s determination, even if the entire aristocratic ukiyod wants to grab the blue Month, he didn't care about the bloody wash of fauna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of costume knights swayed from the fascinating world and went straight to the eternal dragon temple. On the road, watching this team of people not only have nobles, but also warriors. There is a sanctuary, and there is even more than one legendary strongman. However, until Richard entered the Eternal Dragon Hall, no one stood up to fight for the blue moon. The murderousness on Richard’s face was not a fake, and the knights were built. The murderousness is not a sham, and the aristocrats see the background of Richard. The warriors saw the great swords of the knights. The sacred strongmen thought of Richard’s arrogance and arrogance. It is the individual tracking spear at the hands of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard went into the Eternal Dragon Hall all the way, and the three knights behind him also held a demon with the sacrifices. box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top floor of the Masters Association, Thor stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and watched Richard enter the Eternal Dragon Hall. This shook his head, I don’t know if it’s praise or sigh. Said: "This little guy, murder is really heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to an old-aged old mage coughed a few times before saying: "Is it right? Really let him take the blue moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor touched his beard, and some inscrutablely said: "Maybe this thing belongs to him, this is, fate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Master smiled a bit Said: "I know now that most of the things are not mine, but that is the artifact of the soul..." When he said it, his tone was still full of disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor's heart has the same feeling, and also sighs heavily, that is, as a legendary mage, want to get a soulful artifact, but also rely on the fate of fate Only when I heard that the old Master was coughing again, Thor asked with concern: "It doesn't matter if you hurt, how can you cough so badly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Master sighs Road: "My legendary magic was broken by the blue moon, some months of force invaded my body, the moon of the blue moon is biased to destruction, it is really amazing! Until now, how to clear it, I still have a clue None."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor was very surprised and said: "Lushen Ai Lucia is now just near the middle of the power, but you are exploring the depths of the plane. For many years, how can we not clean up the power of a little string moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master is still a bitter smile: "I used to think so, but now I am entering the body. I realized that it was not the case at all. It’s strange to think about it now. How can A Lucia have only medium power? Only by a blue moon, she is able to get a powerful power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor asked with concern: "Is it important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Master shook his head and said, "Nothing, it’s estimated that it will take some time, hehe, until now, I don’t know what the blue moon is. It would be so powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the old Master looked, and Thor’s face smiled and said coldly: "Since come Now, come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remote door opens and a middle-aged man in a dark tuxedo appears, exactly and Li The man who was confronted outside the floating island, he had already opened the door first, but knocked the door deliberately. The smile on his face was elegant but false. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor's pupils shrank and said coldly: "The turbidity, you are the opposite of the dragon of eternal and time, actually dare to appear here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man named Turbidity touched the neatly trimmed moustache and smiled: "Since I am back, Thor, you should understand what it means, do you have to say it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor’s face changed slightly, and the old master quietly exchanged a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity helps the robes, and the exaggerated aristocratic step through the entire open space, swaying to Thor and the old Master, full of a look of wine Then he did not know where to find a cigar, ignited a flame, and took a deep breath, then spit out a cloud of smoke, snoring and laughing a few times, said: "Six-six No. Floating Island is now a family. I don’t mind if I kill them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor said seriously: “For an unidentified use of blue In the month, you will set up a big enemy out of thin air, and the behavior of attacking the floating island giants is extremely bad. This precedent can never be opened. First of all, I don’t think about it when I am this.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity reveals a sinister smile, and violently puts his hand on Thor’s shoulder, close to his ear, and said in a hoarse voice: “The monthly force of the blue moon is What nature, you must be clearer than me, old things, I am not doing this for myself, but for... That one, do you really want to stop me, but I want to be clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor’s eyes flashed a glimmer of light and asked quietly: "Which One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbid stream laughs silently, revealing a white-hearted tooth that gently vomits a name: "Of course... nothing "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tor's eyes slammed round and lost his voice: "His Royal Princess, why should she come back."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity straightened up the body, took a deep sip of cigars, and then leisurely said: "Why can't you come back," I said already, anyway, Thor, you understand now, this The thing is not that you can intervene, just when nothing happens, isn't it good, don't forget, you should focus on the interests of the entire royal family. You see, I told you such important news, is it right? Take out some of your good bottles and ask for a drink. Ok, if you don't talk, I should agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp; Tol calmed his face and called two young female mage apprentices, and told them that after a while they had a tray back, and placed three cups of different colors on each tray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
