			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a flash of shadow, and the white peacock of Theo. Yang’s god suddenly fell to the earth, and then the Great Elf King was brought to the hand. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no shortage of battles between the strong and the dead, the heroes of the Olympics are so simple and straightforward that they are beyond all high elves. Imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Druid said slowly: "You can't underestimate the power of Richard, you can beat Theo so easily, I think he already has a super strong The strength of us. There are not many people who can fight with him. Now, only the Royal Highness of the Holy Elves can be dispatched. If I play, I won’t have a good grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Great Elf King excitedly proposed: "We should mobilize the army to intercept! Can not let him go deep into the hinterland of the empire. The dirty steps of mankind will stain our holy grass and forest." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are we intercepting? Don't forget that His Royal Highness has assembled 20,000 elite warriors in the quiet forest, and the results have been defeated by Richard. The rush to send troops will only incur Failed!" said another big elf king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Great Sacrifice of the Moon Temple gently slammed the staff and suddenly silenced the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sacrifice said: "I heard that Richard brought seven warships, each of which corresponds to a different crescent moon..... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great elf king in charge of the intelligence replied: "It is true, big sacrifice. And according to the news from the Druids, the warships are not in their possession." Tables, in some of their attacks, do attach different monthly power attributes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard that the troops he brought were elves Lord, is an elf tribe we have never seen before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big elf king nodded: "Yes. Those elves are more than us." The lower descendants of Noland are much larger. The combat power is far stronger than them. In fact, from the five thousand elves in the Richards, the lowest level is 16 and more than two thousand. The name reached level 17. I think these elves are probably a branch of our royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Including the Elf Emperor, all the high elves in the hall nodded and recognized this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of this elf force has surpassed the emperor’s most famous moonblade. Although the Moon Blade Guard is also based on the 17th level, but the total number is less than 100, and the huge number of Richards as many as 2,000 is completely incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful and elf. In the eyes of a high-ranking elf, it should naturally be a branch of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard or Goshawk is here, it will naturally be deeply impressed by the conceit of these higher elves. As long as it is a powerful elf, it must be related to the royal family. This kind of thinking does not know how they came up with it. But from the emperor to the Saint Druid, and then to the Great Sacrifice, everyone in the hall is deeply impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of the Moon Temple nodded and said: "This is correct. So I think that this investigation is likely to be related to His Royal Highness, who suddenly disappeared seven hundred years ago. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Heart!" There was a low exclamation on the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight hundred years ago, the name of the night wind. Sparks was widely known, and the prestige in the elf empire was even above the emperor at the time. He is a genius swordsman, a genius shooter, a genius Druid and a genius mage. Even he was recognized by Luna, Alusia, and received three talents in the enlightenment ceremony. This made him become the sacrifice of the Temple of the Moon at the same time, and the strength of the power gained was not worse than the great sacrifice at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enlightenment ceremony of Luna is held every year. Only the most important and most talented elves of the younger generation will get the opportunity to enlighten. Less than a third of the elves who received talent in the ceremony. The night wind. The Spark can get three talents in one fell swoop. It is completely unprecedented. After that, there is no one who immediately shakes the entire elf empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the night wind. The performance of Sparks perfectly matches his talent, rewriting many definitions of genius on the mainland. Even looking at the era of the Noland Elven Empire, he is one of the most dazzling geniuses in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter in foreign battles, plane exploration, or magic research, the night wind. Sparks has left a series of dazzling achievements. It is said that he is most grateful to the Luna, but it is the unique talent of wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the night wind. Star language, there were few elves who could see this talent in the enlightenment ceremony. There is no one to choose this talent. After the Spark, the talent of wisdom has received unprecedented attention, although it does not directly enhance the combat power. However, since then, no wisdom talent has ever appeared in all enlightenment rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why, the night wind. The Spark suddenly became crazy and fell in love with the power of the abyss. He went to the abyss several times and dealt with the lords of all sizes. Inside his tower is a wandering demon everywhere, and even in a tribal clash, he directly drives a team of demons to level the opponent's village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night Wind. The practice of Spark has already committed the taboo of the Elven Empire, but at that time he was already the King of the Great Elf, and he was the king of the Great Elf. The first one. No one wants to go to the night wind on the site to crusade him, so this matter is put on hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, shortly afterwards, the world tree inhabited by the night wind was polluted by demonic forces and withered. This finally provoked the anger of Wang Ting's golden world tree. Wang Ting sent all the powerful who could gather, and went to crusade against the night wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived under the tower of the night wind, they found that the lava was filled with sulphur and it was already part of the abyss. The interior of the tower has been empty, and the night wind. Star language is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the crusade was preparing to retreat, an abyss lord suddenly rushed out of the tower of the night wind! The powerful men of Wang Ting paid a very heavy price before they finally sealed the big lord, but there was no way to destroy it and had to throw it back into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the night wind. Star language has never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the incident, what kind of speculation is there, and even some people speculate that the abyss lord is the night wind. Such a nonsense statement is of course taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passage of time, the night wind. Star language is gradually forgotten by the high elves. All his records were also destroyed, and only the high elves of the Great Elf King level were allowed to access the only record kept in the small library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha suddenly appeared, and with the team’s strong, unclear elves, and also the use of the moon, it’s really possible Night wind. Star language has a relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Emperor then asked: "Who can tell me, what is the origin of this Richard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sentence, it was asked to fall down all the present. High elf. No one knows Richard's past, nor does he know how strong he is. The elf empire of the green continent is actually very closed, and it does not pay attention to what happened on Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange between the two continents is extremely limited. The Elf King Court will only update the continent of Noland every few years or even ten years. The change of the strong and the political map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong only detailed to the level of the super strong, as the legendary information is much more omission. Under the legend, even the heavenly sanctuary, the high elves have no interest in knowing their whereabouts, background and abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rhythm of the high elves, Richard’s rise is so fast that until now Elf Wang Ting did not know that there were more in Noland. A new holy constructor. As for the legend of the gods, they will not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the elves of Wang Ting know, they will not take this seriously. In the eyes of the higher elves, only the magic lines passed down from the Age of Elven Empire are the most powerful and most useful. The structures that were later developed by humans and other races were all lame in power. How could it compare with the masters of the Age of Elves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you carefully study the history of the installation, the source is indeed the magic pattern from the period of the Elf Empire. Until now, there are people who are used to calling the structure a magical structure. But the magic pattern is only the most primitive and oldest form of decoration. To say the effect, the generations of human sacred sects have been constantly innovating, and the magic lines of the Elven Empire have long been left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are common sense that every builder knows, but Wang Ting’s high elves don’t know. Even if they know it, they will not admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Wang Ting’s high elves finally realized the problem. Richard came to the door, killed one of the three main fleets, killed a big elf king, and occupied a quiet forest with world trees, but they did not even know whether Richard was a warrior or a mage. ! That blurry battle image could not be analyzed at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
