			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon haha ​​smiled and said, "Do you think that a treated leather bag can hide the core black liquor? Honestly tell you that there is a core black liquor. The surrounding rules will be affected. So it is useless to put a few layers of leather bags! Come and kill this kid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were seven or eight members of the Simon's Guards in the hall, and they immediately rushed up, and the swords and swords came out. Obviously, they would kill Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a ring of bicolor light suddenly shining in the hall, passing through the body of all the guards. Richard did not pay any attention to the people who still fluttered, and went to Simon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simon’s eyes jumped, staring at the moonlight in the hands of Richard, slowly lifting the giant axe next to the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, all the members of the Guards fell behind Richard, and they never moved again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood still and looked at Simon and said, "You have made a mistake. That is, in this city, the real strong is me, and Not you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, and Richard has jumped to Simon's face, and the moonlight slams into his throat like a mist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon is arrogant, and the axe dances like a squally shower to Richard! Both of them have a lot of movements, and it is clear that the control of the twisting rules has reached a very high level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men fought for a whole minute, Simon suddenly yelled, the giant axe flew out, and he himself was stiff and staring at Richard. The face is ugly. At this moment, the moonlight has already been on the throat of Simon. With a single stroke, you can make this former superpower stand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to see the fire of time." Richard said faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon couldn’t refuse, and walked underground with Richard. In the two stone rooms, Richard did see two fires of different sizes. One of the pots is obviously ancient, and I don’t know how many years have been burned. The other pot is a bit faint, and it has some sinister and bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of the faint fire of time, Richard passed a chill in his eyes and turned to Simon and said, "Are you the fire of time that was fed by the soul of the living?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon has no shame, saying: "They should have died! The weak have no meaning in this city, they are just used as food for the reserve. Their souls are also lang fees. It’s better to give me the fuel of the fire of the time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “When you first arrived in the dark area, it was also weak.” Richard said faintly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am strong now, this is enough! And in addition to using the fire of the soul of the living as a fire, you can tell me the first Two ways to ignite the fire of time?" Simon sneered and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is silent. In addition to the fires that the oracles can master, the way Simon finds may be the only viable way, although this method is too cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon seems to see Richard’s hesitation, and goes further: “Those people are going to die! I just let them die soon. But I ignited. The second pot of time fire has quadrupled the entire city! How many people have given them a chance to survive? What about you? You taught me here, but what have you done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed in a faint sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the darkness of the world, right and wrong, black and white, so empty and weak in this extremely tough and distorted world. Perhaps like the sky here, gray is the eternal theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Richard said: "After the fire of time, there is no need for more souls, and Soulwood can keep it." I have taken away the soul that has not yet dissipated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon suddenly felt a sudden chill around, but did not know what happened. Although his perception is powerful, he can't see hundreds of souls lighted up toward Richard and integrated into Richard's soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Richard has left the city, along the established road, to the dawn. In the city, Simon is a bit embarrassed. He did not expect that Richard not only did not kill him, nor did he stay in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon is very difficult to understand. In his view, the wilderness is a place to go to hell. Only when you stay in the city can you have some enjoyment and a little life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Richard is going in the middle of the wilderness. He left Simon because even if he killed Simon, there would be another Simon in the city, which would not help. In addition, Simon has a strong battle, and Richard estimates that he has the potential to defeat a butcher. Although the probability is not large, once the butcher appears around the city, even into the order of light curtain, only Simon can block one or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grey days of the wilderness, the hard and cracked earth, the twisted soul wood, these scenes appear repeatedly, as if there is never an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark areas are vast, and Richard has some to remember how long he has gone. But he also knows that time is meaningless in dark areas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard has successfully defined the flow rate of time, it is only used to help him confirm his time in the dark area. He does not know the relationship between the time flow rate and the place in the kingdom of Eternal and Time Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long journey is not boring, and Richard has been quietly interpreting the rules of the dark regions. The reason why he wants to visit Simon's time is because in a city, the fire around time is always the place with the most souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the addition of the souls of thousands of strong people, Richard's analysis of the distortion rules has greatly accelerated. The rules are constantly being solved and become part of the power of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one day, when Richard suddenly felt that he had passed through an invisible energy curtain, he knew that he had finally left the field of dusk and came to the dawn. Ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of Richard’s progress is not slow. According to Noland’s standard, Richard can walk out thousands of kilometers a day. Many days later, Richard was almost close to a vast area that spanned nearly 100,000 kilometers before he finally left the dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard is awakened from the world of distorted rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distortion rules of all perceptual classes have been fully resolved, and the twisting rules for the dark regions themselves have been parsed out of fifteen, leaving only the last one. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extra difficulty, Richard has spent hundreds of days and nights on it, but there is still a short way to go from the final analysis. Maybe Richard will be able to realize the next moment, and it may take a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a feeling that Richard has a feeling that when all the twisting rules are resolved, the dark areas will most likely appear in their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, it is difficult for Richard to describe what kind of world the dark region is. This is not an independent plane, nor a supercontinent connected together. Even the whole picture of the whole world is what it is seen, and Richard is hard to determine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the kingdom of eternal and timeless dragons, the void is vast, and each plane is the star that adorns the night sky. At that time, the light was an eternal vortex, and the soul of Richard was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond the kingdom of eternal and timeless dragons, they are dark areas. If the dark area is really just a continent, how big is it to be able to enclose a vast void? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While thinking about it, Richard entered the dawning place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the dawning land from the dusk, Richard immediately felt that the whole world had changed. The dawning ground is brighter, and the sky is no longer a constant gray, but a gray with deep and shallow, and constantly changing. At first glance, it is like a cloud of clouds flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain on the wasteland has also been ups and downs, the number of soul wood is significantly more than the area of ​​the dusk, on a small hill, Richard even saw a soul Wood made up of wood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earth, occasionally seeing a flash of things. Those who are indifferent to the dark areas, not only have butchers, but also many things that Richard has not seen or called. If it is not that Richard’s perception is completely unaffected by the distortion rules, they cannot be seen at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, compared to the dusk, this is a vibrant land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, along the way, when seeing the aborigines in the dark areas, Richard always has an inexplicable feeling. It seems that these aborigines escaped from Zhang Huang. However, their actions are extremely secret, and they don't know what method they can use to know the arrival of Richard, so every time they are far away, they will be scattered, so that Richard wants to observe it at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
