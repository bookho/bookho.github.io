			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of Richard is almost completely defensive, with many Su The negative magic that Helen gave was that a young dragon could kill him. It was no difference between a dragon or a red dragon. Richard struggled to stand up, but the body did not listen to his own command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng’s muffled sound, the legendary mage has fallen by Richard, and the dragons in the air roared: “What do you want to do, find death?” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon group suddenly had a chaotic commotion, and wisdom surpassed humans. They are also bursting at the moment. It is clear that Su Hailun is ordering them to bite in the dead, how can they blink in the blink of an eye? The situation has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the legendary mage never had the patience to see the dragons flying in the air, and immediately became a stun in her eyes, and very disobedient . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s face sinks, and the entire magical experiment field immediately falls into the harsh winter. She sighs coldly: “Give me a roll.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s voice is cold and deep, as if from ancient times, with the last scrolling, there are actually several gods flying out of her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons in the air suddenly burst into distortions, and the dragons panicked, but the body inevitably became distorted and then disappeared one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break eviction, this is a level that can go from level 5 to legendary magic, has a very powerful damage to summoning creatures, and may even directly summon creatures Expelled from the plane, but this magic was used by Su Helun, but the power was beyond imagination, and the entire summoning dragon group was directly blasted out of Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still two black dragons in the air, which are particularly unsightly in the empty sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master’s blonde suddenly flew, and the eyes turned into a light blue cross star shape, and said coldly to the two black dragons in the air: "You think Show me your superior magic resistance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adjective of excellence has been deliberately exalted by the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black dragons were shocked, and they fluttered far and wide, and yelled in the dragon language: "Great and beautiful under the Highness, we are not summoning creatures, but slaves living in your dragon country."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s glimpse, thinking about it with his finger on the forehead, only remembered that there really is such a thing, but it’s easy to summon them, but it’s more expensive to send them back. Hands and feet, at least to spend a time to outline a magic door, and this magic door can not freely write. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has no patience at all, and her face is cold and angry: "How can I not say it earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two adult black dragons have no arguments at all. Su Hailun’s magic is like a squally shower, but there is a chance to talk to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun read a few short magical spells, pointing to the two black dragons in the distance, the black dragon screamed, the body quickly shrunk, and they claimed to be close to magic immunity, It turned out to be two goblins in the air, two goblins falling from the sky, and waiting for them underneath were the surging earth and stones, directly burying the two unlucky dragons into the depths of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black dragons certainly don’t die like this, but they are only a little bit sad, but they have made up their minds, even if the magic effect is over, there is no Su Helun The licenses, they will never climb out of the ground, so as not to see something that should not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragons have a long life and they are very gossip when they are doing nothing. The rumors about Su Helun and Richard have been quietly spread in the dragon. This is The only little secret that was not discovered by the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the legendary Master, the magical experimental field was quiet, and she hurriedly leaned over to check Richard’s injury. Just now Richard’s assault was too strong, and it was strong. To the point where she felt dangerous, the sudden terrorist attack made Su Hailun subconsciously counterattack, but she immediately attacked, even Tiamat could not bear it, not to mention the broken armor. Cracked Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was on the ground, coughing constantly, bleeding in his nose and nose, watching this scene, Su Hailun did not know why, suddenly his hands and feet were cold, There is a gap in consciousness, and I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, suddenly there was a strong vitality, centered on Richard’s body, green spread rapidly, and countless young green leaves were drilled from the ground. Desperately growing, the white flowers of the stars bloom everywhere, and the breath of Richard is also enhanced. In the blink of an eye, it is restored to near normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard sat up, wiped the blood stains on his lips, and said with a smile: "Your hand is still so heavy, almost can't climb up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen snorted, still staring at Richard, her blank consciousness completely did not reflect what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am already a holy constructor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five days later, it was my assembly conference, and I prepared two five-stage configurations this time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to take a hard road, but I have to do this"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha no longer said more, suddenly clinging to the dumb legendary Master, kissed hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun suddenly opened his eyes, as if he woke up from his dreams and exclaimed: "What are you doing?" The words behind him were stressed by Richard. Blocked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the legendary mage was pressed down on the ground. This was the first time she was so passive in her life, but she seemed to suddenly return to zero, but only A look of surprise and stunned look at Richard, until Richard slammed into her body, the legendary mage spit out a deep breath in the throat, such as waking up from a dream, raised his hands and put it down, then lifted it up and put it down, If it is repeated, I don’t know how many times, I am surrounded by Richard’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the magical experiment field gradually turned from warm to blazing, and the legendary mage gradually showed up in the nature of happiness, and gradually took more initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is already trying his best, even desperately, but his limit is still far from the expectations of the legendary mage, when the initial horror Su Hailun, who was so affectionate, changed back to the legendary mage who was arrogant and detached. She suddenly turned over and pressed Li to the bottom, and then began the process of chasing the ultimate happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that it hurts Richard, he is repeatedly crushed and eventually becomes slag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how long it took, the legendary mage finally sighed with satisfaction, the body became soft and fell on Richard, and Richard finally moved, but now there is not much effort to do more vigorous activities, he reached out and touched Su Hailun The blonde suddenly lifted her face and gently tapped her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage was sluggish and thought for a long time before he asked: "What does this mean, it is love."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is thinking about it, after a while, said: "I can't tell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am too far away from you, even now, I am only seeing you far away. In fact, I still don't understand it until now. When nothing is wrong, why would you choose me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary mage did not think, said: "One is what I like, one is fate, Libra tells me "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fate Libra, you believe it." This reason makes Richard feel incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary Master put his elbows on Richard’s chest and held his chin, saying, “Fate Libra is always following my artifact. I usually put it in time. In the torrent, it absorbs energy by itself. It takes only a few years to use it. It has the mysterious power to guide fate. Intuition tells me that there is nothing wrong with doing it in the direction indicated by it. The two recent opportunities are used. It’s on you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then a few times before." Richard was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fate of the scales has a very strong rule power, so strong that the seventh-order wisdom talent can not begin to analyze the degree, with Richard's current knowledge, know Such artifacts are not owned by Nolande at all, because its rule level is beyond the scope of Noland's world rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen thinks sideways, as if he doesn’t remember much, in fact, the legendary mage can remember anything he wants to remember, just she is now Extraordinary lazy, completely do not want to brain, just want to find a place to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time, she said: "It rarely gives a foresight, the earliest one is let me build dark blue, and the other one tells me that I can put more Some debts are given to Gordon, and the rest are unclear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
