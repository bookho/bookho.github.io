Once a huge empire is now only a few hundred thousand people left, and Sharonville survived. He changed to become a deep red. The first minister of the kingdom’s cabinet, when Richard was absent, he took over the kingdom’s internal affairs. At the same time, Richard also handed over the internal affairs of the two newly-built countries of the Golden Valley and Green Forest. There is a shuttle between the three planes, but he insists on using Faro as a resident, and would rather endure the dizziness and pain transmitted between the planes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro is his hometown, although Jalenville is no longer an emperor, but his feet are still the land where he grew up, and it is the land of catastrophe. He has made up his mind to return Faro to his original appearance in his lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the harley finally destroyed, it is the loyalty of the eternal life of Salenville, and even some of them want to accept the mother's nest. The transformation is to become a subsidiary of the mother's nest, so that he can live longer and he can spend more time rebuilding Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Richard tells him that the consequence of becoming a mother-in-law is to gradually lose the creativity of the dúlì, slowly becoming a rigid and rigid execution unit, Salen Will only dispelled this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is Green Sen in hand, and Richard does not lack the fruit of the tree of life, and as the space lord of the old dragon, Richard can also ensure Get enough time-like grace, at least for the time being enough for the core personnel to use, so the strength of Salenwell is not strong, but life is not a problem for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Sharon Weir, Richard can let all three interiors go. He just needs to tell him what he wants. Salenwell will naturally get everything done, even though Faro is The level of the plane, the indigenous people here are limited by the strength level and the strength is not strong, but its vast territory, rich resources, such a huge base is not lacking in shocking figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranville is a born king. If he does not happen to meet Richard, the Iron Triangle Empire will reach its peak in his hands, but from another On the one hand, if there is no Richard in Faro, the Iron Triangle Empire will be stronger, and it will fall apart after the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be fate, it always takes some, and gives you some more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha returned to the library, imprinting a large amount of data from the lab bench on a magic scroll, and then loading the space bracelet until the bracelet When the data was printed, Richard immediately left the semi-position and walked into Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blue water oasis city, Palin is standing in the small square in the construction workshop, directing a group of apprentices to put the complete set of equipment on the flying raft He shouted at the discreet apprentices, but they thought they were moving too slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a warm hand patted his shoulder and someone said, "You seem to be in a hurry."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peiling did not return to the ground and said: "Crap, there is a reaper base bigger than the Blue Water Oasis City waiting for me to study, how can I not worry."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished speaking, he remembered who the voice belonged to, and he exclaimed, turned back and cried, "His Royal Highness."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "Don't be so anxious, the Reaper's base is there, you can't run at all, but you can look at this first, maybe it will help you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling took over a magic scroll handed over by Richard and opened it. He suddenly rolled his eyes and he slowly unrolled the scrolls. The more rapid the breathing, the hard to read the entire reel, Palin actually sweated, he looked at Richard, asked: "This is the design of the reaper fighter."<br /><br /> &nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just a miniature fighter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there still," Palin asked urgently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here, you can study slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peilin took over Richard Handed over the space bracelet, using consciousness to probe inside, suddenly was shocked by the hundreds of magic scrolls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "This is all my research on the reaper, they are all here, I hope I can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling has some words that can’t be said, holding this bracelet, and some stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew what he was thinking, and said: "Peilin, your strengths are not in analysis and data processing, but you have genius thinking, ability Thinking from an unprecedented perspective, this is your real strength, and the place I am most looking forward to, I think, when I come back, you will give me a surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of Richard let Palin put down the decadence of the heart, and ask: "Then you expect a breakthrough in which field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard indulged and said: "The few magic warships I ordered will soon arrive. If you can, consider whether they have any improvement."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I want to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need, you just follow your ideal magic warship to design Yes, as for how to turn your design into a practical manufacturing solution, it is naturally done by skilled craftsmen."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling nodded and said, "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled and said, "I am looking forward to you." Surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei took a sketch of the portal and walked in and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelling is standing still, has not responded for a long time, although his own level is very low, but the magic theory has reached a very high level of accomplishment, Even if Richard holds the coordinates of the two ends, but a portal is so easy to go, it is silent, and it is contrary to the magic theory that Palin knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palin only felt that the knowledge system that he had built up was suddenly overthrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know Palin’s thoughts. After he returned to Noland, all his thoughts turned to the Abyss, according to Mex’s It is said that the jīng spirit empire was the abyss, and went all the way to the Abyss abyss, and then fell short before the door across the world's light and dark sides, and stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage to the deepest Abyss in the world does not necessarily require an abyss. In theory, the same goes to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many layers in the abyss and hell. Humans have only dozens of coordinates so far. The coordinates collected by this adventurer are actually single points. The quality of the xìng, perhaps the most complete coordinates, was the abyss of Charles the Great who killed the Dragon Dharma, and now does not know whether there is a new big lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has built several abyss models and then thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem now is that humans know too little about the abyss, as well as hell, except for a few layers of abyss that are known to be connected to each other. Other than that, it seems that each other has their own dú lì, there is no way to know which layer is abyss or hell, and it is not known how far away from the Abyss abyss, whether there is a channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After absorbing the heart of Archimonde's lord, Richard also passed on some of the world's knowledge, and his understanding of the abyss is much deeper than hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A layer of abyss is not a simple superimposed structure as one might imagine, but a criss-crossing, intertwined but dú lì, like a chaotic structure of a three-dimensional maze In this case, it is not in one direction, from one abyss to another, it is possible to reach the Abyss abyss, but it may be farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, if you want to arrive in the abyss of Abis, there is only one stupid way, that is, layer by layer abyss to fight, constantly explore and position, slowly Approaching the depths of the world, so that you can continue to explore and eliminate, after all, you will find a passage to the deepest part of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year of the jīng spirit empire must have used a similar method to finally find a way to the abyss of Abis, and those who are high spirits should be lucky. There are not too many detours, otherwise they will wait for them to die, and they may not touch the edge of the Abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
