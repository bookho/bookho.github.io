If it is a six-level dissociation technique, it will not leave clothes, and there will be a pile of gray powder that is difficult to remove in place. As for the legendary spell ‘Vampires’, the creatures that die under this magic will become mummified corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand flowing toward the lighthouse standing on the side of the open space, reaching out and touching the pattern carved on the tower, carefully perceived for a moment, saying: "All the power of time It disappeared, and it is impossible for me to repair it now. The most important thing is that the time flame in the lighthouse is also extinguished. It originally contained the important plane coordinates. So, we don’t know where it is now, not yet. May return to the mainland of Noland, and people in Noland can't find our place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We lost?" Oral exclaimed . There is only one end that is lost in the turbulent flow of time, that is, destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so serious! The same kid as the girls! We have at least one plane, and we are still together!" Gangde sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde is right, but the situation is not optimistic. Losing the coordinates of the plane, I don't know how long it will stay in this strange plane, and it is no different from exile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great fortune in the unfortunate is that the geomorphology and species of this plane seem to be at least similar to the mainland of Noland, so it may be relatively easy to collect living resources. If you accidentally be thrown into an elemental plane or a place like abyss and hell, even the most basic survival will have problems. And it seems that the basic materials in the forward base are very complete, including weapons and armor that can arm hundreds of people, and food that can support for several months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden trumpet in the pub: "This steak is a bit strange, it seems to be delicious, but it is like For hundreds of years. I can't say anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't eat, let me! I have been hungry for a long time, and I have tasted my foodie. Look, it's baked just right!" Three-pointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or take it to the little girl named Liusha first, and the keen sense of magic tells me that it is weird!" Tiramisu insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres who were arguing were squeezed out of the pub. Their huge body almost made the thick fat deformed several times before they could pass through the pub's door. I don't know how they got in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu's hand is holding a whole piece of juice-dried lamb chops, which seems to have been fished out of the pot of the kitchen. When I was three-pointed, I stared at the steak and couldn’t swallow. As an ogre, you can not let your mouth drool under hunger, and you can fully self-style the ceremonial masters in the ogre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand and the thin and pretty body stood in front of the two omegas of the ogre, weak as the reeds in the wind. However, the ogres respected her, second only to Richard. Tiramisu squatted on the ground, bent over and bent over, and sent the lamb chops to the front of the drifting sand, so that she could see it more easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flower sand whispered a spell, this is the first time she needs to cast a spell. A touch of pale golden light is generated at her fingertips, turned into pieces of sand and falls on the lamb chops. The surface of the lamb chops immediately stimulated the golden light of different shades. Some areas were completely dull and dull, while some parts of the light were so strong that they directly condensed into the sand of time. In the end, it seemed to be unbearable, so that it was in the air. Squirting out to form a golden fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
