The unexpected return of several followers also increased the confidence of Richard. Finally, Richard brought Nolan, water, Tiramisu, mountains and sea, twilight and forty knights mounted on the star, and the rest left to act with the army, and the whole army was commanded by Ellie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars vacated, slowly turning direction, flying away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the star is not fast at full speed, only five or sixty kilometers per hour, but its belly is filled with high-energy beeswax made by worker bees. It can support it to fly for one month in a row, and the flight of the starburst is not affected by the terrain at all. As long as half a day, the star can directly reach the target of Richard's scheduled, and the large army of Richard will proceed according to the original plan. It will not change direction after two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The star is flying at a height of 100 meters. After a dozen hours, a huge canopy finally appears on the horizon in front, and the canopy is hundreds of meters high. Far higher than the forest level, very eye-catching, separated by a few kilometers, the tribe's guardian elves discovered the arrival of the stars, the sharp whistle of the forest one after another, many hunters jumped to the canopy, guard against defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyesight of Richard at this moment is extremely poisonous. It has already been seen that the tribe defending the emptiness called the storm giant tree, the hunters can’t even conceal their panic, this is A mature late life tree, but the number of guarded hunters is far from matching the tree of life. This confirms Richard’s guess that the main troops of the tribe have been taken away, and the tribe is in extreme An empty state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the star, Richard first looked back and saw a group of fierce followers, and then looked around and built the knight. They are also murderous. The Laya who led the team has already qualified to become a follower of Richard because of the breakthrough of the sanctuary. However, his combat power is still very young and so powerful compared with the old followers. It is enough to flatten a well-guarded tribe, not to mention that the elite warriors of the opponent have been drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One kilometer from the tree of life, the star scorpion is lowered in height, suspended in the low air that wipes the canopy, and Richard first jumps down, and followers also have Jumping, the knights built the first ride on the magic ride, only the people jumped together with the ride, the earth continued to roar, the impact of the heavy construction of the knight from the height of tens of meters is undoubtedly huge, but both Compared with the horror of the ogre, what surprised Richard was that the impact caused by the fall of the mountains and the sea even exceeded the huge ogre, which made him unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several war tree people rushed from the direction of the tree of life. They were the only heavy defensive forces in the tribe. The ancient trees of war had already been transferred to the forest camp. About dozens of guardian elves followed the war tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ordered the followers to intercept the war tree first, and he used to habitually set up the structure of the knight, grouping the team, ready to give the opponent a fatal blow, Li The speed of the whole team was a must, but when the battle of the knights had just taken shape, he was heard behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows badly, suddenly turns back, and sure enough, the wicked, sinister, and squirting guys have smashed all the war trees. To the back of the daemon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, his/mother, give me some leave." Richard wanted to roar, but wisely took it back, the number of districts Ten guardian elves, where they can withstand their killing, wait for his words to be finished, and the battle has long since ended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard and the architects came to the tree of life, the followers had already killed a round-trip under the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Zhang opened his mouth, but there was no speech. It turned out that his task was to arrange the formation of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm giant tree tribe should have about 2,000 or so ethnic groups according to the normal scale. The soldiers who are out of the country are not counted, but the number of Richards is counted. I found that the elves in the tribe were only in their early thirties. After the inquiry, Richard realized that the tribal elders had taken away about a thousand old and weak elves, and they did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha’s heart moved slightly, thinking: “Don’t the missing guardian elves have become mutated elves.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this guess is true, then there is some meaning. Richard will face more than tens of thousands of guardian elf hunters, plus tens of thousands of mutant elves, for example, the mutation wizard Just like the beast, he only acts according to instinct. There are so many opponents, and Richard is not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the construction knights finally came in handy, they were responsible for driving the surviving storm giant tree elves together, watching, Richard and follow The people began to harvest the tree of life. The consciousness of this tree of life communicated with Richard and wanted to ask for mercy, but Richard did not intend to give it another chance, but to harvest directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours, the divided tree of life was swallowed by the stars, and the young leaves, fruits, and a large number of branches, and even the roots, were filled into the storage space of the stars. The warehouse of the storm giant trees was also looted. The most valuable collections are undoubtedly the special longbow and the natural scepter, followed by many rare herbs unique to the Greenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched all the knights in the costumes go up to the stars, and they only got up, and the stars vacated, facing the foggy rain thousands of kilometers away. The forest tribe flew away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a twenty-hour long flight, the star has finally arrived in the foggy rain forest, the foggy rain forest is a relatively small tribe, the tribe is about one thousand five The hundred elves, the elite warriors of the tribe were also taken out of the air. Then, the followers of Richard solved the whole battle in a few minutes, and did not leave room for Richard. This time, Richard learned to be smart. Simply do not bother to reorganize the formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foggy rain forest is the destination that the Richards army originally pointed to. After harvesting the tree of life, the starry dragon took off again and flew to the forest wind tribe. Richard attacked the last goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the agreed time has passed, so the army of Richard began to turn to the forest wind tribe, so that the turn and the location of the forest camp There was a deviation, the forest camp had to rush to the front of the Richards, and it needed to move hundreds of kilometers. It took at least two days for the forest camp to take root to restore the people of the war tree, and the news of the direction of the army of Richard It was already a day after the forest camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of Li Chajun has many powerful people at this moment, and there is a strong town in the heavenly sanctuary level of Asiris. The guardian elves want to be near. Reconnaissance can only be filled by life. Therefore, most of them choose to hide in advance on the marching line of Richard’s army. They can observe the movements from afar. Anyway, the momentum of the army’s advancement is extremely amazing, that is, it can be heard several kilometers away. By the time I saw it, the guardian elf hunter who was responsible for the reconnaissance could not wait for Richard’s army and had to go out for reconnaissance. Only then did the army find that the army had turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the news, the forest camp was once again dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black robes pointed to the guardian elf who reported the news, and burned him directly into the fly ash with black fire, which only slightly vented the anger in the snack. In fact, the magical image clearly indicates the location and route of the army of Richard. According to the new marching route, the forest camp can only rush to the front to intercept, but there is not enough time to take root and let the war tree people recover their combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest camp in full state is not sure to be able to repel the army of Richard. The forest camp in the moving state is not to die. All the elders of the guardian elves are silent, and the black robe seems to be thinking, but everyone knows This question has no solution at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They refused to admit that the first battle of Richard’s army to break into Lin Hai really scared them, and the two sides seemed to be fighting evenly. The end result is the victory of Richard, the golden world tree of the new born in the distance, and the great advancement of the Richards army, like a slap in the face, being drawn on the dignity of the black robe and the world tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world tree starts from the initial stage, in fact, it can grow in the form of a tree of life until it grows to the late stage of the whole body, and then transforms into a world tree, the golden world tree The same is true. The advantage of this is that the tree of life does not cause many tyrannical attentions within the plane, and once the world tree appears, almost the powerful life of the entire plane will receive the message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha uses his own blood as a guide to fully stimulate the seeds of the Golden World tree. This is the secret of the Silver Moon Elf, so that when the Golden World Tree grows When it is completed, it will have an inseparable connection with Richard. In addition, the seed can be turned into a world tree from the beginning, and grows all the way as a world tree. This golden world tree, because it skips the stage of the tree of life, It is far stronger than the ordinary world tree, but it can no longer move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A golden world tree that cannot move, from the moment it was born, is the most powerful provocation to the existing world tree, its breath spreads throughout the plane As if to say: I am here, are you dare to come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the black robes need to face whether to attack the Golden World tree, but that Richard has already hit the door, and he can dare to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Add more guardian elves." When the black robe people spoke, they saw that the guardian elves were discolored, even the big words. The elders have spoken out against them. They know very well that the number of elves in the tribe is really small. In the thousands of elf tribes, it is almost impossible to say that every elf is important, and it is related to whether the tribe can develop faster. Some, then turn the tribe into a mutant elf, many tribes are on the verge of extinction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, several guardian elves suddenly rushed into the rostrum hall, watching them look irritated, the elders all floated thick The uneasiness, when the elves spoke out the news, the elders suddenly exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
