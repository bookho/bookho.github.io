Niris looked at it and let the road open. Nyris walked along the middle of the avenue, taking an elegant and steady footstep and going all the way. Looking at the back of Neris, the face of the three emperors became more and more gloomy, and almost fired in the eyes. He grabbed a follower and said, "Go and check, why do you suddenly use up all the temporary quotas! No matter what means you use, anything, anyone, find out!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Royal Treasury door not far away was slowly opened, and a team of muscle-knotted Lux ​​carrying heavy boxes and putting them on special trucks. Then a team of royal guards escorted three trucks to the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" The three emperors called the captain of the Royal Guard and asked, "What are these, where are you going to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain saw that it was the Three Emperors, and immediately reverently replied: "The car is equipped with the standard enchanting equipment, which was purchased by the Master of the Archimonde family."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I know, let's go." The three emperors quietly let the road open. When the team went far, there was only a shadow in his eyes. He said to himself: "Richard? Is he already hooked up with Nyris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower said: "Is Richard? Is that the new royal architect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three emperors’ faces are more gloomy and snorted, saying: "No matter what his identity, Nyris can give him something, I can give it to two! But if he doesn't know anything, hehe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I heard that the dead will be interested!" A follower tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Emperors just snorted and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, in the most famous restaurant in the floating world, Nyris sat with Agamemnon. In the face of the full table of dishes, he actually had some appetite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon looked up at him and said stiffly: "Eat! I pay the bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris called out: "You look down on me! This month should be paid for by me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon Say: "The bankrupt guy is not qualified for arrogance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris is stuffed with words, then he bows his head and vents himself to the table full of dishes. The anger. Full of a table of dishes, in fact, can not withstand the embarrassment of these two guys, in a blink of an eye was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon called the waiter and said, "Come on another table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His The tone is very dull, but in the face of a table of nearly 10,000 gold coins, this sentence is how to listen to how domineering. Nyris snorted and said, "You seem to have made a fortune recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well! The bet won, and by the way, I learned a few unopened eyes. Guy.” Agamemnon’s words have increased significantly, and it’s clear that this gambling war is very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nyris did not listen to him to show off the meaning of the passing, but slouched on the table, said: "My points this year ... certainly die hard to read."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in a twinkling of an eye, he was refreshed and took Agamemnon and said, "You said, is there any good way to do it? Can you get a lot of points immediately without paying too much? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon snorted and said only one word: "dark blue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nyris immediately became languid again. Philip's temperament is eccentric. Many years ago, a very complicated point system was introduced to assess the performance of each Princess of the Emperor, and the budget for the second year was determined according to the level of the points. Every prince will get a certain budget, which is the royal family's full funding for the emperors. In addition, no prince and princess will get extra help. The activities of the prince, such as the increase in personal strength, the support of more family, the performance in the plane war, and the contribution to the royal family and the alliance, etc., are counted in points. The higher the score, the more the budget. The more the budget, the easier it is to increase the points. Therefore, each emperor can easily fall into a positive or negative cycle. In order to improve the points, the princes are all deliberate and take their advantage to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a system that has never appeared in the mainland royal family is from the deep blue, and the core computing system is from the legendary mage Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon mentioned dark blue, and Nyris understood what he meant. The legendary mage is a master of mathematics in the entire Noland. Perhaps this system is flawed, but it is never Niles can find and use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slouchy finish of the meal, Niris suddenly found Agamemnon staring at himself, a look of regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Nyris began to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot an important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The feeling of Sis is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon said calmly. "Richard. Now, he has already returned to Faro. Don't you want to go with him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Nyris screamed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a lesson for you, know that no matter what kind of setbacks you have, keep calm..." Agamemnon's tone, almost Same as Philip. Only when he taught Nyris, he did not drool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Richard has returned to the Faro plane. After staying in Noland for less than a day, he prepared everything he needed, which made Richard very satisfied. If Nyris does not directly submit a large amount of materials from the royal warehouse, it can not do so quickly. The Faro plane was already late at night, only seven days passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard just stepped out of the transmission array, and suddenly heard a scream in the distance, and the voice seemed to be Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and immediately told the follower: "It seems to be Him! What's going on, go see!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went out, Richard gave orders to several followers at the same time. However, the sensed follower's position, the twilight seems to be nearby. At the same time, Richard also sent a command of consciousness to the twilight, let her immediately check the situation of Him. However, the twilight was a bit slow and there was no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard had no time to wait for the followers to react, directly rushing out of the time lighthouse, blessing himself for an acceleration, and then heading for the direction that Shim called. Viscount Himm is an important and sensitive person. In the case of the Blue River Oasis City and the Viscount-related army of more than 10,000 people, and all of them are elite troops, Richard does not want Him to have an accident. Now Richard knows how important the value of the unicorn's blood is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart was anxious, and the whole body began to faintly bloom, and the accelerated stepping method in the wizard’s sword was activated. The speed was increased by half. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the call came was an ordinary house, which had been burned in the flames of war and just covered the roof. What surprised Richard was that the twilight was standing outside the house, and the matter was not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Him?" Richard asked as soon as he arrived at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight to the room, said: "Inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the room, seeing Him is lying on the ground, his expression is sluggish, his hands are on his neck, and his chest is a pool of blood. Richard was shocked, but when he looked closely, he found that the Viscount had a strong heartbeat and was full of vitality, and there was no such thing as a serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crouched beside the Viscount, patted his shoulder and whispered: "Himm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Viscount of Shim turned slightly, and Richard appeared in the diffused pupil, and a weak voice was heard in the throat: "Yes... Richard? Are you coming back?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowns, Shen Sheng: "It's me! I am back, don't move, let me see your injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Which is expected to go to Shim suddenly yelled "Li Cha!", actually rushed into Richard's arms, burst into tears! This time, Richard was also in a hurry, and finally used magic to help the Viscount calm down from the crash. Intermittently, Richard finally understood the passage of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original count of the Earl of Heim relapsed and began to pursue a beautiful woman in the city, but he did not have to rob the means and switch to temptation. The title of the highland unicorn viscount and a strong family background is still very useful. Within a few days, Shim got two beautiful girls to get started, one of which was a low-level priest of the goddess of spring water. Just today, Him suddenly saw the half-faced human face of the twilight, and immediately became shocked by the heavens, entangled in death, and promised countless circumstances before being taken to the house by the twilight. Hem was shocked and happy, thinking that he could immediately fight a flesh. He didn't expect to just enter the house. Suddenly a black shadow flew out of the window and hit his neck. He immediately began to suck blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him is not a daring person, suddenly biting the neck and blood vessels by an unknown creature, sucking blood, scared to collapse on the spot, only screaming Counting the sound, I fell to the ground, my hands and feet were cold, and I was waiting to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha pulled down Him’s hand and looked at his neck carefully, there were two deep wounds, like bites by giant bats. . And listening to the description of Him, the attacking monster is indeed like a bat. However, the wound has stopped bleeding, and the injury is not at all serious. It takes more than one treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in addition to Richard’s dozens of elite bats in Oasis, where are giant bats that can attack humans? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha remakeed Heim’s shoulder and said, "Oh, you can’t die! Just find a pastor to treat you. Just look at it. Just look for the little pastor you hooked up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
