Otherwise, the death is faster, and the bad mood is the real enemy of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence of Richard is quoted from the famous emperor Charles the Great of the Holy Alliance. For many years, this sentence does not know how many people have misinterpreted it. Richard is one of them. Lawrence looked at the bottle and only had a small bottle of wine. He just shook his head and said, "You should eat it now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rice hasn't been delivered yet." Richard shrugged. After the bloody battle, Richard always liked to drink a few bottles, which would make His accumulated killings quietly vented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence suddenly asked: "The devil, what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察一Hey: "How to deal with it, just let it go. I didn't know what I thought at the beginning, I didn't kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence frowned: "Here It is a territorial battlefield, not a Norland, and the devil is not a child. It is a good warrior. You put him around and look for death every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is another exercise, if he can kill me, be his ability." Richard said faintly, naturally showing strong confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you have a magician doing something." Lawrence continued to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scratched his head and said, "There is no special thought. It’s just a whim. Since he didn’t kill at the beginning, he obeyed it, and now he can’t get it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil you caught is different from other devils. In my opinion, it is probably the royal family of the devil, the one they claim to be." Race, if this is the case, then his value can be much larger than other demons, which means..." Lawrence did not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What it means." Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It means that once the existence of this demon is exposed, it is likely to be levied by the Legion Fortress. The value of a demon royal family is much larger than you think. We need such a sample to conduct research, and the more the better, the better the ** sample is even more rare, he can let us know what the source of the power of the devil is, what are the weaknesses, so that we can It is more targeted in the battle with the devil. You should know that in all kinds of Dakosodas, the devil is more threatening than other races because their social form is complete and the most common individuals are very high. Wisdom is even awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard frowned, and he understood the words of Lawrence very much, just as he himself was constantly familiar with the construction of the Daksodas in the process of dividing and collecting materials in order to kill them more efficiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this demon was retained only by a moment of whim, but when these days came along, Richard’s attitude towards him changed a little. The young demon was careful, never stepped out of the room, and did not do anything stupid, so that Richard gradually forgot that he was an extremely dangerous demon, but regarded him as a pet-like existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know that Lawrence is telling the truth, Richard now feels uncomfortable in his heart, and some of them are hard to accept the fate of the devil, but put him Did he let go of him, and how many Noland strong men will die in his hands in the future? After all, this young demon is the royal family of Dakosodas, waiting for him to grow up and be a life-harvesting Terrorist war machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Expropriation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, levy, on the field of extinction, if the seniors of the Corps Fortress believe that there are suitable reasons, they can levy the property of the strongest under the jurisdiction, of course There are strict restrictions, but once the levy decision is made, it is mandatory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this devil is captured by me, press me Understand that he belongs to my private property." Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any military corps fortress, a demon royal family will be imposed. Of course, they will give you enough compensation afterwards, even far away. Some values ​​are above." Lawrence said that after a meal, he said with a deep meaning: "From the perspective of the whole war, I will definitely stand on the side of the military fortress."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to frown and meditate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this devil is simply something outside his plan, and he never thought about his destination or the use plan, and said the use value. It must have been more efficient for the military fortress. Richard himself has expertise in the construction and magic array. It is very general for magical biology. Lawrence is right, public and private. It is natural for the devil to be levied, but Richard is a place that feels uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a string in the depths of Richard’s consciousness suddenly moved, and he let him brush up and stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence was shocked, almost slammed the knife in his hand and asked: "Bad boy, what happened, scared you like this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After re-sensing, Richard said: "No, there is one of my followers who actually went to the field. I just felt it, no, I Going over and seeing, she shouldn’t be here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hurriedly bid farewell to Lawrence, Richard immediately rushed to the city, the feeling of the moment It is particularly clear, it is clearly a splash, although it feels like it is now, but it is enough to judge the position, but this limited connection is not enough to let Richard know her current state, and she has no way of knowing why. Will come to the absolute battlefield, Richard has called her several times in the run, but did not receive any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, in the tall temple near the central square in Shangcheng District, there is a strong bloody taste, and only a few dark torches are placed in the hall. The flame seedlings are strange blue-blue, translucent, without visible smoke, but constantly emitting a strong and almost greasy aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are almost all black spots in the depths of the hall. They can only see the outline of the object faintly. There is a gloomy middle-aged man sitting there. The legendary mage next to Lundested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, his face is tired, the color of his eyes is already purple, his eyes are covered with bloodshot eyes, his cheeks are a little swollen, his eyes and mouth are deep. Hanging deep down, like a mess that was wet with sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat and held a huge gold cup in his hand, which contained a cup of turbid and viscous liquid, and a slight stench, I don’t know. It was a drink made with something. He sipped in a bite, and the heavy wheezing began to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few meters in front of him, there is a stone bench made of black rock, etched with a multi-layered and extremely complex magical array, occasionally A few gold sand-like shimmers flashed, and a strong old man was lying in the center of the array. He was already asleep at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several warriors walked into the hall and saw that the older warrior on the altar was out of danger, and all of them were happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's fine, take it away." The middle-aged man waved his hand and looked very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two warriors carried the old strongman and another warrior hugged in a comatose girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior headed to the middle-aged man, respectfully said: "His Honourable Heitings, there is also a wounded here, I am afraid that only you can She rescued her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This middle-aged man is the legendary mage Heitings who lived in the country for many years, and is also a magical creature and soul. Grandmaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do I need to do it, the eternal dragon temples are doing what the priests are doing." The middle-aged voice is full of tiredness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a strong protection in her soul, and the priests of the Eternal Dragon Temple could not be cracked, so it was impossible to examine whether her soul was damaged. I can only turn to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man’s spirit is slightly longer, revealing a look of interest, and he smiled a few times, saying: The guys who are very self-satisfied finally admit that they are not as good as me. This is really a rare good news for a few days, but the protection set by anyone has made the guys of the Eternal Dragon Palace helpless. I really have some I want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man finally stood up, but the process of getting up needs to be carried out with the handrails, the whole arm is shaking, obviously physical exhaustion Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors all showed a revered look. In the war that just ended, the three legends including Heitings stood up to the other side. Legend, it has been dragged until the Black Masters' power is exhausted, and the long-lasting glory has regained its greatest power, which finally defeated the Dakso Das, and after the war, Heitings still can't rest, and needs to take care of those souls. The impaired strong, so that a legendary mage in the hall, will actually be tired to the station is a bit unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So although Heitings has a lot of quirks and a very bad temper, he still enjoys wide respect in the days of the sun, just as Lawrence did. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Hastings nodded, the headed warrior hurriedly put the girl on the magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
