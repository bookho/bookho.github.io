			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hotel is late in the night, Richard is still not sleepy He rearranged the magical alarms and magic traps around the hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The killer is the natural enemy of the Master, and the Master also has numerous means of restraining the killer. For example, magic alarms and traps, as long as they are advanced, can make the vast majority of killers helpless. Many magics have a soul lock and tracking effect. If the killer is discovered by the wizard, then the end is not much better. Richard's arrangement comes from dark blue, the Faro plane behind the magic level, not to mention the ordinary killer, that is, the magic assassin can not crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the opponent has a big magician of level 14 or above, take more time and perhaps cancel the magical alert of Richard. But the magician is not a killer, it is difficult to hide his breath, and it is almost impossible to get through the nose of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged for defense, Richard took out the newly-made structure and set off for the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a bonfire burning in the calm military camp, and most of the tent curtains had been put down. There was almost no moving figure except the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a place where the shadows are shaking. The tiramisu and Gangde are sitting around and drinking. The two had already piled up four or five empty wine barrels, and two of them had not been opened, but it was obviously not enough for them to drink tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wok on the bonfire, which is boiling the soup that Tiramisu is best at. However, only Tiramisu put a bowl in front of him, and Gangde only had a wine tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the campfire, sat down, handed the magic box in his hand to Tiramisu and said, "This is me for a three-point meal." The construction of the standard, the initial strength of the standard version. I did not expect that... just do it, it will not be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu, Did not pick up the magic box, but said: "Master, we ogre ... can also use the structure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All life can be used Installed," said Licha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu still did not pick up the box, habitually scratching his head and said: "But I have never heard of any ogre ever. This is said to be very expensive and can be exchanged for many barrels of wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The standard version of the primary strength, in the words of Noland, roughly 100,000 gold coins Around," Richard said faintly. What he did not explain is that the price of the structure from his hand often far exceeds the price. This primary force can sell at least 150,000 gold coins because of the magnitude of the bonus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"100,000 gold coins, according to the top ten ale, ten gold coins a barrel, is 10,000 barrels of wine. If you change half into cattle, it is 3,000, oh It’s enough for me to eat for more than ten years. In fact, I can save a bit. I don’t have to eat and drink such good things, I can eat for a lifetime.” Tiramisu quickly converted the value of this structure according to his own measurement. The ogre is actually very clever, and the magician is used to dealing with numbers. So the speed of tiramisu is very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true." Richard threw the box to Tiramisu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu kept scratching his head, looking at the makeup look a bit strange, as if the hand was not a light floating box, and It is thousands of fat cows and fine wines. "But, the three-point ripening has never been used again, master, don't waste it, give it to others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a three-pointed thing, not someone else." Li gaze at the bonfire of the jump, sighed and said: "You have been with me for so long, and have never got anything. This structure Even if it is a memorial to him, you can also bury it with the three-point familiarity according to human customs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three points If you don't need to be buried, he will be with me soon." Speaking, Tiramisu pointed to the boiling pot. Richard noticed that there was a thing in it that contained a load, although it had been reduced to one-third of the original volume, but it was still able to identify the head that was actually three-pointed. And its body has been turned into a ash by magical flames, and there is no more thing to bury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu took the soup pot, regardless of the hot soup, took out the three-pointed head and began to eat. Every action of the Ogre Magi is extremely serious and serious. It seems that a devout ceremony is taking place, and the whole person reveals a certain sacred taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Gangde looked silently and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the only part of the skull is the skull, and the last piece of meat on the top is tiramisu. It seems that the pot of broth is secret. Cooking, not only the size of the skull is shrunk, but the gloss is also different from that of ordinary bones, showing a sleek azure-like azure color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the sorcerer pours all the broth into his stomach, then puts his head into the soup pot and cleans every corner of it. . After doing all this, he threw the soup pot aside and patted his belly hard and said, "Now I can feel it. The three-point ripening has already settled here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Tiramisu took out an iron chain that had already been prepared, put the three-pointed skull in his neck and hung it around his neck. "In this way, when I avenge him for the future, he will be able to see it!" said the eater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and down on Tiramisu and said, "In this case, then this structure will be used on you, and it should be three points." Cooked as a companion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiramisu did not think much, but opened his mouth and smiled happily. In his mind, this structure is indeed accompanied by a three-point familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of implanting the assembly is very simple, and the area of ​​the ogre is quite large. Eventually this structure was planted on the chest of tiramisu, and the usual three-pointed skull could just be pressed on it. In a few minutes, Richard completed all the work. As for the strength of the construction of the ogres magician how much improvement, but no one will go deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ogre Magi is different from other racial wizards in that they have a slightly weaker ability but are very powerful and physically strong. They are the smartest ogres, but they have not forgotten the instinct of the ogre battle. When mentioning the warhammer, tiramisu is also a frightening killing machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde, Tiramisu, and Richard are sitting next to the campfire, and they are not screaming and drinking. Two barrels of spirits quickly bottomed out, and neither the two and the ogres were drunk. Their faces are very serious, their eyes are all in the bonfire of jumping, and there is almost no conversation between them. I don't know what to think about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde poured the last casks all over, only dripping out the last few points from the inside, only to helplessly throw the casks aside. He simply grabbed the giant axe and began to wipe it. While working, he asked: "Hey, do you hate the red Cossack?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
