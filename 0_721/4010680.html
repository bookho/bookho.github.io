			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You,..." The young mage named Link was obviously not expected To Qi Qi is so determined, he originally thought that he would have a heavy weight in Qi Qi's heart, at least in her hard-built magic workshop, he consciously still plays a decisive role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link’s tone turned soft and said: “珞琪, you know that as the heir to my count, I will stay in this place for three years, like a coolie. Just work every day, why, isn't it for you? Otherwise, it is inevitable that I will become a big builder in my future, why bother to do this kind of hard work."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the big framer, Richard took the insight and swept it over the man, and immediately judged that his magic is now at the 16th level, but the magic achievement stops at the big magician. Even the big magician will be very difficult. Without the magical support, this young mage will probably stop at the second-order structure in his life. The big master is obviously bragging. Maybe he really thinks he has this future, just Richard is not sure where his self-confidence comes from. Is there any secret method that can greatly improve a person's magical talent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 said: "You can choose to go back to be your count, I am still willing to stay here, here is the world he gave me, I will not leave No matter what kind of conditions you propose, I will not leave because I have already sold myself and sold it to Richard. I can’t sell it for the second time.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke pale, suddenly whispered: "You don't think that Richard has a status, he is just a woman's little white face, if there is no support from His Highness, he will have so many Money, if he suddenly died, how can he be a master so early, he can have everything today, but he is lucky, he is born, what is he, but all this will pass, my family has After investing in the new emperor's undecided, His Majesty will soon start to work on Archimonde. Whenever Richard will have nothing, hehe, a nouveau riche, really thinks that it can be compared with our long-established old family. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qi was stiff and his face changed slightly, then slowly eased down and said, "Linke, if you are telling the truth, then give me some time to think about it. I will give you a reply in a few days." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke suddenly laughed and smiled a little oddly, saying: "珞琪, but I don't want to give you time, you don't know, once I don't know When you leave here, you will inform Richard as soon as possible. If you are sincere, then give me your body now, I can't wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, Link rushed to the top and threw himself down to the inability to defend him. He grabbed the neckline of Master Qi Qi’s robe and tried to tear it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Link used several times in succession, and Qiu’s collar did not move, just as the clothes were made of the hardest material in the plane. He tried again, but suddenly realized that it wasn't that Qi Qi's clothes were too strong, but that his strength was too weak, even weak enough to even clench his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qi Qi’s eyes suddenly showed a happy color, interrupting a magical to half of the magic, the third-level Thundercloud is not very powerful, perhaps only let Lin Gram's arm was slightly numb, but it would touch the alarm device in the laboratory, and the nearest elite squadron knight could come immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 pushed Link down with both hands, then jumped up and flew to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke rolled to the ground, and found that he was not light and powerless, and the whole body was weak to the extreme, and at most he could barely turn his head and even climb. Not up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke tried his best and finally turned his head, but he saw a young man at the door of the lab, and Qi Qi was flying over and rushed into it. In his arms, Link was so angry that he had to blast his head, screaming and slamming the ground, but he could not climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the young man at the door said faintly: "In my weakness, I will lie on the ground for five minutes, you can't climb." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke only felt that a basin of ice water poured down from the head, because he had already recognized the coming person, and now he shouted: "Licha."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, Link said again: "This is a weak technique, impossible, what have you done to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Weakness is a three-level magic, the role is to weaken the target strength, the degree of weakening is generally two or three percent, this magic often appears in the battle of low-level wizards, used to deal with strong power and magic defense The weak opponent, Link said how to be a 16-level magician, his magic resistance is very strong, ordinary weakness is on him, and even half of the effect is left, it will not affect his actions, but Richard threw a weak technique, but almost weakened his power to zero, and could not stand even in the station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard did not intend to waste time explaining what Link did. After destroying the real name and combining the power of the blue moon, it is not only a weak technique. Now, any low-level magic is out of the hands of Richard, the power is unimaginable, and the area is Debilitating, Richard wants Lin to lie for five minutes, and he won't get up in four and a half minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi took a hard look at Richard, then looked up and said: "Licha, I heard that the undecided Queen wants to deal with you, be careful."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a picture of Qi Qi’s back and comforted him: “I have heard it, nothing, don’t worry, it’s not irrational, but it’s not sensible. It is precisely the opposite, the majesty is likely to be an emperor who has made a difference. As for the clowns who are going to hold their upper thighs, huh, we don’t have to put them in our eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke on the ground heard the evaluation of the clown, suddenly rushed into the air, angered: "Licha, how long do you think you can be proud, turbidity adults personally told my father, morning and evening I want to put you to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled and said, "Yes, he wants to kill me, but the turbidity has not only been said, but also done. And more than once, but the result, if he is not lucky, he is dead, he did not tell your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Linke sneered: "Despite your bragging, you will kill me if you have the ability. My father will know that I am going to happen sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at Richard uneasily and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't handle this and I was in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha laughed: "It's none of your business. It's a strange thing to be a big beauty like you. It's a strange thing to remember. As for this trouble, I can handle it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞Qi glanced at Link. He saw that he was full of grievances and anger. He did not mean to succumb to softness. She frowned and said, "Li Cha, his character is paranoid, and because of me. The reason... I hate you very much. He is very familiar with the process of our two series of workshops. The situation of the blue water oasis should also be understood. I saw him coming and going to the city hall several times, so I can’t let him go out. Secretly kill him, then find a suitable excuse to inform his family, for example, we have been to the Zuyuan Heights in recent years. Into religious war mage battle damage is a normal thing "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Link’s whole body was shocked. I didn’t expect that once Qi Qi had a decision, it would be so ruthless, but Richard didn’t think there was anything. The Qi Qi, known as the “most beautiful pearl of Mensa”, was carefully cultivated from an early age. What is a weak and gentle woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Link and said, "You don't need such trouble. He just wanted to force you, then it's damn enough, I will send someone to him." Bring back to Fu Shide and publicly execute it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke’s face is fierce and bites his teeth: "Lee, my family will not let go." Yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "If they want to die early, even if they come to me, trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Richard, this is not very good." Qi Qi is still worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linke’s family is not a floating island, but it is also a duke family. Only the younger Linke can inherit a Piaget territory, knowing this. The family is good, and this matter is related to Qi Qi. Qi Qi does not want to give Richard a strong enemy for her own sake, because she knows that Richard has enough enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and said: "Don't worry, my patriarch's position is played."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After that, Richard called in two elite knights, let them take Lin out, hold them up, and send them back to Faust in tomorrow, and they will be executed in public. Before that, Sand will go first. See him, make some small exchanges with Link’s soul, and make sure that he will not reveal his secrets whether he is alive or not after returning to Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After processing this little episode, Richard took the magic box in his hand and said to Qi Qi: "This is the gift I brought to you. Open it and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 put the magic box on the table, opened it, and suddenly exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic box, the most striking thing is a deep black magic pen, look at the delicate lines, hard to copy work, and pen body Covering the layers of miniaturized magic array, Qi Qi immediately concluded that this is an artifact level magic pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a builder, there is nothing better than a high-quality magic pen. "This is for me." There is some tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
