			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An imperial cavalry suddenly fell from the sky and fell to Richard. He was extremely quick-moving, and he climbed up as he turned over. At the same time, he opened the rifle in his hand and pulled out the sword to stab Richard's horse's belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Li, Li Mang flashed, and the long knife was extinct. The Imperial Cavalry suddenly grabbed his face and screamed and fell. The sword in his hand has already been broken into two pieces at the moment of double-edged attack. There is extinction in hand, and what Richard really needs to do is to make his own knife faster and more sturdy, which is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a knife, the enemy suddenly looked up, just in front of him, the Io in the battle seems to be in the interim period of the magical cast, but nothing I was idle, didn't care about the two elite warriors who followed the escorts, but instead cleverly strode into the arms of another Imperial Cavalry. Io’s hand had somehow caught the neck of the cavalry and twisted his backhand and suddenly broke his cervical spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the enemy, Io also looked up and smiled at Richard, and the eyes of both sides ignited the flame in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great magician, how much are you going to kill?" Io asked provocatively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes and said, "At least one hundred!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is you The ability of Yiguo?" Io smiled and raised his hand to the throwing soldiers, saying: "I can make these things only die ten!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You really have this ability, then even if I lose this time!" Richard sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people passed by and worked towards different goals. In an instant, the light of magic and magic illuminate each other, almost ruining all the brilliance of the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two men know that there is not much time left for them. I don't want this battle of the striker to become a battle against the enemy's main force, and it must be quick and quick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the multiple attacks of rank, equipment, magic, and magic, the two thousand cavalry of the empire quickly collapsed, showing signs of chaos and retreat. They are not brave enough, but the enemy's attack is too fierce, and the fierceness is beyond the common sense. Even if these empire elite cavalry, watching the peers fall into pieces, the moment is also taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment when the enemy retreated, Richard immediately gave orders to all followers and elite combat units to retreat. A fire wall separates the warriors from the Imperial Cavalry, and hundreds of elite warriors quickly retreat, and the camp is still extremely rigorous when retreating. The throwing soldiers suddenly threw the last short axe in their hands! This is their melee weapon, and once they are thrown, they are bare-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of flying axe whistling out, instantly overturning dozens of cavalry. Let the remaining pursuers stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short and incomparably fierce battle came to an end. When Salenwell led a group of generals to the battlefield, the gates of Lanshui Oasis City just closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville looked pale and glanced at the bodies of hundreds of Imperial Cavalry in front of him. The generals behind him were equally awe-inspiring and kept silent. The generals who led the front cavalry were kneeling on the ground, and the head almost fell to the ground, and the sweat was rolling down. In the piles of bodies of the imperial knights, there are indeed the bodies of the soldiers of the Richards, but the number is very poor. No matter how many, it will not exceed fifty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one to ten battle loss ratio! This time, the people used by Saranville are not the horses, but the emperor group with the number, but the battle-to-loss ratio has expanded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell suddenly turned and pointed at the generals, roaring in extreme anger: "I keep telling you, never underestimate! No matter what Richard has How many soldiers must use all their strength! This is the answer you gave me? There are four thousand cavalry in the hand, but only two thousand. Now look at the body of the Imperial Warrior, are you awake?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals listened quietly to the roar of Saranwell and looked ashamed. A moment later, a burly general suddenly stepped forward and said: "His Royal Highness, let us rush directly into the city! The other side has only two holy areas, and we have a total of five!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville’s face sank and said, “Crush in? Look for death?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..." The general wanted to fight, but was interrupted by Saranwell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville did not issue new instructions, but walked around the battlefield, sinking into the water. He suddenly went to the cavalry general who was still on the ground and said, "Get up, reorganize your team, you still have one night. Tomorrow morning, I hope to see a cavalry like before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Your Highness!" The cavalry general squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell also told the generals: "Clean the battlefield, camp, rest today, and attack the city tomorrow morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not encircle the city? What do they do when they ran?" asked a general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell glanced at Lanshui Oasis City, gloomy face and said, "No! Richard is very smart, he knows that I just want him." Run away, so he will never run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, Saranwell said slowly: "This Richard is thinking about This place has killed me. If this is the case, then I will compete with him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Your Highness, you are not saying that Richard is very commanding on the battlefield. Is it amazing? Maybe when you are attacking the city, it is more effective to concentrate on the sanctuary and the great magician on our side and directly attack his Chinese army." Another general proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell touched the finely-trimmed short beard and suddenly smiled and said, "You are not the brainless sanctuary who only knows how to move the knife." You are all generals who can lead the army! And the value of you as a general is far more important than the personal power of the sanctuary. How can I take you to risk? Don't worry about Richard! I admit that if the commander is the same amount The army, I will definitely try to avoid Richard. Even if my soldiers are only half more than Richard, I will seriously consider fighting with him. But now, we have 30,000 elite imperial warriors! And Richard There are only less than 10,000 people. The ones that really belong to him are more than a thousand points. This is definitely not the war that Richard wants!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Licha can always defeat the same number of enemies, and I will always let my enemies find that his strength is much less than mine. This is the difference between me and Richard." After a meal, Sarlenville Then he said: "Since one-on-one hits Richard, then I will use two to one, or even three to one force to deal with him. Now, the contrast between us and him is three to one! So you have no confidence in this advantage? Do I still need to use my best generals to take risks?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Saranwell said with unprecedented majesty: "Richard is a great general, but I am a great commander!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The generals rekindled their fighting spirit. The morale of Richard’s head-on blow was once again boosted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the army outside the city began to retreat in an orderly manner, and camped, Richard did not feel the eyebrows wrinkled. At this time, Iowa also took to the city, stood next to Richard, and glanced at the outside of the city, saying: "This opponent is very unusual! This time you are afraid of being bad."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha faint smile: "How do you know if you haven't played? Why, are you afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russian tone Said: "If a person who has not even killed a hundred cavalry is not afraid, then what am I afraid of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And replied: "You haven't won yet? My throwing soldiers have died far more than ten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short battle, Richard's Range magic killed less than 80 cavalry, and Io tried every effort, and nearly 20 throwing soldiers died. Neither of them could complete the bet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io-Russia looked at the imperial army that was busy camping outside the city, calmly smiled and said: "It doesn't matter, then we still have time to bet. These two days, I will become a 14th-level priest. I am very curious, how can a 12-level magician fight with a 14th-level priest."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't reached level 14, and I won't always be level 12." Richard is tit-for-tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The days are still long, and there are still many battles. Time will verify everything." Iowo continued to smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, "Really, time will verify everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the battle priest and There is nothing to say between the great wizards, each looking at the enemy forces outside the city, thinking about each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville has no siege at all, and there is no need to encircle the city. Richard knows that once he leaves the blue water oasis and can barely be used to resist the topographical protection, the cavalry of Sarenville will follow. In the constant interception and flight, Richard’s troops will continue to lose blood, the best. The result is to escape a few elite troops. This is not the result that Richard wants! After losing the army, Salenwell can concentrate on the strong, begin to cut off the followers of Richard, and finally try to keep Richard in the blood of the land forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way is to rely on the city to resist for a period of time, killing the soldiers of Salenville in large numbers, and then retreating. At that time, the exhausted Emperor team was mostly unable to chase, but only watched Richard leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Richard is thinking about the third option, which is to turn the blue water oasis city into a huge meat grinder! Every bit of it drastically cleaned the forces of Salenwell. This is a crazy plan, but in Richard's calculations, the success rate is not as low as it is to give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not think about going to escape. Like in the blood-stained land, Richard is ready to give Saranwell a new 'surprise'. After passing through the iron wall and the magic, Richard has established confidence in the combat effectiveness of his own troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when the sun once again heats the red land of the blood-stained land, the emperor of the strict team has been listed outside the blue water oasis city* * The team, urging the dull drums, in addition to taking a neat pace, such as the tsunami wave peak, moved to Oasis City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
