			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone feels different about time lapse, sometimes feels like The white cricket runs too fast, sometimes like a sandstone person with a certain earth element plane, a Noland time that kisses for a thousand years is slow and horrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the title of the legendary mage, both Richard and Stevenson are moving toward their goals in their own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as in the past, life and work schedules have remained basically unchanged, and even magical cultivation and meditation have not been interrupted. I just slightly adjusted the schedule and used some of the learning time for the philosophy of magic in the magic structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it didn’t take long for Richard to find himself in the wrong direction. In the course of constructing design learning, several courses were to analyze and dissect the classic examples of predecessors. In order to understand the master's design philosophy, he had to go back and read the basic theory many times, and then he was surprised to find the expression technique. The complicated and fascinating design of the magical design is based on the understanding and understanding of the magic world. As a result, Richard knows that he does not lack the knowledge of the magical array, but instead needs to strengthen his philosophical achievements in magical philosophy, which is more conducive to his creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Richard also began to contact the manufacture and installation of the modular plug-in, a magical pattern to be installed on the snow rabbit to really play a role. The mature magic pattern inserts can be combined with the body of the target creature and eventually become part of the body, similar to a tattoo. Further, it is to directly draw the magic lines on the body of the target creature. Only such a structure can truly combine with the target and become unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, to create a new magic pattern, magic materials science has become a key area. What kind of material is used to achieve the corresponding effect is not as simple as it seems. Even with the same kind of Warcraft, the skin of different parts of the body may have different magic effects, and the processing of leather can be as many as nearly 100 kinds, eventually producing at least thirty or forty different enchanting skins with different magical attributes. The magic pattern involves more than a thousand kinds of materials, plus the different processing techniques in the middle and late stages, and each master figure has more or less his own unique techniques. The combination is completely unimaginable. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Richard explored in the vast maze, learning and practicing the basic techniques needed to make the magic pattern. He is very patient, not in a hurry, step by step, and at most it is a few days to review the effects of the previous stage of learning, and then slightly adjust the schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are many shortcuts to magic materials, such as asking for a family. The Akmon family is again seen as a nouveau riche. After all, it is also a model of successful outbreaks. The materials that can be provided to Richard and the pre-treatment process will definitely be dozens of times stronger than the ones he personally brewed. Such as Stevenson's refined flames, the material of the dragon skin, even if it is extremely precious, the Archimonde family can not get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Richard C. can use the ordinary World of Warcraft skin that is 1,500 times cheaper, and he is not willing to take a flame from Gotton. Even though he is soberly aware of the importance of high-grade magic materials for the quality of the finished parts, he stubbornly ignores this little convenience and looks for his own way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is another busy way. He communicates with Santa Cruz almost every day to discuss the magical structure of the snow rabbit. Install the program. And he also started a lot of targeted exercises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
