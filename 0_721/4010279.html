			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is completely lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light golden light shines through the long curtain and casts deep and shallow geometric figures on the floor in front of the long window of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the heart and suddenly felt that his eyes were sore and painful, and the two lines of tears flowed down. The writings left by the white night are also full of murderous murder. After watching it for a long time, his eyes can't bear it first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li closed his eyes and sat down on the ground, resting for a while, and suddenly felt that there was something in the room. He suddenly turned around and saw the huge box in the middle of the room, and he was shocked. However, Richard thought about it, and only had white nights, so he could enter the floating island so silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde Floating Island is full of war fortress styles, but apart from a 20-meter-tall tower, there is no airspace such as a magic barrier. defense. But the floating island is still under the bathing of the eternal and the dragon of time. In addition to the people of the eternal dragon temple, those who are malicious and murderous cannot enter and leave without warning from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha some curious what the white night brought, when he opened the box, he immediately took a breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This box is actually a space device with a strange behemoth head, a huge organ that is still stubborn and creepy, similar to a certain creature. The heart, as well as a small statue, is engraved with a strange creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only took a look and knew that these three pieces are not only sacrifices, but also the top sacrifices! The value of each piece is higher than the head of a big devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take these three sacrifices for gold coins, you will be worth at least 30 million. And having a top-level offering is tantamount to having a hope that no one will come up with a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the sacrifice, Richard is a bitter smile, shook his head helplessly. This white night, but still refused to owe him. Richard is very clear that even with the power of white nights, it is necessary to have the experience of nine deaths in order to get these three sacrifices. It can be seen that she is so urgent that she needs life to be ruined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha closed the box and thought about it. He simply asked the four dragon knights who guarded the floating island to come over and let them help carry the box to eternity. Go to the Dragon Temple. I heard that the box contained the sacrifices for today's sacrifice, and the four knights agreed to it. Richard also gave up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to come to Faust, no one dares to rob the Dragon Knight escort, it is equal to the eternal dragon temple. Under the power of Vatican's great priests back to time, no one wants to conceal the conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three top-level offerings, even Richard is nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Richard finally stepped into the Eternal Dragon Hall, and a hanging heart finally fell. He rubbed the fine sweat on his forehead and then took a long breath. When Richard could exhaust thousands of magic materials for his life, he thought he had not put money in his eyes. However, the tension on the road made Richard understand that he just did not put millions in his eyes, and tens of millions of people were still nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcomed to the Nolan Grand God official, she smiled and said to Richard: "Lee, come with me, Vatican is waiting for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the way, Nolan by the way told Richard that the Faroese minerals and specialties brought back this time were all evaluated, totaling 3.5 million gold coins, and then asked what method to use to convert the payment, whether it is gold or magic crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Crystal." Richard is now lacking a lot of magic crystals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time your sacrifice will be personally hosted by the Vatican Grand God, a rare opportunity!" Nolan smiled and said. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, even the top-level sacrifice ceremony Vatican has rarely appeared in the host, such as the Nolan level of the big priest is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony hosted by Vatican will give the sacrificer a much greater chance of getting the grace he needs. In rare cases, Vatican can even intervene in the offering of the gods of sacrifice, which is the privilege of the eternal and the dragon of time. It is only behind this glory that few people have noticed the price they paid. The nobles will only calculate how much they need to pay to be able to impress the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vatican's great priest? Why is it not sand?" Richard was surprised. Hosting sacrifices can be divided into gods, and flowing sand is in need of grace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan with a stern expression, said: "There are some key issues to be dealt with in the past two days. Don't worry, there is a Vatican priest who personally presided over the offer. Sacrifice, what do you need, it should not be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha slightly frowned and accepted the arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an empty apse of the Dragon Hall, Richard once again saw Vatican. The beauty of the great priest combines the qualities of maturity and purity, and has the depth of penetration. Seeing again, perhaps this time is particularly relaxed, perhaps the level of wisdom, and Richard feels the beauty of Vatican more than any time before, because of the unique qualities, it is the beauty that cannot be copied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in the back hall, but the cleaning is particularly clean, and there are no pillars supporting the dome in the hall. Vatican sat in the middle of the hall like this, and the shoes were placed beside him, waiting quietly for his arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at him and learned how she was sitting opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You find me?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin looked at Richard seriously and asked after a moment: "Are you already twenty?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard thought about it, he nodded and said, "Yes." I have been in different planes for a long time, sometimes forgetting my age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline floated a faint smile and said: "In that year, he was just twenty years old, but he was much more powerful than you are now. At that time, I also Very young. We always think that the whole world will be ours in the future. But ten years later, we began to doubt the original idea. Twenty years later, I found out that I was so small, before the power of destiny, all of us Struggling is so empty and weak. Later, in desperation, we chose to sacrifice each other and then never farewell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her plain narrative, Richard Suddenly I felt that the breathing was also heavy, and it seemed to be suppressed by the power of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican suddenly smiled and said: "It’s too far. Just seeing you today is like seeing us in the past. Well, I just want to ask you a question. What do you think is the real cornerstone of the strong? "Blood, structure, grade, or something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li thinks, then tries to say: "Blood? Not right... Level is also important But if it is a fifth-order structure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanlin said: "All right, not right. In fact, blood power is not mysterious, most of them are strong. All have strong blood power, but many of them are not born with strong blood. The blood power can be excavated, can be promoted, and even plundered. The eternal and the dragon of time also often have different kinds of grace. The blood is strong. So the strong will have their own blood power sooner or later. As for the level, since you have been to Calando and have been to the field, you should know that the level is not all. The legendary strongman died in heaven. The example on the hands of the sanctuary is not uncommon. Then, the rest is built. The structure is actually better than the front. The larger limiting factor, or conversely, is because it limits the development of the strong, which is the more important factor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" then I should Continue to deepen the structure?" Richard tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Construction is only one of the factors, but it is not the only way for the strong. In fact, the strongman of the Calando continent is not constructed. Installed. And some of our top performers do not use any structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not use the structure?" I was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are far from this level, it is something that you have to start thinking about when you need to find your own path after you step into the legend. Now, you are still honest, what to use for anything! Construction, equipment, artifacts, nothing can be less." Vatican laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and asked, "What is the road to the strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Vatican said softly: "The real strong, except for a few special talents or special encounters, almost have a strong heart. In fact, the so-called strong heart, nothing more than a few samples They are tenacious and can persevere, but they also have the courage to dare to face everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a while, this passage seems Where have you heard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Richard seems to have returned to the village of Rutherland. At that time, he saw that a small tree felt so tall. At that time, the happiest time of the day was to sit at the table in the evening and listen to the story of the mother while eating a big meal. Elannie’s voice is always so gentle and so sweet. When her voice sounded, it seemed that the flowers in the mountains would sway open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small mountain village far from the world, at the age of seven, Richard remembered to be persevering in doing things. When he was eight years old, Richard learned tough. Then at the age of nine, Richard had the courage. Then ten years old...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years old, it is an indescribable pain, and the fire and confusion have been buried deep in the heart of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small time, the heart of the strong man that Vatican said was already a habit of Richard and a part of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!" When he looked up again, Richard's eyes were bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
