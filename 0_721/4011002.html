			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used a heavy army to encircle the battle, which killed a mechanical warfare. However, the reaper has not many war elephants, and there are only a dozen or so heads in the entire battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no face to most of the time not to participate in the battle, just to assist Richard to optimize the local command. Regardless of the unit of the reaper, she can find their shortcomings in the shortest possible time. The team that killed the mechanical war elephant was her temporary group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the team's Elf killer retreated to the rear and began to reload Raytheon. The two-winged Crimson Warrior was transferred to protect the night elf killer, and the flesh-and-blood warriors who flocked came to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face suddenly flashed into the enemy line, the two swords continued to sway, and more than a dozen spider soldiers mixed in the flesh-and-blood warriors were instantly strangled, then flashed into the air After crushing two medium-sized fighters in a row, it was only after the return to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face to stop, ordinary crimson soldiers immediately rushed, and flesh-and-blood warriors and half of the spider warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average of these ordinary fighters is only about seven or eight levels, and the combat power is three or four levels worse than the flesh-and-blood warriors. It is often necessary to pay several times the life of an opponent before they can kill a flesh-and-blood warrior. However, none of these fighters retreated, showing that they are not weaker than their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the war hits this, everyone understands that in the face of the reaper’s terrorist army, everyone’s ending is a death, or a restless death. . Since the left and right are dead, of course, it is necessary to drag more reapers to cushion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ordinary warriors know that the longer they delay, the weird and powerful warriors behind them can kill more reapers. Up to now, about 90% of the reapers have died in the hands of the night elves, the nesting units and the strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wars of these ordinary warriors are insignificant in killing, but without them, Richard’s night elves may have suffered more than half of the casualties, not the basics now. In good condition, it can continue to pour firepower and continue to kill a lot of reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Druids continue to cast thorns to bind a piece of flesh-and-blood warriors in place. At this time, a team of night elf warriors who cooperated with them would rush forward, holding Raytheon and blasting the terrible metal jets on these flesh-and-blood warriors. Each Raytheon bomb can hit these flesh-and-blood warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part of Druid is constantly entangled in the air with lightning-like fighters. The speed of the hanged thorns will drop by more than half, and the night elf shooter's magic tracking arrow will arrive in time to blast it into parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the local battlefield, it seems that the night elves and the knights have completely controlled the situation, but Richard is not happy at all. There is only one reason: too many reapers. The kingdom warriors are consuming rapidly, and the consumption and speed are almost the same as those of the reapers. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the reaper had a quantitative advantage, and consumed at the same speed, and the soldiers of the Dark Red Kingdom were consumed, and the night elf team was immediately exposed. At that time, the war will enter the most difficult stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha floated in the air for a moment, slightly restored a little magic, and repaired the injury by the way, then flashed, appearing directly in the Reaper Land The center of the unit. Then a circle of blue fire centered on him and quickly spread out, and it gradually dissipated until it was dozens of meters away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood of the reaper that was contaminated by the blue fire immediately violently burned, and the flesh-and-blood warrior fell down, while the spider warrior was able to resist it for a while, but also Can't hold on for long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single shot hits thousands of flesh-and-blood warriors and a dozen spiders, but this amount is really too much compared to the Reaper army. Insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao sinks into the water, takes out the book of destruction, and quickly flips it. In an instant, two elf prophets and two bloody arbitrations appear in Richard’s army. . Their appearance immediately stabilized the surrounding situation, but unfortunately this improvement is still too limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been involuntarily starting to breathe a little. In order to hit the most threatening ship at the fastest speed, he almost hit all the direct attacks. While killing the big ship, Richard also consumed a lot of magic power, and also suffered a minor injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Richard is tired and hurt like this, other people naturally will not be better. The three-packed knights have a clear defect, and there are more than a dozen rides and deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Richard’s vision, there will always be unwilling roars from the Frost Warrior, slowly falling down. In the process of their fall, there will be countless high-energy beams repeatedly attacking those bodies that have gradually lost their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of reapers is still huge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Richard is already very heavy. He subconsciously put all the calculated damages behind him, and whispered, suddenly a hundred meters ahead, and the holy sword dragged a bright red flag on his side. Wherever Jianguang passed, all the reaper units, whether flesh-and-blood warriors or spiders, were divided into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly went straight to the sky, his figure flashed a few flashes, and several medium-sized fighters burned from the air. His figure continued to flicker, appearing behind a war elephant with no one to check and balance, and screamed, the sword of the sword swelled for dozens of meters, and even a sword would open the battle elephant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are already very clear about the characteristics of the reaper, knowing that these flesh-and-mechanical monsters are not so easy to kill, opening more times is just a limitation. Their ability to act. Therefore, a team of night elves and frosty knights rushed into the wind, dozens of Raytheon continued to roar, and in a blink of an eye shot the bomb. The metal torrent shredded the flesh and blood of the war elephant and destroyed his skeleton, which completely wiped out this horrible war machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard turned to find the next target, the battle elephant wreck suddenly jumped a humble figure: 984. This number makes Richard’s eyes Twitched a bit. This is the data that the wisdom talent has combined to synthesize all the information about the brain. It is the number of soldiers who died under this battle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time to lift off the plane again. This time she is even more embarrassed. She only smashed three medium-sized fighters and returned to the ground to serve as pure conductor. character of. In the local battlefield command, the facelessness that can cut into the parental command system is no worse than that of Richard, and even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless results don’t seem to be much, but Richard knows that this is not the case. She only kills the most valuable targets, even small fighters do not touch. Since the war, no face has shot down more than 20 medium-sized fighters, ruining seven of the fifteen battles, plus nearly a hundred spider warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the number of reapers is still too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the ordinary warriors in the Dark Red Kingdom has reached more than 70%. In many places, the night elves have already thrown the thunder, pulled out the long sword, and began to fight with the flesh-and-blood warriors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that Raytheon is not good, but the disk has been emptied. Behind the power of Raytheon's super high is a huge supply of ammunition and supplies. Each night elf carries an average of 30 rounds, but the battle has not yet entered the endgame, and the bouncing plate has already been emptied! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, the roar of Thor was quickly and quietly silenced, and the heart of Richard was sinking together. His face turned cold, and three faces suddenly appeared in his body. The three orders of the gods were launched at the same time. Three fire balls of different nature were shot separately and gathered together in midair. They miraculously did not explode, but instead merged together, a negligible explosion occurred, and then disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those who noticed this detail are staying. The legendary ability of Richard's Three Realms has long been known. At this moment, he re-emerges the spell, and the magic that is issued will not surprise them regardless of the power. But never imagined that the magic of Richard, who is a superpower, actually succumbed to himself and then annihilated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Richard too tired to fail magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have passed this idea in their hearts, and suddenly they have a chill! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a superpower, Richard is actually their spiritual pillar. As long as Richard can still fight, the strong and the soldiers will be fearless. Because of the qualities that once existed in Gordon, it is now also on Richard. As the king of Archimonde, they will always fight at the forefront of the front! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No face suddenly exclaimed, cried in consciousness: "No need for this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard said coldly: "If you are all dead, I certainly can't make them so easy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many reapers suddenly slowed down The offensive began to hover involuntarily in the air, as if an invisible hand repeatedly interfered with their activities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred strongman was overjoyed and immediately threw three throwing spears and slammed into three small fighters. Seeing that they are going to hit these small fighters that have lost their maneuverability, but they throw a spear and suddenly miss it. They pass by these fighters and then lose the motivation to move on. They float in the air and are strangely irregular. Rotate up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sanctuary strong man opened his mouth and couldn’t understand why it would be like this. However, those who have already had good eyesight have seen the black lines floating in the place where the three fireballs have just gathered. These black lines slowly swim and outline the shape of a vague sphere in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
