In the world, he has talents, but there are geniuses everywhere in the dark blue. Compared with talent, Richard is more diligent and diligent. He learns and cultivates almost all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, who would like to get Richard’s achievements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Minnie thought about how many times she didn’t know, if she could foresee today, she would not miss this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no Richard, Stevenson is also considered to be excellent, the 16th-level Dragon Warlock, the combat power is much stronger than the common Master, he can Wearing magic armor, indicating that there is potential for excavation, Stevenson is a first-class quasi-constructor, or a good general, but with these, can not let Minnie meet, she always feels that she should get More. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the growth of age, after leaving the college, the shortcomings of Stevenson gradually revealed, the most important thing is actually the children of the big aristocrats He is more and more difficult and hardworking, and he spends more and more time on socializing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Stevenson is a serious pedigree and birth critics. He looks down on those who are born in low spirits. In the army he personally masters, There is almost no possibility for an aristocrat-born officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young people of small aristocrats and even civilians are very sensitive, especially those who have the skills. Minnie understands that these people may not need money status. But they must be given respect and fair opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolute fairness never exists, but at least as fair as other places, but unfortunately, from Stevenson, they always take Not the latter two, so capable civilian officers have tried to get rid of Stevenson's army, and no external officers will come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sevenwinson does not think this is his problem, but blames the shortsightedness of the civilians because of their inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Minnie also saw the ceiling of Stevenson, knowing that he might be like this when he was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Minnie would think of a scene that was ruthlessly rejected by Richard when she was in dark blue. She couldn’t help but think, if then Be determined, be pitiful, or be sincere, and the result will be different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thoughts, she has always been careful in the bottom of my heart, never revealing a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since leaving Deep Blue, whenever he heard Richard’s name, Stevenson would be thunderous, but Richard’s reputation became louder and louder, and his deeds were also Pieces are more than a sensation, and even every time the conference is a big event worth talking about for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also at this stage that Stevenson’s temper is getting worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Stevenson and the generals had a dispute, Minnie secretly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mini, who is involved in too many plane wars, is no longer a mere mage. She quietly studied all the past battles of Richard and then came up with a in conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimondes who have been armed to the teeth are looking at Noland, which is also rare, and when they are personally directed by Richard That battle power has already crowned the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidvinson is ambitious and wants to use the blood of the 100,000 people in his hands. It is best to kill Richard directly on the spot. It is believed that with this well-trained 100,000-strong army, it will not pay 50,000 of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, the 100,000 people will be defeated by the 50,000 Archimonde led by Ellie, not to mention that Richard is leading himself. This Minnie is clear, the generals are also clear, perhaps only Stevenson is determined not to admit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when the army had arrived at the border of Brahms, suddenly received a rush from the Duke of Soram, ordering Stevenson to retreat immediately And within a day of withdrawing two hundred kilometers, Soram led the other two troops to withdraw at the same time. As for the other private officers of the Duke, Soram was not obliged to inform them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't understand why I have to withdraw." Stevenson is not reconciled. It is only 30 kilometers from Brahms. He walks faster and can cross the boundary stone in an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, we can't violate the order of the Duke." The general emphasized it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Withdrawal." Stevenson finally refused to give up the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at this moment, the screaming horns suddenly sounded outside, and the generals all changed, because the horn sounded like an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Stevenson and the generals rushed out of the camp, the ground was already shaking, and the vibrations became more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far horizon, the black line of cháo began to appear, rolling in here, and in the twinkling of an eye, the generals saw the one. Team flags on the volcanic world tree sign of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Archimonde, all the generals are full of stunned, they don’t know if the leader is coming to Richard, if it’s Richard, then they’re still To face a new problem, who will resist Richard, the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the entire military camp was chaotic, the generals woke up in a dream, desperately restored order, and rushed a team of soldiers to the defensive position, but 100,000 It’s so easy to have a whole army of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scouts, what have they done, there is no jǐng report, I want to kill them, I know that these damn people can’t stand it." Sen is still roaring at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Solam’s army barely organized the basic defense, Archimonde’s army had already entered the sprint distance, so the knights began to accelerate, black pressure As the cháo water flooded the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the army of Archimonde, the knight has always been extraordinarily, and there are more than 10,000 knights in the army of more than 20,000 people. When they saw the knights who started to suffocate in the front row, they were shocked at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many knights in the construction of the knight. When the hundred knights are lined up and shoulder-shouldered, the shock can’t be described. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals have long heard that the Archimonde family is now rampant, but only when they see it, will they know the true meaning of the word flood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron hoof is like a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rushing into the kilometer, the builders of the knights throw out spears. In the roaring explosion, the wooden walls of the barracks collapsed. Soldiers with no protection at the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torrent of steel in Archimonde suddenly slammed into the barracks and strangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just half an hour, Soram’s 100,000-strong army showed signs of collapse. Under the repeated trampling of the magical ride, the morale of the soldiers quickly fell to the bottom and hit harder. The appearance of Richard in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t do anything, so it floated in the low air of tens of meters, overlooking the whole war, in addition to Richard in the sky, again No one else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sidvinson army does not lack the Sanctuary Powerhouse and the Great Magister, but now that Richard is in the sky, who dares to take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the battlefield and suddenly saw two familiar people, and his heart moved, instantly falling from the sky like a rock, kneeling on the battlefield. Yāng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, the earth trembled fiercely, the ground at the foot of Richard’s foot quickly collapsed downwards, and a round hole of tens of meters in a circle appeared in the blink of an eye. All the soldiers were turned upside down and fell, and the people close to Richard were simply directly bombarded by the shock wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up straight and looked at the fallen soldiers around him. He couldn’t help but sigh, this time the power is bigger.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a entangled guard, Stevenson finally pushed the warrior who pressed himself, struggling to stand up, just stood up, he suddenly stunned because Richard did not know when he was standing in front of him and looked at him quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked carefully at Stevenson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This former rì in the dark blue period, the biggest competitor is vaguely still has the outline of the old rì, but the appearance has changed a lot, at this moment Richard from his eyes In the middle, I saw anger, jealousy, and deep fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true strength and age of Stevenson is naturally not as good as Richard. Counting the time in the secondary plane, it should be ten years before the dark blue first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a long time, Stevenson’s strength has just reached level 16, and he is still far away from the big magician, and his talent is far more than Therefore, as a Dragon Warlock, if the power of Dragon Blood is fully awakened, he even has a glimmer of hope for the legend, but according to the current entry, Stevenson is no longer hopeful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had been on the same road in the past, even Stevenson was even higher than Richard, now only 10 years have passed, and now hundreds of people in Richard In the life of the year, more than ten years have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current strength of Stevenson suggests that he has not tried his best in the past few years, and that Richard does have opportunities, but these opportunities It is not unique, but he has never slackened, so he has seized almost every opportunity that comes to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around and saw Minnie in the crowd, and the former school sister looked at him at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnie is 16th, but Richard doesn’t think she will not work hard. The deepest impression of this woman is her vigorous ambition, but she failed to Showing my talents shows that she has not been very happy over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Stevenson and Minnie, the dark blue time seems to have returned to Richard’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard recalled the past, many of the surrounding Soram’s warriors and generals struggled to climb, and a few unlucky guys could not afford to hurt. Soram’s warrior faintly surrounded the Licha group, and Stevenson stared at Richard, but did not open the order to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals’ eyes looked from time to time, and many of them were still standing in the pit, as did Stevenson and Minnie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that this huge shallow pit is really terrible. Where Richard is standing, the ground has already fallen more than a meter, so huge impact. Many people are unheard of and have never seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps only the full-scale dive of the legendary dragon will produce such a terrible impact, but Richard is a human being, not a dragon, nor an ancient Titan, he How could it be such a huge pit on the ground, how big is his power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
