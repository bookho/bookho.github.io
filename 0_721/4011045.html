Otherwise, I don't mind sinking all of your fleet. In addition, take me to yours. At the port, I have something important to see your big king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big jīng spirit king is what you can see, let us put it. Otherwise, you will all be executed." The female Druid screamed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled, saying: "Kinsil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kinsley Immediately step forward, whispered in the mouth, shè out a dark gray sè light ball, hit the female Druid body, the female jīng spirit immediately screamed loudly, the whole body was full of light green sè flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mana burning." The three Druids exclaimed, but did not dare to take care of them. They could only watch the female jīng spirit struggle, but they were powerless. Stop the magic of your body from burning bit by bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldsley’s hands rushed back, and the mana flame of the female jīng spirit immediately went out, but now the female jīng spirit is dying, no more strength what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go back, she stays here first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three high jīng Ling finally understood that they were far from the opponent of Richard's shipman. The Druid, who was headed, finally asked: "Where are you from, why do you want to see our big king?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Richard, the Holy Alliance from Noland. As for why I came, I will tell him when I see your big king."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Druids no longer ask, returning to the giant eagle and flying towards the patrol fleet that has already appeared on the sea level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jīng The fleet of the spirit empire finally appeared in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a patrol submarine consisting of seven warships of different sizes. The warships are all blue and blue, with gold sè, and the huge magical sails have a striking jīng empire mark. As long as people who have seen the relevant maps, At first glance, these warships belong to the higher spirits, because they are almost exactly the same as the warships of the great empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard sees it more clearly, from the magical flow of magical sails, you can know that these warships are exactly the same as the design of the spirit age of the empire. Any difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the millennium has passed, the Norland Human Empire has never paid attention to the Navy, but it has slowly developed. The Magical Windsurfing is actually a somewhat backward driving technology. The basic design of Richard's seven warships came from the gray dwarfs, combined with some of the reaper craftsmanship modifications, at least not much better than those who are magical sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How the high-class jīng spirits of the green continent seem to have no progress at all." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk shrugged and said: "From the perspective of these warships, it is indeed like this, maybe their power is not used in this regard. Even if it is a magical warship in the spirit of the empire, it is enough to deal with the people of Noland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is compared with the warship of the gray dwarf, Some are falling behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gray dwarf was beaten by us on the land, and there is still room for invading the green continent, so in fact the high here. The spirits still have hundreds of years of stability, if you are not here." The eagle's words are somewhat ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said: "Not that I will be someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fleet The attack formation has already been set up, and the patrol fleet opposite is cautiously afraid to approach, but circled around the fleet of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher jīngling The entire patrol submarine warships are together, not as big as the tonnage of a magical warship. In this case, dare to approach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several giant eagle flew up from the patrol fleet, and two high-class jīng spirits also took off, flew to Richard’s fleet and landed on the flagship deck. Seeing the female jīng Ling Druid who couldn’t get up on the deck, the two high-ranking jīng spirits suddenly flashed their anger, but when they glanced over the people on the deck, they suddenly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawks and splashes have the power of legendary powerhouses, and at least 16 fighters are busy on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the standing position is obviously the leader of the Richard, the two high-level jīng Ling is somewhat confused, they can not see the strength of Richard, but also want I don't understand how a person without power can become the leader of such a terrible fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are the thirteenth patrol sub-fleet of the jīng spirit empire, you are from Noland, why do you want to see the big jīng spirit king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawks stepped forward and handed over a sealed national book, saying: "We are the messengers from the Millennium Empire, and we also ask to see the King of the King. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Millennium Empire." The faces of the two high-level jīng spirits were slightly gentler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Millennium Empire has always had a relationship with the higher spirits of the Cangqing Continent. The blood of the imperial royal family actually contains the blood of a great prince. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking jīng spirit headed by the head said: "We will transfer this book to our superiors as soon as possible. Please stop at this anchorage and wait for the notice, no matter how big. Ling Wang will not accept you, I will return as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Goshawk frowned slightly and said: "We are coming across the ocean, and now we need urgent supply. In addition, it is still far away from the green continent. It is also very dangerous for us to park on the ocean. It is the season of frequent storms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher jīngling Persevere: "The territorial sea of ​​the spiritual empire here, you must abide by our regulations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk said: "How can I not remember that the jīng spirit empire has such a It is stipulated that our fleet was parked directly in the port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher jīng sneer, pointed to Richard and said: "But he is humiliated. My subordinates must pay the price, this is a punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only faint at this time Said: <br /> <br /> & nbsp "mere sanctuary, but added tone is not small."; & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Higher jīng spirit step forward, cold road: "I am behind the jīng spirit empire, how dare you, you guys, sloppy, dirty and stupid humans, together with the orcs and dwarves, used yīn to grab the Nolan De, but now it is a green continent, so that you are close to the coastline, it will tarnish our beautiful land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: "Sure enough is high The arrogance of jīng spirit, this time I am planning to use a tender branch of the Golden World tree for something. If you change your mind because of your rudeness, can you afford it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher jīng's face changed aloud, and shouted: "The twig of the golden world tree, how can this treasure appear on your hand."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not what you should know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ask to take a look."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not what you should see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high-class jīng spirit bites , "Well, you keep up with my fleet, I will take you to the nearest port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two high-class jīng spirit brought the woman jīng Ling Druid, returned to the patrol sub-fleet, then the entire fleet changed direction, heading toward the Cangqing continent, and Richard's fleet also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think these jīng spirits will be so smooth for us to see the great king." Goshawk said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "It’s normal. I didn’t intend to get what I wanted from the normal way, because through normal channels, these jīng The spirits will never give them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard looked at the jīng spirit sub-fleet in front and said, "First follow them. It takes less than a day. It is estimated that we have to fight a sea battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Goshawk knocked on the ship's side and said, "I really want to see how powerful the warships you have modified with Reaper technology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is definitely no warship for the Reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the endless ocean, the two fleets sprinted toward the Cangqing continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the jīng spirit patrol sub-fleet all the magical sails are full of wind, a warship winds and waves, cut the waves of the sea, but meters Na looked at it with a look of disdain. She said to the goshawk: "Brother, this is the fleet of the spirit empire, have they used full speed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Goshawk looked at the main sail of the front of the jīng spirit warship and said, "It should already be full speed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina suddenly surprised: "This is full speed." Even half of our true speed is not there. The fleet of the jīng spirit empire is really weak enough. I really don’t understand why our Millennium Empire is so polite to them.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; The eagle smirked and said: "It is not that the fleet of the spirit empire is too weak, but the fleet of Richard is too strong. The ship you are sitting on has been rebuilt using the technology of the reaper, and How can a general warship be the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mina’s eyes are shining, I don’t know what’s in my heart. What is the idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawks have no choice but to shake their heads, and they have nothing to do with their sister, but he does not intend to interfere with anything. Mina does not follow the common sense style, maybe it’s true. Being able to catch Richard, as for the mountains and the sea, the Goshawk is actually not sure what kind of state she is in with her mother nest. She is a mountain and a sea, a parent nest, or something else. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t want to be pinned on the mountains and the sea, then the Goshawk still hopes that there will be someone in his own side of the woman, Richard. I am very old-fashioned. In this case, no matter what happens in the future, the Millennium Empire will always be able to retreat more and have more room for manoeuvre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the jīng spirit patrol sub-fleet is desperately accelerating, but the power that the magical sail can provide has reached the extreme, and then want to accelerate, you can only rely on the fleet command The maritime technology of the official, but the speed of the commander of the savvy is extremely limited. The speed of more than 50 kilometers is now super-level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
