			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less than a quarter of the opponent’s strength, The highland unicorns of the Viscounts, the pioneer Knight Licha immediately had a small reputation in the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days, hundreds of hired workers and dozens of car wood stones arrived in Richard’s territory. They all came from the land of Baron Fontaine. As part of the ransom of the Count of Him, the Baron Xiaofang Dan was obliged to provide the necessary supplies to Richard at a low price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the baron leader immediately sent the material without any objection after receiving the letter from Richard, confirming Richard’s previous conjecture, the baron collar The decisive figure who fell to the Duke of Glasgow was Viscount Heim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After understanding this fact, Richard has slightly raised the price of the strategic decision of the Viscounts, and can think of the geographical location of the territory while resorting to force. The special baron of the small Fang Dan, to block the direct passage between Richard and the Duke of the Wolf, prevented the Duke from intervening in advance, and intercepted the back of Richard, and was considered a qualified adviser. But it is only qualified, because it is so great that it won't win, and loses it will be a heavy loss. Therefore, these advisers have a tactical vision, but they have no strategic awareness at all. Of course, another possibility is that they do have a strategic sense, but they can't play at the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, no matter which side Baron Xiaofang Dan is standing on, the Duke of Glasgow or the Duke of the Wolf, they have to temporarily become the logistics of Richard. base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the workers and materials were in place, Richard’s castle finally started. Every few days, Richard went to the construction site to inspect the progress of the project, and occasionally modified the drawings of the castle. In the next four months, the prototype of the castle can be built, and then the interior decoration will be carried out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for the castle to be fully completed, Richard sent several representatives of the messengers to prepare to turn the gold coins in his hands into combat power as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the list of purchases made by Baron Xiaofang Dan, in addition to wood and stone, it also includes a large number of food and sophisticated weapons. Originally Baron Xiaofang Dan did not want to provide weapons, but Richard also classified the deal as part of the ransom of the Viscount, so the supply and demand relationship between the two sides was immediately reversed. The Baron does not only need to provide the standard equipment of two hundred elite infantry at a low price, but the quality must also be guaranteed to be optimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way is to go to the Blue Water Oasis, where there are many old friends of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few days, the person sent by Richard sent the latest news of the bloody land. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although several major oases have suffered heavy losses after being stormed by Sinclair, it is also a loss of manpower, and large areas of land and buildings are still intact. Sinclair died in a moment and died under the dusk castle. When she died, the forces that had succumbed to her arrogance immediately resumed their true colors and regained the oasis. However, the losses of the various parties are not the same, and some are almost unscathed, while others are seriously hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original balance of the situation has been broken, the forces of all parties have re-divided the requirements of the interests of the pattern, the situation of several oasis in the bloody land is a thousand, There is a possibility of a melee at any time. The various human countries bordering the blood-stained land are also eyeing this huge interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the prices of slaves, weapons, magic crystals, and alchemy equipment skyrocketed, while the prices of minerals, raw materials, and other rare materials declined. . For example, Richard originally wanted to hire a group of horses to guard the territory, but found that the price of the horse has far exceeded his budget. The rise in cannon ash prices is also an important sign that the war will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
