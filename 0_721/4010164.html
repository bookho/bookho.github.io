			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Richard’s meditation was interrupted. The attendant told Richard that several nobles had rushed over and asked Li to dispose of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is somewhat surprised, and does not understand why the cold and solitary character of Shuihua has provoked these nobles. So Richard came to the living room and saw that the eleven nobles were crowded in the hall. The small living room was crowded, and even the seats were not enough. Several people even had to stand. Fortunately, they also understood the basic etiquette and awe, and gave the sofa of the main seat to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also welcome, went straight to the sofa, sat down, and then said to a waiter: "Go and call Gangde and the water flower!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendant is destined to go. In fact, Richard does not need a waiter at all, as long as he greets him in consciousness. However, Richard does not intend to let these nobles know their own cards. Now, Richard’s vision of them has brought a trace of misery. For Richard, it is really an hour that is equivalent to thousands of gold coins. His time is precious, and it is not something that these people can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha leaned forward and held his chin in one hand, listening carefully to the complaints and demands of these nobles. He looks serious, but his posture has an undisguised domineering. In this kind of gaze, the aristocrats with a lot of emotions involuntarily swallowed some direct complaints about Richard, and only poured a grievance on the water flower, so Richard's face became more and more gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of eleven people come and go, from time to time mixed with impassioned complaints, declarations, statements and claims. Of course, the key parts of the facts must be indispensable for distortion and exaggeration. The more they talked, the more excited they were, especially the Viscount Ambrose, who was headed, and even more eager to jump on the coffee table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even for a duke, the Sanctuary is a strong object that needs to be tempted to win. The man who died last night under the splash was the guard of the Viscount Ambrose, but it was actually the guard that his father, the Marquis of Albrech, temporarily sent to him for his safety. Now a Sanctuary strongman inexplicably died in the blue water oasis, and the Viscount could not explain it after returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the water splashed into the living room quietly, the temperature inside the hall dropped by several degrees. The girl has recognized all the nobles who had been released last night, and her eyes turned cold, and the hand was on the handle of the guide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of these nobles was instantly half-time, and they remembered that this girl was Richard. Being able to kill the sanctuary is so stunning, and the relationship with Richard is definitely not ordinary. Thinking of this layer, their arrogance immediately disappeared again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the brain is not broken, you will not want to be an enemy of Richard. Originally, their original intention is to discuss it. By the way, see if it can Get some benefits, after all, the life of a sanctuary still has some value. Only the Count of Amboise was difficult to ride on the tiger, and he had to hold on to it. No matter what the outcome of the negotiation, he had to put on a tough stance, mainly to see his friends and the cronies of the father hidden in the followers, hoping to alleviate one’s own responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening for a while, Richard raised his hand and immediately quieted down in the living room. Everyone was quietly waiting for him to say something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to talk, everyone else will be quiet, this is called authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a faint smile on his face, Li said: "I generally understood that you have had a little more drink in the evening and met her. You didn't recognize her, just made a few jokes. I didn't expect her to suddenly Do you kill one of your sanctuary guards. Is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Ambosia hesitated, or nodded: "About so "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly laughed a few times and smiled and said: "You guys, stupid kid, dare to joke with my woman! A submarine sanctuary However, if you kill it, you will kill it. What's the big deal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abu Dhabi and other nobles suddenly stunned, the Sanctuary Strong is 'What's the big deal? of'? Viscount Ambosi finally recovered from the shock and said, "I don't think so, Master Richard! That's the Sanctuary! You have to give us a confession..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That? Do you dare to confess?" Richard's smile gradually became less sunny, and even began to be a bit cold: "You guys and my woman are joking, isn't it? Are you impatient?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the joke very heavy and immediately let the nobles know his attitude and understand that Richard I don't intend to accept their shoddy claims. Looking at it from another angle, it is that Richard did not put their status in the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobleman looked at the situation and tried to ease the atmosphere. He quickly said with a smile: "Mr. Richard! It’s just a woman, and Ambo Western Viscount..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard raised his hand again, and the nobleman immediately shut up. Richard said faintly: "Okay, such a small thing has already wasted a lot of my time, so far. I will not pursue this matter, the next time it is not as simple as a escort. Here is the blue water. Oasis, it is my site, you better recognize my people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Ambrose has a red face and anger: "Li Check! You are too mad! This is the end of the matter? If you bear the consequences, let's see if this is really the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard looked at the Viscount of Amboise and said, "Your father is the Marquis of Orbeck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly!" The Viscount raised his head and at the same time Take a sigh of relief. This Richard finally remembered his background. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Viscounts of Amboisi did not expect that Richard swayed his flat wave, as if he was driving a fly, and said: "Yes! If Orblake disagrees, even if the army is sent, we will have a good fight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Ambrose is stunned, he did not expect Richard to actually The opening is going to be snoring, and it is still a very unsatisfactory look. The original result is not to apologize to Richard, and then to compensate? Although he would still be blamed by his father, he was finally given the result of a face and rules of the nobility. Although he is awkward, he is not particularly stupid. Since the water flower can kill the sanctuary, the strength is not close to the sanctuary. It is impossible to let Richard hand over her, even if it is a position. Change, he will not agree. But Orbeck’s sanctuary guards can’t be white, apologize and monetary compensation. The Viscount Amboise thinks it is the minimum requirement for resolving disputes. Who knows that Richard’s attitude is even if it’s tough and bad, and he’s not talking about it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Viscount Ambosi had to support the scene and pointed to Richard’s wickedness: "Good, very good! You are waiting! I will unite with others." A noble glory, come together to crusade you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said: "If you dare to point me to speak, then I will cut your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambus The Viscount was furious and angry, but he did not dare to use his fingers to look at Richard. He snorted heavily and turned and walked away, but he didn't even dare to fall off the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the departure of Viscount Ambrose, Richard shook his head helplessly and said to the nobles who remained in the room: "What do you say about me?" Can people learn to respect me? Do you want to kill a few more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrats swept by Richard’s eyes all have a cold sweat, they immediately Chada praised, said that the vertical line plan is magnificent and magnificent, and Richard is a new generation of war gods in the kingdom. It has long been famous and no need to kill people. And when Richard smiled and asked a question, ‘Yes? After that, they all realized the enlightenment, so they immediately came out with a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Li saw that the beat was already on fire, he blew all these nobles out. Then I turned around and looked at the water and Gangde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the water flower has long been low, suddenly gritted his teeth, exhausted his whole body and squeezed out: "I'm sorry."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Richard could hardly believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the water flower is hanging down, that is, refused to lift it up, and will not let Richard see her face. Li suddenly understood what she said in her words, so she laughed and said, "Are you talking about last night? It doesn't matter, don't be afraid to trouble me, and then run into similar things, even those nobles can Kill a few! Don't be afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Richard sighed again and said, "Some want to take a trip!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also! Now the bones of the whole body are itching." Gangde has the same feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked back and forth in the living room for a few laps before he said, "Now is not the best time to start a war. Just bear it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Gangde and Shuihua left the living room of Richard in tandem. After walking out of the building, Gangde stopped and just wanted to say something. As a result, he ran into his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! How do you seem to wake up?" Gangde snorted and snorted. The power of a girl is not a general big, unconscious collision, the power is comparable to the blow of the Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!" The girl’s expression was lying at first glance. She did not wait for Gangde to speak, and she turned and walked away like a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was stunned and grabbed his head. He said to himself with a blank voice: "I don’t want to ask you to find a couple of horses to open." Open up, why do you run so fast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who is already in the distance is jumping hard, just thinking: "He said that I am his Woman...this, what does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another month in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first caravan to the Dwarf Empire successfully returned and brought back huge benefits. The proceeds of more than three million gold coins made everyone crazy, and Richard took a quarter of the goods. He does not need gold coins, as long as the ore and metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
