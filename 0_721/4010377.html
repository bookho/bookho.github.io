Courage, now, Richard also has the courage to do something, but no longer need to rely on the fate of the crystal plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, it was completely overwhelmed by the shadow creatures. From afar, a huge shadow between the heavens and the earth horrified in fear, as if it had an independent will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the next moment, there was a roaring roar like a tsunami over the ice floes. It was a roar of anger at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow was suddenly pierced by dozens of powerful white light columns. At the beginning, it was full of fire, turned into a meteor, whistling and hitting the portal. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A roar, the fire broke through the portal of the Shadow Legion, a fireball suddenly appeared in the sky above the dark blue, and then expanded silently, instantly changing Into a huge fireball with a diameter of 10,000 meters, the aftermath of the fire wave cut the top of the dark blue tower a few centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision makes everyone who sees it shudder, this is the horror power that makes people unable to resist or even escape, but away from the dark blue The people in it are so close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is not hot, and even some cold, but the power of its invasion is ten times that of ordinary fire, but before the flame broke out, The magic shield was suddenly placed on Richard's body. This shield was unexpectedly tough, and it never broke under the repeated flames. The inside of Richard also saved his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devastating fire wave has finally passed, and the body stretched into a group of bodies at the beginning, and the face is blue and green, and the near-colorless eyes are even more angry. The robes on his body have long since disappeared. There are scars everywhere. Almost no skin is intact. There are also traces of melting on the surface of the body's natural armor. It is obviously unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no end to the battle. At the top of the dark blue tower, there are still some shadow creatures that survived the destruction. There is no doubt that these are far More powerful than the same kind of guy, he screamed a few swearing anger at the beginning, and rushed to the remaining shadow creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the battle was finally over. At the beginning of the day, I didn’t know how many wounds, wounded and wounded, and there were countless haunting shadows in the wound, and I was struggling with the power of the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bloody flesh of the wound, it can be seen that the self-healing ability of the beginning is extremely strong, but even so, it can only maintain the wound without deterioration, and can not make the injury better. However, he was hurt by multiple injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the moment, the breath is extremely weak, the smoke formed by the shadows on the body, like the ruins burned by the fire, but the natural strong man The momentum has not weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big magisters appeared on the rooftop one by one, and their eyes looked at the beginning in a complicated way. Some of them seemed to have the intention to do it, but hesitated and did not know. Should not be shot, such as the beginning of the talent and blood is extremely powerful legendary strong, even if the magic is exhausted, it may still be horrible lethal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of the cold, I swept away a few sneaky big magisters and immediately made them extremely unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he snorted and ignored them. Instead, he went to Richard and reached into the tough magic shield to catch Lee. Inspecting the neck, raising his life, then angered: "You are crazy," <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee closes his eyes and does not say a word . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You thought I didn't dare to kill you," he said at the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still silent, and there is no trace of muscle on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the face changed a few times, snorted, and dropped Richard on the ground, and let his face touch the ground first, when Richard swayed and climbed up. The face was full of blood, and a big hole was opened on the forehead, and the bridge of the nose broke open. Richard wiped his face and even broke into the blood of his eyes. He stood straight in front of the beginning and looked at it indifferently. Looking at him, still not talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he brought up Richard and squatted on the ground. Richard then climbed up again, and the blood on his face was more. When Richard stood up, At the beginning, he put him on the ground again, if it was repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind whistled and the dark blue blew from the sky, and sent the snoring snoring to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A two-legged flying dragon takes off from the deep blue and flies in the direction of Faust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is on the back of the Wyvern, using his strength to hug the body of the dragon, so that he can not be shackled, the wind at high altitude is very cold. Blowing on Richard's body, so that his numerous wounds are like a knife-cutting pain. Richard's hands and feet have long lost consciousness. He is completely instinctively holding the dragon. His body is frozen and stiff, but his face is burning. It hurts, blood is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an unprecedented shame, and it was a humiliation that had never been imagined. Richard’s consciousness repeatedly echoed the words of the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are quite a bit sturdy, but now what is the use of bone gas, it is not for me to add some fun."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too weak, I want to fall and fall, you want to kick and kick you, what can you do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the teacher's students, only you have the worst talent, and now your strength is also the worst."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deep blue really has a strong enemy, just rely on you I want to save the teacher. You are dead ten times and eight times. Can you change the result? I want to die with it. You can do it. Don’t think too much about yourself. You are sacrificed, but you are something, sacrifice. There is a fart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't understand what the teacher is looking at you, is it a beautiful face, you see, I am stepping on your face, you are again How can you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still laughing, thinking that this is bloody, but do you have the ability to fight back? If not, you will only laugh. Let me feel 贱"<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a sentence, and repeatedly ears in Richard, became the only voice of the world completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between dizziness, severe pain and embarrassment, Richard found that what he had always believed in was beginning to waver. He firmly believed in courage, firmly believed in the will, and firmly believed in perseverance. But these seem to be totally worthless in the mouth of the beginning, and in the face of the overwhelming power of the beginning, any will becomes a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard didn't know, what should he do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the confusion, Richard instinctively thought, if it was the man, what would he do, in the middle of it, Richard seemed to see it again. Gordon stood in front of him. The man also had a short beard. He was stroking the short beard on his chin in the same position. He seemed to hear the question of Richard, and he burst into laughter: "I will take the guy's jealousy." They all came out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing such a hegemonic sentence, Richard couldn’t help but boil, but he immediately thought of a problem, if he could not beat the beginning of the ceremony. Then what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bad boy, this is your problem, think about why you are so useless, you Laozi, I have never been so uninterested." Do not disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the strengths are really too big, so big that they can’t make up for it... and, only the will, the courage and the perseverance, isn’t it really enough? miss you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guy said it must be right, we are Archimonde, it’s never a shame to fight death, you must stand every time you fight." At the forefront, if this is not possible, what is the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Richard is waking up, why is it true that it is right at first? I did not hurt him the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about this, Richard felt awakened a lot. He tried to open his eyes and look forward, but there was only a deep night in the field of vision. Starry sky, only the huge head of the two-legged dragon, but there is the figure of the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei tried to open his eyes and look into the depths of the night, and he found nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He realized that the man had finally gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in the future, Richard will find his traces, but that is to be in the deepest part of the world, and Richard does not even know that the power of the Era is now Can you reach the deepest part of the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Gotton is gone, he can also guide Richard’s direction in this way. Whenever he is confused, Richard always thinks that the man is here. In what kind of circumstances, I will do it. Unconsciously, Richard has kept short hair and learned the habitual movements of Gordon, but he still does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Richard had a little understanding of some of Elaine’s thoughts. Richard had already learned what happened to the Yongyue Forest that year, and knew why Ilani would hate Gordon so much that he would rather die than die. Seeing him, now, Richard has touched the other side of his mother's heart. Why is she always so proud when she talks about her father every time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wyvern is flying in the night, flying farther and farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the top of the dark blue, the first time standing alone, the lead cloud is now not far from his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the direction of Richard’s far away, and for a long time, he sighed heavily and said to himself: "Teacher, is this the person you like?" , how to say it, really good, huh, huh..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, standing still there, not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is waiting for the enemy of Su Helun, he knows that they should come soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the secret law prohibition of the teacher’s bedroom can be isolated for a while, but over time, first of all these students who have inherited the deep blue meditation, will In the resonance of the rules, I heard the teacher’s sleeping information, and then the teacher’s enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid vain ruined the endless illusion of the "Mirror of Vientiane" because of private thoughts, so everything was advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become an enemy of Su Helun. By contrast, the former Shadow Super Legion is a piece of cake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this war, I knew at the beginning that my ending was mostly, but he didn’t care. In fact, among Su Hailun’s students, it’s not just Richard’s innocence. fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even a little grateful that before entering the past, there is no idea that he can’t think of it now, and he has got a coordinate in the dark blue. It was completely superfluous at that time. He stepped into the unconventional situation, the source of retrospective time, the beginning of the blood, his own self, and all the past was just interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now he seems to understand the meaning of all this, the original is to come back to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
