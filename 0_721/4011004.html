			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger carried three people flying high and rushed to the next battlefield at full speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way, Richard also met several small-scale reapers. However, Richard is not interested in spending time on them, but instead rushes to the core battlefield. When Richard arrived, the situation on this battlefield was already in jeopardy. Three legendary strongmen were seriously injured and the Sanctuary suffered more than half. After a hard fight, Richard finally eliminated the reapers here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are fourth and fifth battlefields, but they are no longer going. Before he set off, Richard received the news that the two battlefields dominated by the coalitions of the various countries of the country had fallen, and the army was completely annihilated. Even the hundreds of squadrons that Richard sent to support were not spared. Only a small number of strong people escaped and were coming to the turbulent land where Richard was located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reapers of these two battlefields are continuing to deepen, and all of Richard’s troops are exhausted, at least one day before they can catch up and eliminate these harvests. By. Before that, the people on the road of the reapers marched on their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most unexpected thing for Richard is the attack and defense of the Cold Iron Throne. Surrounded by layers of superior enemies, Saranwell commanded dripping, and repeatedly counterattacked, and successfully managed to hold the Throne of the Cold Iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a very good news, because Richard’s support for Salenwell was not too much. However, when Richard knew the specific process of the battle, he was completely unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville gave up all the perimeter defenses and contracted all the troops into the city. He gave all the fighters over ten, and each sent a strange device. This device is the invention of Salenwell, which looks like a bucket that can be held by hand. There are three reaper's power metal in each drum, and there is a magic array responsible for detonation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war began, massive reapers poured into the cold iron throne. The complex terrain within the city forced the reapers to spread out and then entered the brutal street fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors who got the explosive device waited for the high-end reaper land unit, such as the spider warrior and the mechanical war elephant, and put the device that was sent down to the harvest. On the body, then activate the magic array. When the magical array in the drum is activated, the power metal is strongly stimulated, causing a violent explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosive power of these explosive devices is that the mechanical warfare will be blown up three or five times and will become scrap iron. A spider warrior only needs one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the power of the explosion is huge, which means that the soldiers who rushed to the explosive device will also be broken in the explosion. They are completely fighting their reapers with their flesh and blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle with the Reapers is always a long-term casualty, so Sharonville sighs and makes these destined warriors carry powerful explosive devices. Go with the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they didn’t blow up the high-value goal, even if they were to drop a flesh-and-blood warrior, they would have earned it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the frontal battlefield, these 10th-level junior knights have the same combat power as a flesh-and-blood warrior. In the actual battle, due to the rigorous tactical planning of the reapers, the actual combat power must exceed the strength of the human army at the same level. In the open field and the reapers, human beings are always at a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is a turbulent place in the Western battlefield where Richard is commanding, the reaper does not fall into the wind, if it is not a faceless takeover of the important local battlefield, harvesting They even have the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard’s messenger flew over the throne of the Cold Iron, he saw that it was no longer the majestic Northern Fortress in memory, but only a hundred square feet. Kilometers of ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are traces of violent explosions everywhere, and many buildings with a long history have only half of them left. In the ruins, people work like ants. They will clean up the bodies of the victims and drag the reapers of the reapers to the designated squares. They will also dig up the food and blankets in the ruins, otherwise they will only die on cold nights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are old people, women, and children in the crowd. Even children as young as five or six are helping to clean up the ruins. Not many people cry, time is too precious, the reaper does not know when it will come again, people have to survive, there is no time to cry, even if the hand is dragging the body of a loved one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many war dead have long since disappeared in the blast, and the reaper's hard metal skeleton can be preserved. However, the bodies of the imperial soldiers who were cleared from the ruins still piled up hills in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also traces of three abattoirs outside the city, but only a piece of ground that has been soaked with blood. The reapers lost their battles. They put all the combat units into battle, and the transport ship carried the full flesh and blood cargo blocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the abattoir, there was not even a little larger piece of meat on the ground soaked with blood. This shows the ruthlessness and efficiency of the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Cold Iron Throne, some surviving warriors are pouring barrels of fire oil on the corpses, and the rafts have long been built. When the wizards threw a fireball into the corpse, the fire immediately ignited and gradually swallowed the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, someone can't help but cry. All the bodies are not allowed to be buried, but must be burned. It is now known that the reapers will use their bodies as raw materials to produce more killing units to kill their families, so no one is opposed to burning the bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they didn’t leave much time for them to grieve. It didn’t take long for people to start shouting and lead people to clean up the new ruins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly found Saranwell, the imperial emperor at the moment carrying the reaper of the reaper in the ruins like an ordinary person. There are several Masters busy in the piles of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They carefully picked out the power metal in the wreck and placed it in their pockets. Power metal has a strong radiation, and it will be permanently damaged by being placed around for a long time. These wizards can't be ignorant of this truth, but they are not willing to take a few more steps to put the power metal into the magic box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many wrecks, and it may take half a month to clean up all the wreckage with the number of these wizards. But how many times have you left them to work slowly? These power metals are the key to the next war, so all the wizards are working the same crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already landed in the square, but the busy wizards have no one to look up to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountain and sea suddenly said: "These things have radiation, why not put them in the magic box?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a middle-aged mage looked up at the mountain and the sea, and then said faintly: "Little guy, can we survive the next battle? I don't know what it is. What is the radiation? Come out, how are the battles in the end, all dead, and still have no value to die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain and the sea mouth open Zhang, can't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that she just woke up and was very confused about a lot of things, so patted her head and took her to the other side of the square. Will walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville threw the reaper in his hand onto the wreckage before he came to Richard and said with a smile: "I didn't expect that I would play here." Win it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I did not expect that the number of reapers was much higher than I had expected.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville sighed and asked: "How is the situation on other battlefields?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 4 and Battlefield 5 The army was annihilated, and only some of the strong men escaped. The other three battlefields were held, but they were also victorious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, our military loss is half ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and said, "Two-thirds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The pressure you should be the biggest. How many reapers are there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably three times here."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenwell sighed, then sighed and said: "Crimson There should be no more left in the team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "The main army has lost 80%. The next step is to adjust the second line and even the garrison. In addition, I am going to recruit troops from the southern countries, and mobilize all their elite troops to deep red and enrich the defensive power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kings are not I will agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still have a little time. Which kingdom dares to disagree, I will send people to kill their royal family." Li said The tone of the Tuyu-King’s family is like killing a few sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
