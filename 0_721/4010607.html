In the twinkling of an eye, there was a long story. When he looked at the cold winter, he had to say something. Achilles had to interrupt him: "No. Talking indiscriminately, Master Richard has come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say, that little bastard is coming." Han Erdong did not react, forgot. Changed the name, he forced to open a slightly better left eye, left and right to see, and really saw Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris coughed twice and said, "I was rescued by Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said: "It is still Achilles's contribution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris shook his head and said: "No, my The Dark Holy Scriptures have not been used a few times. Without the timely help of Master Richard, your injury will definitely leave behind the sequelae."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris is Dark theologian, but from the content of his magic, Richard is more skeptical that he is a blasphemy, no matter what, Achilles is not as good at treating as a true priest, and Richard’s faithful prayer However, there is no hard consumption. When the monthly force is restored, it can be repeatedly released. If you want to completely cure the cold winter, you will rely on Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterer stared at Richard, and then said with a bit of anger: "Hell, you should have heard those words just now... hear it and hear it." That's it, so look at it. In front of your eyes, there is a valley of gold. The people you see are the only soldiers we have left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What; what Richard saw was a land that was quite desolate. The deep gullies on the ground were criss-crossed, dividing the earth into countless pieces, each piece undulating in high ground, like root cutting. A huge pinnacle, patchwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the plane and the forward base are built on a stone peak. There are suspension bridges between the peaks. The cracks on the earth are mostly not wide, only dozens Around the meter, the elite knights can rush through, and the giants that Richard just saw are even less obstructive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The base city was full of squalor, the city wall was destroyed, and several blocks in the city were burning. A crumbling arrow tower could not support it. The roaring fell, and a team of soldiers were cleaning up the battlefield and fighting the dead. The bodies were moved together, but the bodies of many of the soldiers were completely shackled together. They couldn’t be separated. They were carried out with pieces of flesh-and-blood steel cake. Li looked at them and saw only a few hundred soldiers. In the battle with the three giants, nearly a hundred people died in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked around and saw two eyes with a plate size not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a winter meeting, and some self-deprecatingly said: "In order to steal these two things, the result was almost lost."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterer said it was easy, but the injury was betrayed him, and Richard just saw the battle, if it wasn’t for the most powerful giant I am afraid that the casualties of the soldiers will be two or three hundred more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axiris said at this time: "Lectarian, it seems that the base will take a while to clear it out. I still have some time to take you. Going to see the Valley of the Golden Valley is also the origin of the name of the plane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Valley is located at the rear of the base, which is a few hundred meters wide The huge rift deep in the kilometer, the main rift stretches for hundreds of kilometers, and the ends of the two ends are completely invisible. At the same time, there are dozens of large and small cracks and rift valleys connected. The terrain is extremely complicated, and several torrents are from the branch cracks. The rushing came, but it merged into several deep cracks in the Great Rift Valley, and it disappeared, but the roar of the rapids shook people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before standing in the Great Rift Valley, the giants that Richard just saw are extremely small, and humans are even worse than ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent gust of wind slammed from the depths of the Rift Valley, and the Richards swayed gently, but Richard immediately felt the wind coming from the bottom of the valley. Incomparably rich in magical flavor, such a strong magic, he only saw it in the magic crystal mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is." Li looked to Achilles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to wait for Achilles to answer, Han Erdong has jumped directly into the Rift Valley, and disappeared into the misty clouds in a blink of an eye. After a while, Han Erdong Like the most agile mountain, he quickly climbed up the cliff and handed a stone in his hand to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a black ore, and the broken corner revealed the crystal inside. Holding the original ore, it was so rich that it was like a real magical breath. Richard immediately recognized what the original mine was, and was surprised: "Magic crystal ore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Han Dong nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic crystal is contained in the natural magic crystal. In Noland, the magic crystal is the fuel that makes the whole magic civilization run smoothly, such a magic crystal ore. The magic crystal contained in it is worth thousands of gold coins. What surprised Li is not how valuable the magic crystal ore is. Instead, he walked around the rift in the winter and grabbed a high-grade ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The following is the magic crystal of the open air." Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Semi-open-air bar, the original ore scattered like this is everywhere below, but the outcrop of the vein is only a short paragraph, still need some manpower mining, as for reserves, Clear, anyway, a lot." Han Erdong said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still sucks in a cold air. Even so, the value of this vein is too large to be estimated. If the bottom of the valley can be used to pick up the original mine, then this road It is even possible for the veins to spread throughout the rift. The reserves are so large that it is hard to imagine. It is no wonder that this huge rift is named as the Golden Valley. It is indeed a real name. Once it is successfully developed, it is completely a valley of gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the rift again, but did not see any mining facilities, even a few ropes on the mountain wall, he frowned and asked: " Since there is a magic crystal ore, why not develop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asiris smiled and pointed at the burning base, saying: "The enemy When I arrived at home, how did I develop it? When Gordon’s adult decided to lay down the plane, he concentrated his troops to thoroughly sweep the monsters and enemies around the base of the Golden Valley, but no one thought that the adults went to the place. Nothing came back again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and pressed the shadow of the man in his heart, then asked: "The war here has already So critical, why don't you tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterer's face moved, but did not speak, or Asirian said: "There are two One reason is that the Gordon adults originally delivered the Golden Valley to us. As a result, the situation of the plane has gone from bad to worse. I hope to stabilize the situation and return a stable Jinjin Valley at the right time. But if I am not there, it is very difficult to support the situation by only one person. The second reason is that we also want to wait and see, you It is the son of Gordon, but the children of Gordon are not just one of you. Similarly, Count Goliath also has the right to inherit the Archimonde family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Li asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing." Achilles said very calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "I think there is another reason. You want to see if I am worthy to follow, or at least prove that I have let you work." The ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Han Erdong also smiled and said: "There is almost the same thing, mainly to look pleasing to the eye."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you see me pleasing to the eye." Richard asked very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterer smiles and says, "I don't like to be handsomer than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Axiris said: "General Richard, has been cleaned up almost, let's go to the city first, I will explain to you in detail about the situation in the valley."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, so he walked to the commanding castle in the center of the base, surrounded by the cold winter and Asiris. The gate of the castle was already lifted, but at the time of entering the gate Han Erdong and Licha had a very accidental flip, and Richard suddenly felt that the magical pen in his arms had jumped slightly and had to leave on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee does not think about it, step forward, the magical armed forces and the various peoples of the world are fully active, one step is already ten meters away, but Richard’s face is condensed. The artifact magic pen didn't know when it actually flew out of the pocket and floated in the air. If it wasn't that Richard's perception was extremely sensitive, he wouldn't find that the magic pen had gone away. Richard suddenly turned around and saw the cold. Winter followed behind him, his fingers volleyed, and the magic pen flew into his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hand shows that Han Erdong’s control of vindictiveness is already fascinating, and he is looming in Richard’s perception, and the convergence of breath is almost The level of legendary thieves, if not the perceived ability of Richard is invincible under the legend, simply can not detect the action of Han Erdong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that this is the "inspection" of Han Erdong on his own, and seeing that the magic pen is about to fall into the hands of Han Erdong, Richard immediately Pulling out the moonlight, a knife like electricity, has crossed the magic pen, stabbed the nose of the cold winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pieces of matt dagger quietly jumped into the hands of Han Erdong, and then gently swayed on the blade, the moonlight suddenly flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
