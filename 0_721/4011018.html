			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the East and South, there are at least five Reaper detachments at the event They are terrible and efficient. Each team can make hundreds of thousands of people in a day of meat and meat. They are sweeping the human kingdom of the East and the South. Once completed, the entire Faro will have only the Dark Red Kingdom. Less than 10 million people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is innocent for the loss of Wang Du, to solve the battle here, he is more concerned about the battle of the turbulent land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in the turbulent land was unexpectedly good, the mother’s nest personally participated in the battle, the mountain and the sea also fought in the turbulent land, and the mother’s nest independently developed this time. It is considered to be the best combat unit. These combat units are all grotesque bugs, but their combat power is far beyond that of human soldiers of the same class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only 16 large-scale bugs on the battlefield. After they are put on the battlefield, they are able to catch up with the knights and some flying combat units with flying capabilities. It can be singled out with the reaper's small fighter and has the upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many reapers in the offensive turmoil, they are more like to hold the ruin of the motherland, but if not, the mother The nest has created hundreds of new insect warriors in time, and the body may also suffer trauma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Richard was that the mother-in-law in this face-to-face battle was not affected by the Harvester’s control instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard didn’t have time to stay longer, he immediately organized a hunting team based on the strong, the knight and the insect warrior. Take the stars and quickly rush to the nearest reaper squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Reaper’s attack on the turbulent land, Richard was keenly aware that the Reaper’s war potential had already bottlenecked and he continued to refine Yu Yu jīng Hua, finally limited the number of reapers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then follow this path, Richard believes that the reaper will eventually be unable to support it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long dark night, there was finally a glimmer of light. The question now is just how much blood Archimonde will flow before dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard was strangled in the innocence of Faro, the Holy Alliance finally launched an offensive on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Confederate Queen has no decision to kneel down to Xu Rì, the first place to rise, then Hetings and Long De Steader are also making a comeback, while following the undecided come to Xu Rì The place to rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is the first time I set foot on the fortress that Philippe personally laid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feet are the pinnacle of Philip’s lifelong martial arts, and the walls here still maintain the style of the Dakosodas era, and the guardian magic array is working hard. But the effect is not sè. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past period, Xu Rì’s first ascent has withstood the constant impact of Dakosodas, and on several occasions he is on the verge of breaking the city. Fortunately, the white night that moved the main battlefield here finally broke through and became a legend. In addition, although Richard did not directly send people to participate in the war, but the contribution was three times that of the normal floating island giants. With this fund, the Holy Alliance hired dozens of The name of the powerful sanctuary, this barely maintained the situation of the Xu Rì rising place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are standing on the top of the city, the Dakosodas siege war has just ended. At the end of the line of sight, you can still see The Dakso Das who slowly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowhere to stand in the city, suddenly raised his hand to the distant sky and said: "Who is that."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no turbidity standing next to the turbidity and Long Dested, the old Marshal has been fighting for many years in the dusk, very familiar with the Dakso Das. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distant sky, there is a small figure floating in the distance. In the eyes of ordinary people, it is just a little black spot, but the legendary strong can see clearly. It was a very special Dakso Das, some like a demon, a huge flesh wing slowly behind him, and three long tails swayed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Dakosodas is only three meters tall and can only be considered to be small in the Dax Sodas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Long De Steader is a pupil, saying: "That is the Black Wing, one of the top ten superpowers of Dakosodas. During this time, it should be his turn to sit in the dusk, but he did not expect that he would appear here. It seems that Xu’s first rise is their primary goal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Dakso Das's super strong." Uncertain sneer, "Philippe that idiot can run two, now this guy alone dare to appear here, is it to die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly broke off: "turbidity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbidity immediately took a step forward, one knee 跪The ground, the hands stretched forward, just caught the cloak that was indefinitely thrown, and the figure that had been fixed at this time had been continuously flashing, such as Changhong, across the sky, and rushed to the black wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black wing suddenly bursts into an earth-shattering momentum, does not retreat, and meets the uncertain, it is the top strength of Dakosodas. It is the pride of the entire plane, and it is impossible to escape without fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolling black gas emanates from the black wing, forming a huge black sè tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the huge tornado of this column up to several kilometers, no one can think of its source as the small body of the black wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the uncertain momentum has become more and more convergent, and later the legendary strongman of the series of Long De Stead almost felt Less than her existence, there is no such thing as a gray shadow, quietly immersed in the black sè tornado. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black sè tornado still raging between heaven and earth, no one knows what happened inside the tornado, how the battle is going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, it took a whole minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the Dakosodas or the Nolanders, this minute is as long as ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was finally a terrifying tragedy in the black sè tornado, a black shadow from the tornado inside, and directly torn the space, just a moment Drilled into the space crack, escaped without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black sè tornado was maintained for another half minute, only to blast, and turned into dozens of storms, rushing in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the core position of the original tornado, the purple body of the whole body is standing proudly, in her hand, holding a huge debris of several meters long, It is one of the two fleshy wings that the black wing is famous for. The flesh and blood is blurred at the root of the wing, and it is actually thrown from the black wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence between the heavens and the earth was a short moment. Suddenly, the Asahi Rì’s first rise was screaming, and the Dakosodas gave up the rigorous formation and began to flee. They each rushed to the fortress. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but no interest in following these shards who have just reached the Sanctuary’s combat power, but with half of the residual wings, flying to the Asahi In the sky above, the residual wing was thrown to the cheering soldiers below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long De Steader took a few steps forward, kneeling on one knee, and took the piece of the wing with both hands, expressing humility and surrender in the undecided After that, the old Marshal was lifted off and showed all the soldiers to all the soldiers who had risen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the blood of the soldiers has already boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because of the black-winged array, the Dakso Das people were able to attack the Xu Rì first ascendant with impunity, and attacked and attacked. If you can't attack, you will retreat, and you will be very calm and take the initiative. It is because of the black wing. Because no one can compete with the black wing, the three legendary strongmen simply dare not leave the influence of the defensive circle. The scope can only let the Dakosodas people come and come, and want to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past year’s offensive and defensive warfare has been extremely depressed, but today, for the first time, it’s the first time to step into the grounds of Xu’s rise. The black wing, even his fleshy tears are torn off, from the battle to the decisive victory, a total of less than three minutes, this is a showdown between the super strong, so the result of the battle, has shown the tyrannical domineering of the imperial queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a burning morale, he said to Long De Stead: "Tell Heitings, you can start."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty!" At the time of Cheng Cheng, Long De Steader was on one knee, which is already the highest courtesy of the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, it’s true that it’s really convincing the old marshal, in the field of the field, in the dusk, only the strength of the arrogant, overbearing violent Style can really serve people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing nodded, and said to the turbidity: "Let's go, wait for them to come out, let's come back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you wish, kneel down." The turbidity flies gracefully, and the cloak is draped, and then she follows her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
