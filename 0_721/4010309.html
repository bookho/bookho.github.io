			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church of the Spirit of Courage has long regarded the Sequoia Kingdom as its own territory. In the past few years, they have used various means to divide the parish with other gods and churches, and they have intervened in the kingdom affairs to attack the aristocratic family of ancestor worship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The church of the bloody courage in the House of Lords has actually been waiting for the war to be defeated by the Richards. To some extent, Richard’s words on the gods of the courage are deepened. It can also be said that the disrespect to the inner security is enough to become a fuse of the right to teach.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the powerful and arrogant god of courage is surprising this time. The choice of the silence of the corresponding three goddess church's voice with the success of Richard's parade is greatly increased <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sequoia Kingdom, there are more than a dozen or even It is dozens of believers who go to the temple of the three goddesses to ask for conversion<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was unimaginable in the past was only the temple of the god of courage more than 50 years ago, which helped the royal family win the war on the mainland road trade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the three goddesses developed more rapidly in the blood-stained land. As Richards stood firm in the blood-stained place, a large number of businessmen and adventurers smelled the smell of gold coins.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people who choose to settle in each oasis city. Many of the civilians who are dragging their families are attached to the name of Richard and swear allegiance to become his official leader. This figure was last time. I have already crossed the 100,000 mark and there are nearly ten times the number of slaves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most amazing thing for the three goddesses is that even behind the bloody place, Richard is powerful. The gods seem to have no interest in developing believers. There is only a simple little temple or a sand. In this small building where I live, I opened a small hall. This temple is not open to the public because of its location. Talents in the core circle of Richard can get in<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the income of Li Chaguang in the blood-stained land is more than five million gold coins per year. It is more than enough to create a great temple of the kingdom of the crown. How can he reluctant to come up with a little to build for the true God? The hall can be seen that their previous bold speculation is correct. It is a secret field of the neutral field. The gods are strong enough to not care about this belief. As long as there is no conflict of faith, the alliance between the gods will be very stable.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the gods of Richard are more intense. It is said that the two goddesses of hunting and forest also have the idea of ​​moving the Great Temple to the blood-stained land<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main shrine and The ordinary temple is different. It is also the foundation of a true god and is the most rapid and powerful place to develop beliefs and upgrade the power level of the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the goddess of spring water will be the main temple Moving to the blood-stained land is a very unexpected move because the name of the three goddesses is their priesthood and the blood-stained land is hunting. It is better to say that there are springs and forests.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the few months after the retreat of the main goddess of the spring goddess, her believers increased more than 2,000 people so fast growth rate and found that the powerful true God behind Li did not care here. Therefore, the two goddesses of hunting and forests naturally cannot sit still.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were not willing to go to Oasis City on the one hand because the natural environment is a bit uncomfortable and on the other hand The reason for the true God behind Li Cha <br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a covenant, the biggest conflict between the true gods is that the dispute of faith can be seen from the quicksand and the Russians according to the rules of the rules of the gods and the priesthood. It’s even possible that the unknown god can even be a powerful divine power in such a field that neither side is dominant. If the true god needs three goddesses, he must retreat. Therefore, the hunting and forest goddess does not want to be too restrained.<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since I found out that this true God does not care about the two goddesses, the goddess naturally refuses to let go of this wonderful opportunity. The goddess of spring water takes the first step and not only gets rid of the predicament of endangered divine power through the intruder war and the church. After the great development, the divine power is also far ahead of the three goddesses<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the wealth is the same for both the nobility and the church.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual stabilization of the situation of blood-stained land, Richard’s taxation on this land began to increase at an alarming rate. Now the annual simple crossing tax is close to four million plus to the territory’s permanent collar. The head tax levied and the overnight fee levied by the temporary conscripts together with the daily tax are five million a year and are still increasing rapidly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the number of applications submitted by the people who want to change to Richard’s permanent envoys broke through the 100,000 mark, the review procedures and conditions became complicated but still failed to curb the growth momentum<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the taxation on the territory of Richard is still much lower than that of other countries. The chances of making money here are also more. The tax rate of any permanent people in any field is much lower than that of non-recipients. From temporary to permanent, it needs to be Richard pays a sum of money or buys a piece of land in the new district of the five major oasis cities, or is to serve him for five years. If he can join the official army, then it is three years<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So Richard’s wealth is accumulating rapidly. The biggest result of this parade is that Richard has raised his interest in the line of business from the original 25% to 55%. This is a huge leap. The proceeds are more than three million<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the current blood-stained land has become a place full of gold<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp In the other part of the blood-stained land, Richard’s dwarf allies have been expanding rapidly in the past year. They have just annexed three small tribes and acquired tens of thousands of people and 10,000 qualified dwarf warriors. But the appetite of the dwarf allies is obviously not satisfied because The inspection is still in the process of transporting the grain and transporting the ore away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarves originally felt that their ore was inexhaustible but the trade channel was really opened. They immediately discovered that the ore that had accumulated in the warehouse for hundreds of years was falling rapidly. The demand from human friends was simply a bottomless pit<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the pile of giants in front of the dwarves Wealth also shines on their eyes, rich food, abundant spirits, all kinds of ordinary dwarfs, and even consumer goods that they have never seen before. They feel that they can be stronger, stronger, stronger and more endless and powerful.<br /> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that after all, Richard transported rare minerals back to Noland as a highly developed master of magical civilization. Noland’s demand for all kinds of materials is almost limitless. This is where Noland can support hundreds of plane wars at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the dwarves need to do now is to have almost endless ore in the depths of the mountain. Give it a digging Come to food, spirits, and all kinds of clothing and daily necessities. For the first time, they feel that the miners are not enough to get more labor. There is a shortcut. Therefore, Richard’s dwarf allies have embarked on the same path as humans. War and plundering slaves<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard returned to Oasis, he continued to live in a two-point line between the magic lab and the meditation room. She can already complete the first magical array that Richard has given her<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is actually a core functional magic array in the initial power. After the modification of Richard, the difficulty has increased. Of course, the addition rate has naturally increased.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 has The success rate of such a magical array can be completed in two days, although it is still less than 100%, but 80% is also a good number. The most important thing is that Richard only needs to pay extra on the basis of this magic array. One hour to complete a power-type non-standard structure between the first and second orders is also one of the wild suits<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleeping, combining sleep and meditation, but doing so will also have a negative impact. For a long time, the spirit will gradually feel tired. But Qi Qi seems to have forgotten that Richard’s warning has been insisting on such a loop. It’s been more than a month has passed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the Magic Lab, an elite human knight responsible for guarding the lab walked over to Richard Whispered a few words After listening to the face, I was surprised. Qi Qi’s current schedule is almost a copy of his work in the dark blue school<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elite humanoid knight retreats and Richard enters the magic experiment. Room<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic laboratory of Lanshui Oasis City has now undergone several expansions and has occupied an entire building. Alchemy from the Noland gnome country has begun to appear. In terms of the quality of this laboratory, the Noord has been able to squeeze into the first class at the cost of Richard’s investment in this laboratory. More than two million people have to stand on the ground to have a foundation of five million. The investment on the first floor is the workshop on the second floor of the workshop for handling all kinds of magic materials. It is a studio for various special purposes<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second floor of the working room, Richard saw the Qiqi who was burying his head and painted it. On the shelf, there were ten sealed boxes in each box. There are two standard functional magic arrays<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sweeping over and then falling back to Qi Qi’s hand, there is a kind of rhythm that can’t be said to have rhythm. It seems that the hard work of this time has improved her success rate and the magic has also increased to ten.<< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only after Qi Qi has finished drawing a functional magic array: “When the tenth grade is really good,” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
