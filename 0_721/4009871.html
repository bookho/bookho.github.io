			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the singing, the head of Xuan Ying actually began to tremble, and the neck was already The condensed section broke again, the wolf blood continued to flow out, and it climbed slowly on the altar, and the hammer of the warhammer that reached the foot of the statue gradually penetrated into the statue. Absorbing the fresh wolf blood, the statue seems to have come alive, and Richard vaguely felt that a strong consciousness was slowly waking up in the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the statue also had blood, and the blood of the flow was like a gaze, scanning everyone in the ritual hall. When the consciousness looked at Richard, the blood in the statue's eyes suddenly thrived, and in the consciousness of Richard, it suddenly exploded like a cockroach, and there seemed to be hundreds of lions roaring in unison, and suddenly shocked him. A black, almost lost consciousness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few powerful consciousness immediately merged into the soul of Richard, and violently collided with the will in the statue, and instantly rushed it out. It comes from the power of the soul to guard the water, the nest and the magic slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the strong spiritual power of the mother’s nest has now surpassed the splash, and in the recent confrontation, the undead mage Sandra, who is still studying in the hotel It seems to be aware of what happened, so he also participated in this war. Only his magic vows are much weaker than the magic slavery contract, and too vague connections make him unable to pass too much power. Otherwise, with the mighty spiritual power displayed in the swamp of the day, Sandro will give the invasion consciousness a heavy blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confrontation between the spirit and the consciousness ended instantly. The thunder hammer and other half-orcs suddenly came into a very strong pain, and they fell to the ground. When they climbed up, they found that the wolf head had dried up completely, like a dead body that had been left for a long time. The statue is bleak, and the lingering power of the sacrifice has spread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder hammer pressed his head a little dizzyly, staring blankly at the altar, falling over and letting his wounds hurt, his face hurting a little. Distorted distortion. He and the other half-orcs looked at each other, but they didn't know what was going on, so they could only be regarded as good sacrifices, which led to the ancestors' manifestation. And they are too weak to withstand the power of their ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders and the warriors quickly recovered calmly, while the thunder hammer dragged a little awkward steps, went to Richard and stared at his eyes. Shen Sheng said: "A stranger from afar, a respected sorcerer, because of your help, I can kill the shadows and avenge the warriors who have been maimed by the tribe. Now you have watched our sacrifices. From then on, it will be a friend of the Bloodstone tribe forever. Although we are not strong, we will not regret the sacrifice of life for our friends when necessary!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, the thunder hammer stretched out his arms and hugged with Richard and completed the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the powerful and powerful hug of the Thunderbolt, looking at his old face and covered scars, Richard suddenly felt that there was a kind of unspeakable taste in his heart. If you make a construction that is the same as that of Gangde, then the Thunderbolt does not need to use the scroll of the magical scroll, nor will it speed up the end of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least at this moment, the Thunder Hammer is a true warrior, a qualified leader and a friend who can rely on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the words of quicksand came to mind, and Richard remembered the pile of magic materials that were apparently looted. Every piece of material was definitely dyed. A lot of blood. And the Bloodstone Horde, and even the Bloodstone Camp, are not places that are friendly to ordinary humans. During the life of the Thunderbolt, his men did not know how many undead were produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of inexplicable feelings are intertwined, and Richard suddenly does not know how to judge the Thunder Hammer and his Bloodstone tribe. So he sighed in secret, but he remembered his identity as an intruder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a messy and cruel bloody land, it is still complicated and unclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the Sacrificial Hall, Richard looked at the statue on the altar. That ambiguity should have been hit hard, and now lurking back into the depths of the statue, began to recuperate. However, in the recent confrontation, Richard has already noticed that the power of consciousness has a bit of divine nature. Otherwise, it is impossible to preserve the will of the bloodstone that was left in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that Richard has come into contact with the power of ancestor worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard understands why the mother's nest wants the statue of the ancestor worship, and it wants to absorb the power of the statue. However, Richard now does not want to go to this altar of the Bloodstone tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, it seems that there are countless ancestral worship tribes in the blood-stained land and even the entire plane. I will find a lot if I look slowly. As for the Bloodstone Tribe here... just wait for the Thunderbolt to die! Anyway, he will not live for a long time." Richard thought so and comforted himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sacrifice, it is a dinner with a strong tribal color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several bonfires on the semi-circular open space in the fort, and the barbecue and inferior spirits were continuously supplied, and the half-beasts around the bonfire The rhythm of the drums danced with the rhythm of the drums. From time to time, I stopped to scream and scream. This is a ritual since ancient times. I swear to defend my homeland to the ancestors Yingling. When I am tired, I sit down to drink and eat meat, and then join the queue again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's bloodstone tribe's banquet has a few special guests, in addition to Richard, and his two ogres. Because of the presence of tiramisu and three-point ripe, there will be a large pot of fragrant broth. This pot of broth is better than anything that the chef of the Bloodstone Camp has made, so it is welcomed by the half-orcs who have no cooking tradition. With the standard of this pot of broth, the title of the two ogre gourmets is well-deserved, but they seem to only cook broth, so far Richard has not seen them do other cooked food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carnival, the only thing that makes Richard unable to stand is wine. He was forced to drink three bowls of wine with a thunder hammer. The bowl was very half-orc, thick and big. He also drank a bowl with each of the Orcs elders, and then drank a bowl with the most famous warriors in the Bloodstone tribe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So carnival dinner At the end, Richard was squatting back on the back of the three-pointer. He has not been completely drunk, but the tumbling stomach makes him weak, and his consciousness is like a fire, vague, and all the prudence and concern are always away from him. This wine actually gained a lot, at least the half-orc warriors that Richard can take away from twenty to thirty. But the extra ten can only be ordinary half-orc warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre's back is wide and thick, and the three-pointer is also very stable, but on the way, Richard still spits twice. Vomiting made Richard a little better, and the cold wind in the middle of the night made the mind clear, but the alcohol flowing in the blood vessels was still burning, making his willing erratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road, Richard began to think about tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
