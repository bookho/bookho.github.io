All the tips from the Eternal and Time Dragon have only one noun, "seed", and detect magic. And so on, there is no effect at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving the Eternal Dragon Hall, Vatican’s great priest called Richard, and he said a few words with him alone. She seems to inadvertently mention the practice of walking in the temples of other places on the mainland when she was a child. She has seen an epic episode of a pre-Kenoary war. The king of the kingdom of poetry praises a terrible war machine, the king with supreme power. Treat it like a treasure, and keep it from being around, and at all costs to protect and enhance its power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seriously thanked Vatican’s great deity, although her language was vague and vague, but apparently hinting at the use and importance of the seed, as well as the key resources of the future. Assign a sequence. In addition, Richard is also keenly aware that at the end of the sacrifice, the appearance of the great priest is extraordinarily beautiful, but it is such a short sentence of effort, Vatican’s eyes suddenly climbed up with some fine wrinkles, almost How old is it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most direct proof that Van Gogh has lost many gods! The priests who presided over the sacrifices would share some of the gods, and Vatican not only lost what he got, but also seemed to have lost more. The reason was obviously the words that he said to Richard. Such a simple and vague hint, which caused her to lose a lot of gods as a punishment, explains the importance of the seed from another angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before leaving the Temple of Eternal Dragon, Richard deeply said to the official of Vatican, and sincerely said: "Thank you for your guidance!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanline smiles gently, with a scepter in his hand gently on the shoulder of Richard, saying: "Lee, go and crush all the enemies in front of you, don't Kindness, this is the best thank you to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked solemnly and nodded, his body was straight and his face was thicker. The murderous spirit. In a few days, Richard experienced a lot of changes, and walked through the road to life and death tonight, has been tempered by the murderous inconsistency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon patted Richard’s shoulder and said, “Let’s go! Kid, your time is running out. To be exact, you only have one night to clean up. Things, set off tomorrow morning. As for other things, let's talk on the road! Ah, yes, take the things in your hands, don't let the thing leave you too far!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that left the Dragon Temple was the same as when it came, and Goethe was in front of him. Kade and Kellan guarded Richard, and Samma and Modred fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you descended from the Eternal Dragon Temple, you can still see that the floating island 7-3 is expanding and moving. The original 7-2 floating island is full of people, and countless lighting magic bullets rise to the sky, almost the entire floating island shines. In the magical light, you can see that many people on the floating island of No. 7-2 are fleeing from several buildings on the edge, and the rocks on the edge of the floating island are constantly falling off and falling into the clouds below. In a twinkling of an eye, several buildings on the edge of the building were also tilted with the collapse of the foundation, and finally completely separated from the floating island in the roaring sound, falling to the abyss below! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating island floats in the air of three kilometers. Without strong floating and flying skills, no matter what creature falls at this height, it will immediately die. What is even more awkward is that those rocks, vegetation, and other things that originally belonged to the floating island itself disappeared into the clouds, and the building wrecks and even the living creatures added later penetrated the clouds. Drop down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
