			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war years, Gordon’s Archimonde army and Shulan native The Kings’ team confronted each other and small-scale battles were carried out all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to counteract Archimonde, the Kingdom of Shulan needs to maintain a large and deformed army. Such military expenses will become the heaviest burden. Every five Shulans will have to support a soldier. This is even the old man and the child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment in Shulan is not good, there is almost no production in the boundless sea. There is very little life in the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing the Nest of Hughland, Richard already knew the truth. The ancient wars have actually destroyed Hulan. The current Shulan is just a small piece of land that remained in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the Kingdom of Shulan, the definition of happiness for the vast majority of people is that they will not be starved to death. Another figure can also reflect the situation of the Shulan natives, which is the average life expectancy. The Shulan people can usually live to forty and fifty, even if they live longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard and Senma returned to Shulan, there was a transport team that also entered Shulan. The caravan is not small, including 300 heavy-duty freight wagons, each with ten tons of grain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the transmission line and watched a freight wagon appear from the transmission array and then transported the grain to a large warehouse in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly asked: "Senma, if you are the most ordinary person in Shulan, what do you think now? Are you willing to live in the Kingdom of Shulan? , or become my people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma looked at Richard very strangely and said, "Is this choice, of course, follow you!" If you must say the reason, there are at least two! First, I can eat, and eat meat. Second, I dare to blame Akmond, as long as I am correct. The third has the first two Do you still need a third article?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said: "But some people still miss the Kingdom of Shulan and think that we are intruders, not ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These guys, killing the light is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha shook his head: "The killing is not a solution. And these people kill not only kill."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dearest, His Royal Highness, you are very strange today! Was it controlled by a Necromancer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled reluctantly and said, "Nothing, I think more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma snorted and said: "There are always some The guy is full and has nothing to do, wants to restore the Kingdom of Shulan and drive us out. If we don’t ship more than 100,000 tons of food a year to Shulan, we don’t know how many people will starve to death! In the meantime, I should only choose the same! I want to eat meat and want to marry my mother. How can this kind of good thing happen under the sun! The guy who thinks like this is better to let me cut a sword!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed long and said: "If it is me, the most wanted life is that you can eat meat and you can marry your mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp Senma immediately widened his eyes: "How could this kind of good thing happen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard, but we can work hard, don't we?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing away these feelings, Hughland is still quite calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are always people who want to drive out Archimonde, no matter which plane, such people exist. Even in the traditional territory of Archimonde, there are always people who dream of being able to overthrow Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard also has a solution to this, that is, at least let the people in the territory eat. It is not difficult to have Faro, a natural huge granary, and a star that can transport large quantities of supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can eat enough, although they can’t stop them, but the heart of the creation/reverse will fade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those who are always ready to riot, Richard will not be foolish and polite to them, always bloody suppression. This kind of policy, the followers of each guarding plane are very clear and fully implemented. Sometimes, Richard will pull them back, and only those who are indeed convicted will be allowed to kill directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Star has been hidden, and there has been no news, as if it has disappeared completely. But this is obviously just an illusion. How can a legendary strongman die silently? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been laying traps outside the portal. If Long Star raided the portal, he would find himself in the Black Rose Castle. Outside the portal at the other end, Richard is stationed in 30 knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Dragon Star dares to cross the portal, there is only one dead end. However, the Dragon Star reveals an extraordinary embarrassment, but it has never been able to endure it. It has never been close to the plane portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of curiosity is not something that ordinary people can tolerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Richard is preparing a fatal temptation for Longxing, that is himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Senma was alone in Shulan, he once felt the dragon star peeping in the dark. However, Longxing is too tolerant. Perhaps it is to see the senior equipment of Senma's whole body. Maybe it is pure fear of death and fear. It is more likely to wait for a bigger big fish. I don't know why. He just didn't shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longxing may be able to hide and endure forever, but Richard does not intend to give him more opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the Hughland plane, in order to prevent Longxing Richard from being equipped with a powerful force beyond the need, there are always 50 construction knights resident. And we must also keep Senma here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under normal circumstances, such a small plane does not need to be placed in the sanctuary, as long as the plane transfer gate is held. If the indigenous people inside dare to do something, the army will drive in again and it will be destroyed in a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days, an amazing news spread among the upper aristocrats of the Kingdom of Shulan, the ruler of the ruler Archimonde, His Royal Highness It will go to the Shenlan Nest to inspect and, by the way, will stay in the city of Shulan for one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hughland is a completely closed plane, and Richard once went to see the endless ocean on the edge of the continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After deep into the sea, time and space will gradually become disordered, that is, he does not dare to rush in the past, let alone cross the sea to find the edge crystal of the plane The wall is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the turbulent time and space area, Richard could not even get accurate coordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot transfer without coordinates. The lack of accurate coordinates means that the space is actually changing, and even a partial annihilation reappears. This is a phenomenon that should not happen inside the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every plane is actually a stable space supported by the underlying rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, considering the existence of the mysterious nest, perhaps these strange phenomena are the legacy of the war that did not know when it happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the Griffin, and Senma only took a day to arrive at the city of Shulan, and then appeared in front of the Wangcheng nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Richard reconstructed the Kingdom of Shulan and chose a local aristocrat as a king to continue to rule the entire plane with the kingdom's structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king is very aware of the current affairs, very aware that his position is entirely from Archimonde, and is naturally respectful to Richard, the Lord of Archimonde. To the point of numbness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get the news that Richard is coming, the king arranged the Wangcheng zhōng yāng square into the ocean of flowers overnight, and moved the landing platform of the Griffin to this place. Usually used only on the square where the grand ceremony is held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of young girls were sifted overnight, letting them put on the most gorgeous clothes and gathered in the square to prepare for the arrival of Richard. Half an hour earlier, the king led all the nobles who had the countertops in the kingdom to wait in the square. Behind them, they are dressed aristocratic ladies and ladies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king even called out all seven of his daughters, and lined up behind them. God knows if Richard will suddenly see which one, so If his throne is really stable. Although his youngest daughter is only ten years old, there are not a few nobles who like little girls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic bell rang, there was a row of black shadows on the sky, and Richard and his guards arrived in Hughland with hundreds of griffins. Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard has brought a very strong escort power. In addition to Senma’s presence on the side, the guard also includes a total of two hundred knights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
