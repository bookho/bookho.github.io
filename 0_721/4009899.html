			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He jumped from the battle and walked to the side of the black armored knight Open the defensive players who have already rotted, and then squatted and turned the knight's face over. This is a rough and savage face, still with a moment before dying. His hair was cut very neatly, completely military style, not as casual as the ones in this plane. This knight is dominated by human descent, but mixed with the characteristics of other races, apparently good at strength, defense and explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s precise talent and artistic intuition always give a very weird feeling. The mix of bloodlines that can be seen in his vision, as well as the incompatibility of the various powers, is even perfect. He couldn't help but think of a method of artificially mixing blood culture populations recorded in the Dark Blue Library. It seems to be such a mature body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, from the final traces of this battle, the Black Knight has the equivalent of fifteen-level combat power, but whether it is armor or weapons are standard products. The signs left on the battlefield also indicate that he is probably just a regular knight of a special unit. What kind of force does it have to be composed of the fifteen-level knights? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in Noland, such a force is definitely the ace of the giants, second only to the formation of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and raised his hand to call a dozen sand people slaves. Let them pull out all the weapons of the black armor and then remove the knight. The body of the black knight is still exuding a gloomy and horrible atmosphere. The savage and violent sand people have also shown fear. When they remove the weapon, their hands are shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heavy breastplate was unloaded and removed by the three sand people, another sandman pulled out the machete and cut open the linen-made armor. Clothing, revealing the chest of the black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly held his breath! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the chest of the black knight who has begun to appear blue, stabbing a lifelike bear head, below the bear head is a dark area, the upper line A complicated magical array. This magical array is very familiar to Richard, and can be redrawn with his eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the magic pattern! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard can already be sure that there is no magic pattern in the Faro plane, or something similar. Even if someone has successfully painted the magic array on the body, it is occasional, and it can only be on the strong. That's because the high-ranking strongman's carrying capacity will naturally be higher. The magicians of the Faro planes do not have the concept of carrying capacity, nor do they know how to calculate the bearing capacity required for the construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now the most basic magic theories, in the history of Noland, it’s been spent by dozens of legendary mages for hundreds of years. Only gradually improved and stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no need for other means to verify, and Richard can now conclude that the structure on the body is not a product of the surface and more than 90% The grasp comes from Noland. Because that's the standard first-order construct: defense, the effect is to reduce the damage by about 10%. Even if other planes have such a thing, there will be no difference in one line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands also stood up and saw the structure of the chest of the body, which was also very surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard never took care of the dirty and corpse smell, grabbed the scimitar in the hands of the sand people, and cut off the robes on the body of the corpse, and saw a standard initial power structure on each of the arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s face was very ugly, and he said slowly: “It’s the bear bear knight of the Bear Peter family!” Subconsciously, he used this sentence to blurt out. It is a long-lost Nolan German. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu sand doubts: "It's a bit like, but how are you so sure? The Knights with the bear as a mark are quite a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to the arms and chest of the body and said: "The two first-order forces with the first-order defense are the standard configuration of the town bear knight."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems..." The sand is still somewhat suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This knight is specially cultivated. It has a mixed blood of giants, barbarians, magic bears and humans. This is the unique warrior of the Schumpeter family. So I am sure that this is the town bear knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the body of the knight on the ground, the face of the sand drifted through a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different knapsacks are different in composition, but the threshold of the knight is too high, which makes many aristocratic forces start to build the class. 'Knight, for example, a four-frame or three-fit knight. Although these knights do not reach the strength of the knights, the reduction in the threshold has greatly increased their number, so that they can form combat power in a short period of time. At the same time, another advantage of the class-built knight is that you can use the old or secondary structure on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many giants have built up a very personal force after years of accumulation, and the bear-bearing knight of the Schumpeter family is one of them. The strength of the Bear Peter family is not in the construction, but in the cultivation of a special mixed-race bear knight. The town bear knight is born with a very high strength and strong defense, so the greatest benefit from the power structure, coupled with the defense and specially cultivated Capricorn ride, has become a powerful bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a future sacred architect, Richard is naturally aware of the existing configuration options on the mainland, such as the town bear knight This type of simple and extreme speciality is naturally heard. Each town bear knight has a fighting power close to fifteenth level. Although it has a far-fetched combat power of the true structure of the knight, the Xiong Peter family has only 30 less than the knights, but there are nearly two Hundreds of town bear knights. In terms of overall combat power, there is very little between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand suddenly wrinkled and said, "How can the town bear knight appear here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Chadong shrinks and said: "Since it is the Schumpeter family, there will naturally be no good things. And the town bear knights are sent over, indicating that they already know the coordinates and the upper limit of the plane. I think It’s no coincidence.” He suddenly raised his voice and cried, “Everyone, standing still!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard clicked on Gangde again. , water splashes and ogres, accompanying themselves to examine all the traces of battle left on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time has passed for a long time, the traces of the battlefield have long been blurred, they just came in a large number of people, it is difficult to distinguish clearly What happened. However, Tiramisu found a hoof print a few hundred meters away. Combined with the overall position of the dead bodies and abandoned vehicles on the battlefield, it can be judged that it was the position before the town bears launched the charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
