			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of this hive life tree, let Richard not know what to say it is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this is a special unit with only one. If it can be mass-produced, then Richard still needs to work so hard, running tens of thousands of kilometers back and forth. Planing two life trees back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hive life tree can be used as the base camp for the dark night. A honeycomb tree has grown up and can support tens of thousands of nights. With it, the problem of eating in the dark night will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the future, if Richard is willing to pay a hundred units of God, then the Honeycomb Life Tree will have a certain amount of space and powerful mobility. It can be as small as a star, so small that it can fit into Richard's backpack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also when in full state, it can move at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour. The loss during migration is also much smaller than the normal life tree, and the most surprising thing is that it can be migrated once a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this, Richard no longer hesitated and immediately said: "Building a hive life tree!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After dealing with the upgrade of the mother nest, it was time for Richard to leave Green Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this trip did not kill the world tree as Richard had expected, but destroying its glimpse of consciousness, it is equivalent to living from its soul. Tear off a piece of debris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being hit hard, Greenson World Tree is sure to have a lot of security, and its value to Richard is not that big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to Noord, Richard went to see Nyris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four emperors sat alone in the room and were reading quietly. That is a history book, and there is no use other than adding knowledge. This book is what she used to pass the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard came in, Nyris carefully placed the metal bookmark on the page, then put the big book down and said: , you are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded and said, "I am going back today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, then wait until you come next time." Neri Swin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nyris, you can go back with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nyris Eyes One Bright, but then dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and said, "No, I am staying here very well. In addition, Green Senli also needs someone to guard. Now I am there, even if The green ring came, and I was able to fight him in the golden tree of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee frowned and said, "But here The time flow rate is too fast, I stayed in Noland for a month, and here is almost a year passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time is sometimes poison, sometimes it is Good medicine." Niris said a famous saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing, the subtext of this sentence is that she wants to spend her long thoughts in the Greenson plane. This kind of thought is so obvious, even if she wants to cover up, she can't hide it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard and Niris became friends when she was still a man. With such an experience, Richard can only be careful to keep a distance from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Richard returned to Noland as a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard entered the room of Cocoa, the girl’s gas was darker, she even had some sensation, the thin face The bones are high and raised. Her abdomen has been slightly elevated, which is much faster than normal human children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He placed the box containing the life potion on the table, took a potion from it, handed it to the cocoa, and said, "Drink it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa leaned up to drink the potion, and after a moment, his face glowed red, his body began to surge and his life swelled, his face quickly became rosy full. And under the powerful potion of the potion, her bones on the whole body began to make a squeaky sound. If there were no other accidents, the cocoa would probably grow a few centimeters higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, the blush of the cocoa face suddenly began to fade, and the life force brought by the potion was quickly sucked away by the fetus in the abdomen. In the blink of an eye, she returned to the original appearance, but a voice came from the belly. Strong and powerful heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a bottle of potion again, handed it to cocoa, watched her drink, and watched it carefully. The potion of this potion is still absorbed by the fetus, and only a little residual life energy belongs to cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation has long been expected by Richard. Through real vision, Richard sees that the fetus in the cocoa is still a heart, but now It has become a fist size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the devil is different from that of human beings. The devil is the first to complete the core of the heart before the body appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, from the size, the core of the cocoa's abdomen is about to grow, and then it is time to grow out of the body. The life energy required by the body is added together, and no core is consumed much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha feeds a bottle of life potion to cocoa, sometimes it is absorbed by the fetus, and sometimes it will suppress the growth of the fetus and let the cocoa absorb more. Some life energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 30 bottles of the refining of the 30 bottles of the remedy, the core of the fetus is finally fully grown, and the body of the cocoa is all Repair, even the state is much better than when not pregnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard left the remaining life potion to cocoa and let her feel a weak drink. At this point, Richard was able to put down a mind, return to his study, and begin to deal with the backlog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that Richard saw was a letter from St. Martin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Richard, I am happy to inform you that your troubles are more. The dynasty cabinet is now discussing whether you want to wage war against you. Now It is said that the people who advocate war account for the majority. After all, you have done too much, and it is no problem to burn a Brahms family. How can you still leave so many living people? They can all be witnesses now. Changed me, I must burn the Dragon Wing Castle directly, instead of burning only one main house.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as the closest comrade, I can also consider Use the name of the church to help you settle this. Now I have at least half the confidence to do this. I will tell you later why I have such a big grasp. But now, I think we should first discuss the reward. The problem. Persuading the cabinet is not an easy task, there are some arrogant and mad people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think you've played the dynasty army, but don't think it's a wise move to wage war against you now, because my three Midrandes are still under your control. This is really quite unfortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, if you are willing to lift this dangerous control relationship, I am half sure to stop the dynasty from starting a war against you. How do you see this deal? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the letter, St. Martin explained why it is half-confident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now The church's highest deliberative body, the members of the cardinal meeting, there are two people left, the Pope and Martin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like this is the scope that needs to be submitted to the Cardinal Assembly, and Martin must agree, then the Pope can pass if he agrees. If it is opposed, the votes will become one-on-one and you will have to wait for the next meeting to vote again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard looked at him and laughed, which was essentially the same as the Pope's decision. Of course, Martin also played the same role on the issues initiated by the Pope. The opportunity for trading and balance is there.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing control of the three Midranden is a good decision that Richard has long considered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard left the dark hand to ensure that the last moment will not be counted by St. Martin. Now the dark card has been turned over, presumably After that, as long as he is present, St. Martin will definitely not take out three pieces of Midranden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use this as a condition, in exchange for the holy tree dynasty is temporarily wrong It is a good choice to start a war by yourself. The most lacking time for Richard is time. With sufficient time, his power will continue to expand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I immediately sent a letter back to Martin. The content of the letter is very simple: "Your Midalun is now zì yóu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Richard began to seriously consider the integration of his military power. This time in Greenson's biggest harvest, in addition to the life potion, is actually the mother's nest. Jin order. As for the world tree, it is already a matter of time to be planed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent nest is promoted from the ninth to the tenth order is not difficult, only need A lot of gods can be used. God xìng is precious, but it is not an option for Richard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
