			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Lord Orleans, the bottom line of our two empire is, no matter what The legion of the Legion can not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Dakosodas. This is a betrayal of the entire Terran. The act of giving up directly will never be tolerated." The Marquis smiled and answered, but the tone was unquestionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time in the Millennium Empire, a staff member whispered in the ear of Earl Kimbeyer: "Adult, Milanes is using you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young count has waved his hand, silent, watching him not care, as if he did not put the reminder of the aides on his mind, nor intends to The Marquis uses the word "we" to raise objections, but if he really thinks he can be deceived at will, it is naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Milanese is obviously not a naive person. He puts on a very high stance, intending to use the strength of the two empires to unite for the best interests. And clearly implies that the interests of the competition are willing to be fairly distributed, which is clearly a win-win situation for the Holy Tree Dynasty and the Millennium Empire. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; and so we sit Bayeux Earl does not move, sit Milaneisi Marquis jumping up and down, then put the interests of the Marquis hard-fought half minutes to go, Desperate to describe Milanes, in fact, is no more relevant, but the Marquis from the time when Long De Steader was in the palm of his hand, showed his determination to die, this determination is not high in a war Negotiations are relatively rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was keenly aware of this anomaly, and he sat comfortably in his seat, listening to the words of Milanese and the bloody grandfather, while The performances of the Marquis and the Earl of Kimbey are all in the eye. In his heart, the birth materials of the two envoys just received before the meeting are flowing rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Milanese was born into a family of ordinary nobles. The highest rank of the family was originally only the Viscount, a middle and lower aristocrat in the entire dynasty, in Miranes. In his life, he is full of derogatory words such as struggle, struggle and wisdom. He also has the same number of derogatory words such as conspiracy, blackmail and speculation, but the reputation of the Marquis is impeccable. In short, this is a struggle from the lower level. Come up and desperately catch everyone with every opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the mission of the Holy Alliance is undoubtedly regarded by the Marquis as the greatest opportunity in life, because the court marquis like him who is dependent on government affairs cannot be hereditary If the next generation does not have enough bright-eyed characters to take over, the whole family will be returned to its original shape. If Miranes wants to preserve the achievements of his struggle, he must seize this important opportunity for the country to expand its territory. Only such merits will be rewarded in the field, not just the short title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Kimbe Bay was born in the prestige, and also belonged to the top aristocrats in the Millennium Empire. This successful mission was just a icing on the cake for him. His current title and cover have already reached his position. At the peak, a successful negotiation beyond expectations can no longer bring him too many substantial benefits. In any case, the possibility of negotiation failure is negligible. The attitude of the two is naturally different. You can live with the gas, and you can maintain the aristocratic style. This is the difference in origin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Marquis of Milanese saw this, so he fought hard and made a lot of effort, and he needed the Earl of Kimbey, just for him. The program endorsement support only, in any case, in fact, the two empires temporarily formed an alliance at this negotiating table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Richard still thinks that the Earl of Kimbeye seems to be quiet and calm, and the young Earl’s indescribable appearance seems to have another card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the big man and Milanes have already talked about the key points. The old man said, "If this is your last bottom line, then I will not There is no choice of war. This condition has not preceded the precedents of the past few hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the showdown, Miranes was Calmly, he said: "Since the founding of the Holy Alliance by Charles the Great, in the past few hundred years, the three empires have not seen the precedent of no country in the country."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sentence, the iron-blooded tycoon was a setback. The Grand Duke sank a bit and said in a slow speech: "But we also have His Highness Su Hailun."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Helen has not proved that he is a super strong, and has never had a record against other Nolan's other superpowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, referring to the name of the legendary mage, even Milanese’s eyes are not in the eyes of Miranes, but the look is also changed. I have to be respectful, and the right color says: "His Royal Highness... is not a sacred alliance. If His Royal Highness is willing to take responsibility for the Holy Alliance, even if it is just a sentence, then I will immediately amend the demarcation plan."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was quite surprised, did not expect his teacher, and the first woman in his life, and left him with a radiant shadow of Su Hailun. Actually, the sacred dynasty can also get such a high evaluation, which shows that the sacred dynasty has completely regarded her as a super strong, although there has never been direct evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the iron and blood public momentum was once again frustrated. He was indulged for a long time, and he finally sighed heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, both sides have opened their cards, and the Holy Alliance has not been able to find the superpowers in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milanes began to re-mark the dividing line before coming to the magic map. The new dividing line is naturally not as aggressive as the beginning, but the same fierce and cruel Although it has retired half of the original plan, it still has taken away more than 1.5 million square kilometers of the Holy Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Kimbe Bay then stepped on, delineating the dividing line of the Millennium Empire, and also giving up 1.5 million square kilometers of territory, so On the part of the cross-over, the Holy Alliance will lose nearly 2.5 million square kilometers of territory, accounting for one-eighth of the entire Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iron Blood Dagong seriously looked at the two dividing lines, then went to the magic map, crossed out some important areas, and re-calibrated the dividing line. These important areas are strategic. There are some important mineral resources, and some are the core or historical territory of some big families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of the wealthy owners are very stunned. At this point, it means the basic recognition of the existing boundaries, but only some of the details of the bargaining It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire negotiation process, from beginning to end, Richard did not speak, just listening and observing, this level of political confrontation, Akmon Germany is still a newcomer, and Richard is also a newcomer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every sentence here needs to be carefully considered, and the finger will retreat at any point on the map. In the field, it will be thousands or even tens of thousands. The loss of the land of square kilometers and the loss of the corresponding important resources, any one cent of the dividing line, is actually a comprehensive contest between the strongmen, the military and the determination of war on the two sides, not as simple as moving the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the demise of the tyrannical tycoon, he was also shirtless and personally bargained with the other party’s envoys, and Richard’s heart suddenly passed through a deep sorrow. Whether it is a civil war or a plane battlefield, even though Faro has established a deep red duchy in the past, Richard has never clearly felt the true weight of the word "nation" as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
