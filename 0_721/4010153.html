My own guess, there is no real evidence. You just listen to it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Richard promised to come down and look relaxed. In fact, his heart was sinking a little bit, and the picture of the future reappeared in his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Su Helun who drifts in the endless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually... I think that the second time, His Royal Highness is Faro, who is ready to go. Her past goal is to fight the gods of Faro. To weaken them." After a sigh of relief, all the power of the gray dwarf seems to leave the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the ultimate enemy of the plane war is the gods of this plane. According to Richard's understanding of Faro, the number of Faro gods is surprisingly large and powerful. After the first battle, it is almost certain that the legendary mage will fight Faro for the second time. There is only one god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and pressed back something that was hot in his eyes. He looked up at the ceiling and asked in a plain voice: "Can I see the teacher if I am in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray dwarf hesitated and said: I am not sure. After His Highness is sleeping in his bedroom, the elf is responsible for the operation of the deep blue top layer. We are all unable to enter, but you are not necessarily. If the Highness has special arrangements, the elf will put a specific People go in. However, the slumber of His Highness is even deeper than the dragon. Even if you go in, most of you can only see the slumber of your Highness. In this case, are you coming?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I just want to see the teacher. I will go to dark blue tomorrow night," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the magic crystal is exhausted, and the light of the magical array fades away, leaving only a thick darkness. Richard stood quietly in the dark for a moment, and in the dark blue for five years like water, he continued to flow through his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly took a big step, walked out of the transfer hall, found the old butler in the castle hall, and said: "Give me three top-ranked griffins, I set off half an hour later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler was shocked and asked, "Now? You are not going to return to the Faro plane tomorrow?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a change, wait for me to come back and say it. Right, let Gangde take the warriors and magicians back to Faro, bring all the equipment. And so on, Remember to hand this over to the sand." Li said, grabbed the pen and paper, brushed a note, wrapped it with the letter, and handed it to the old housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler hurried away, and Richard grabbed a waiter and told him to prepare some vitality drugs and pack them. The waiter hurried away, and Richard stood in the hall waiting. When he was sitting, he stood irritated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Winnington rushed in and saw Richard, immediately blinking, and hurriedly came over. Winnington is still full of bruises, weak breath, and vain. Richard frowned and said, "You still need to rest now, not staying in the room, running around!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington’s face is slightly Cringing, but still came to Richard, said with a smile: "Licha, I don't know what to say, but... I think I have to come and discuss it with you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard frowned: "Say!" He didn't understand how Wen Nun suddenly became such a mother-in-law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington apparently began to be nervous: "Yes...is the thing of Qi Qi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is it?" Richard felt that his ears seemed to be unreliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the gaze of Richard’s sword, Wennington became more and more nervous, his forehead began to sweat, and stuttering became more and more serious: ...... Well, I think it’s not the same as other Mensa. I think you can give her a chance...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s mouth with a sneer Q: "What kind of opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example...going with you to Faro..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen Qi Qi?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...no, not..." Wennington has been incoherent, and cold sweats emerge from layers. He never thought about being so nervous in front of Richard. He even had the illusion that it was not Richard but Christon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪! Wen Ninghuan did not finish, his face slammed a burning slap! He stepped back a few steps, squinting and staring at Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stared at him and said coldly: "Menza used you as a bait for the purpose of killing me. I have two duels, for the sake of salvation. Your life. Now your life is saved, but you have the idea of ​​Qi Qi, you can do it! You Qi is so good, her surname is still Mensa, Mensa! That is the damn that Gordon Man is trapped in the eclipse of Mensa! Does this require me to remind you? Do you see her face, or chest, or even the butt, forget your surname?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington’s head was deeply lowered and his face burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of Richard is getting colder and colder, saying: "In addition, Master Wennington, I will remind you again, Qi Qi is my trophy, and you There is no relationship in fart! As long as I don't die, you don't want to touch her with a finger. If you want a woman, then win me and say it! We have the tradition of Archimonde, but we have to rely on ourselves to get what we want. Go grab it! Now this floating island, this territory, is made by me, that is, Gotton is back, and I have to win it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, Winnington is not such a person!" Vinica did not know when to enter the hall, seeing the angry Racha, can not help but rush to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted, his eyes swept over them, sneer: "You two are enough. One ten, one nine One will gamble with people to undress, and the other will learn to take the initiative to punch and beat people in the public, and then be killed by half!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard pointed to his head and asked: "The obvious traps are all jumping inside. What are you growing here? Do you think that with Lao Tzu, you are born to be great? Akmon Morality is dignified, but with your strength, you can defend the dignity of Archimonde. The dignity of Archimonde is not so cheap!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard pointed to Winika and Winnington and said, "This is the last time I have saved you for this reason. In the current situation of Archimonde, the family should not be sheltered, but you should give family support. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington and Venica were completely speechless. At this moment, a cold voice came from outside the hall: "This thing can't blame Winnington, I asked to see him, and persuaded him and you to mention me. Asked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Qi Qi walked into the hall, Richard’s pupil suddenly shrank and strode to the front of Qi Qi, and suddenly reached out and grabbed her. Neck, even one hand raised her from the ground! Both Winnington and Winika have changed their faces, but this time, none of them moved or heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Ms. Mensa, I am in a bad mood now, don't challenge my patience at this time! Here is the floating island of Archimonde. It’s not the site of the Mensa family!” Richard stared at Qi Qi, almost squeezing out these words from his teeth. "Give me his/mother/retract your set! Your face is useful to others, but it doesn't work for me! Nothing to play with fire, otherwise I will kill you immediately!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi’s figure is very good, almost a little higher than Richard’s, but she is being picked up by Richard in the air at the moment, don’t talk, even breathe, after a while There was a purple color on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Qi Qi’s eyes turned white, her hands struggled from soft to soft sides, and Richard suddenly let go and threw her on the floor. Qi Qi suddenly breathed into the air, and immediately rubbed her throat in her hands, coughing violently, unable to stop, and the whole person was twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She managed to calm her breath and slowly looked up, and it was Richard’s boots. Qi Qi continued to look up until she saw Richard's eyes. She looked up at Richard, but her eyes were as calm as water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha also calmed down and said faintly: "If it weren’t for your family that was behind the ghosts, how could I appear in the Faro plane? Some things too It won't happen. But you don't have to imagine, I won't change any of my decisions because of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words did not say: "One day sooner or later, I will kill Guangmensa." This kind of words do not need to be said, do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Richard raised his voice and screamed. The two guards immediately entered the hall, waiting for Richard's order. Li pointed to Qi Qi and said, "Bring her back to the room. Afterwards, her actions were arranged by the butler. Without me or the order of the old butler, she was not allowed to step out of the room. In addition, she guarded her guard. They all grabbed and became slaves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disposal of Richard actually warned everyone, especially Winnington. Qi Qi was finally eclipsed, looking at Richard, and finally a little more pleading in his eyes. However, Richard’s eyes were neither cold nor angry, but indifferent, so that her heart sank to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After handling the unexpected incident, Richard ignored the pale Winnington and Winika, left the castle hall and headed for the Griffin Station. The three griffins have been awakened and prepared for long-haul flights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the Griffin Station and turned over the back of a gryphon. He refused to stop for a moment and took a picture of the neck of the Griffin. The Griffin stood up and slammed its wings, slowly ascending, then turned to the dark blue direction, gradually accelerating, disappearing into the hustle and bustle of the night. The other two were also ready for the flight. They sang a long time and flew up, chasing the gryphon that Richard took. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's Holy Alliance, the night sky is pure and washable, a round of blue and a round of red string moons in the night sky. Occasionally, there will be a clear sound of the griffin in the night sky. If you look up, you can see that the three griffins are flying high in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
