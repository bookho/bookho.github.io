			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of Richard’s resolution of the Reaper rules has now reached the level of the giant ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this level, it is possible to reversely resolve some of the rules of the mother ship, even if Richard has never seen the reaper's mother ship. When Richard analyzed all the rules that could be resolved, most of the reapers had no secret to Richard. When he arrived, he had a great chance to disintegrate the reaper's mother ship in the number of shots, thus preventing it from exploding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother ship disintegrated, it is possible to get the reactivation technology and control center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requires control over the progress of the reaper, not too fast or too slow. Too fast is likely to cause the reaper to be alert, and they may directly detonate the mother ship if the war is hopeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Asa and Goshawk were separated from Richard and went to Richard for a team of reapers they chose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faro’s war is still going on, and the trauma of the plane is deepening step by step. Despite the addition of the Goshawk Asa, the speed of destroying the reapers is much faster, but most of the reapers are still wandering around, cleaning up the remaining humans on the Faroese continent and all the life that can be processed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, it is more than half a month passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland's time is just over a day. But this day is a very long twenty-four hours for the knights who guard the Black Rose Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to withstand nearly ten times more enemies in all directions. It seems that the army of the sacred dynasty will never be able to kill. Many of the outer castle fortifications were captured and retaken. So repeatedly, both sides dropped enough bodies on the focus of these battlefields. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talent of Aili’s use of soldiers was fully demonstrated at this moment, and the limited strength was used by her to achieve delusion. Maybe she doesn't have the ability to control every detail of the battlefield, but she still has the creativity in using the soldiers. In times of crisis, she can always have the pen of God to regain the battle that will collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This offensive and defensive battle around the Black Rose Castle, although not long, but Archimonde's resilience and madness, has been undoubtedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund did not know if they could hold on to the next hour, but the generals of the Holy Tree Dynasty were still nervous. They want to do their best to capture the Black Rose Castle and then seal the transmission channel, which is equivalent to trapping Richard in the private plane. Next...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is of course negotiations. War is just a means of striving for profit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s pointless to trap Richard, and it’s impossible to trap a superpower in a sub-level. As long as the Black Rose Castle was laid, forcing Richard to make concessions on the interests, the Holy Tree Dynasty reached its strategic goal. As for the killing of Richard, the fact that no one in the Glorious Church is a strong man is no longer an option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know that the rest of the time is not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between Archimonde and the Reaper is likely to produce results at any time. Whether it is victory or defeat, Archimonde's remnant power in Faro will be returned to Noland, and the defense power of the Black Rose Castle will be strengthened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on the third day, the generals personally went to war, and commanded the army to advance one meter and one meter, and removed all obstacles in front of them. This castle, which is said to be insurmountable, finally has the opportunity to show the power of the original design. Even in such a clear-cut tactic, it has caused great trouble to the sacred dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the advancement of the dynasty army seems to be slow, but it is solid and incomparable, making full use of the strength of the forces, leaving no chance for Alize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white castle's offensive and defensive battles reached the most critical moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard is returning to Lanshui Oasis City according to the scheduled time. A new battle report has been placed on Richard's desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the battle report and took a look, then took out the magic map of Ashan’s collar and looked at it. On the map, the latest situation on both sides has been marked. The army of the sacred dynasty surrounded the black rose castle from three sides, leaving only the side to the sea. However, there are also battleships of the sacred dynasty at sea to form a blockade line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very lively." Li’s mouth sneered. He immediately issued an order in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the Goshawk and Asa, who were returning to Lanshui Oasis City, changed direction and rushed to another Reaper squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goshawk at the moment has long had no easy-going appearance in front of Richard, but it’s a sharp-eyed, like a sword, and it’s already better than Asa. Not much weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the messenger of the flight, the Goshawk said: "This Richard, I really don’t treat myself as an outsider, use us in the dead!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa snorted and said, "Let you complain about doing such a small thing! Can't you do something for the mountains and the sea? You should know that we The suppression of the reaper must be guaranteed... Hey, Richard let us fight one more time, what is he going to do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goshawk smiled and said: "He is going to surprise the clowns of the Holy Tree Dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Richard went out of his study, unchanged. Steps go to the plane to the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sky suddenly passed a huge shadow, the stars slowly flew, and then unloaded hundreds of Frost Warriors and their new mounts from their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, three meters high, like a giant frosty samurai now also become a cavalry. The natural ability to carry their weight is not the ordinary ride, but the new unit made by the mother nest combined with the information of many dragons, the steel armor tyrannosaurus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel tyrannosaurus is similar to the ground dragon, but this five-meter-high behemoth is much higher than the ordinary dragon, their giant The mouth is so big that you can bite the horse, and the layered scales covered by the body surface shine with metal light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scales of these tyrannosaurus turned out to be all steel! In terms of defensive power, it even exceeds the body plate of the reloaded knight. The steel tyrannosaurus itself has a 16-level strength, and with the same 16-level Frost Warrior, you can already fight the top-level knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these frosty tyrannosaurus knights, there are a large number of night elves in the assembly. That is up to five hundred night elf shooters and five hundred druids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were originally the forces that Richard used to consume the reapers. In the original plan, they would have consumed seven or eight eight even if they did not die. However, the arrival of Asa and Goshawk greatly reduced the pressure of Richard, and the terracotta warriors were saved under the premise of maintaining a constant speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the war with the Reaper, they are cannon fodder and, if necessary, need to be in front of the meat shield. But compared to the private army of the other lords of Noland, these are all horrible slaughter machines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the portal, Richard hesitated and summoned, and thirty insect-like fighting units suddenly flew from the other side of the city. , quickly flew to the front of Richard to fall, and then discharged into a strict formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-meter-long giant combat unit has a metal armor on the top and bottom of the body. The surface is very clean and can be used as a mirror. They are amazingly fast and powerful, and a pair of blades that can be stretched up to five meters can be used to spread the reaper to the warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the new optimally designed unit developed by the Brood to deal with the Reaper, called the Blade Hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade hunter has a large pattern on the body, but this is not a decoration, but a mother nest developed, similar to the natural magic pattern of the magic pattern. Although this natural magic grain can only play the role of the first-order structure, but the strength, speed and body strength have been increased by 20%, the optimized combat unit strength has soared to the Sanctuary level. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called optimal design of the mother nest is mostly a worm-type design, and a small amount is a beast-type design. As Richard controls more and more of the rules governing metal and other substances, the insects produced by the mother's nest become stronger and lighter. The sturdy insect armor can support larger combat unit designs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These knife hunters are the secret forces of Richard and have never been used. However, Richard’s determination is now fixed. He has a map of the Black Rose Castle in front of him. Looking at the sacred army of the sacred trees, Richard’s heart sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since these people are all coming, then don’t go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment on the portal of the floating island, a legendary and dozens of Sanctuary strongmen are coming out of the special territory and heading for the Black Rose Castle. Transmission matrix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
