			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you want me to see the few clips? !" Richard is almost roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the fate of the arrangement." The old dragon apparently began to shirk responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was angry and rushed, but suddenly he vented after a moment. No matter what the old dragon was, the fate of Su Hailun and quicksand is indeed as shown in the picture. Only the fate of the mountains and the sea has been changed, and the future in the picture has not happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of time condenses a small crystal necklace on the altar, and then the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon fades like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the crystal necklace and reacted for a moment. He just sacrificed a whole ten top sacrifices and exchanged such a necklace. Doesn't that mean that this necklace is the item of the second level of grace? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the necklace and examined it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description of the necklace is simple: order fire. It provides the wearer with a channel to connect the rules of order, forming a place of order around the wearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a small line: only the space lord is used by the title owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no choice but to smile. This restriction is not as good as specifying that this necklace can only be worn by him. Until now, Richard has not seen anyone who has the title of a traveler, let alone the space lord? With the title of space lord, you can expel the vast majority of the eternal dragon temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard has a hunch that at this moment the abyss, the order of fire may have a crucial role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is always going fast, and in the twinkling of an eye it is the day of the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of the floating world is in turmoil, many sacred dynasties and the great men of the millennial empire also rushed to the fauna, want to witness the past a thousand years, humans to the abyss The second expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night elves of the brigade began to gather on the floating island and then entered the special territory leading to the abyss in batches. These extremely powerful night elves, with a team of thousands of people, are constantly coming out of the transmission array and then entering the transmission array leading to special territories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard was not on the floating island. He came to the gate of Faust, standing there, looking up at the head of the dragon Dala Moga, which had been hanging for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick, but with some strange accent sounds in the consciousness of Richard: "See you again, little guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard had a hunch, he was a little surprised: "You are not dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Dragon laughs Road: "I certainly didn't die! Charles's little means, how could it kill me completely?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in the eyes of Li, in real vision, There are innumerable regular runes in the chain that sees the sacred skull. Now the role of these runes is certainly not Richard, only a glance, he knows that these runes are functions of imprisoning, hiding and burning souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "I understand. Since you are not killing, then Charles the Great has hung you here, just to trap you. The soul, and always let you taste the pain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you insulting the noble dragon?" Dala Mo's roar in Li The consciousness of the inspection is like a thunderous roar. However, Richard slightly adjusted the rules, and the roar of the dragon became soft and sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dallas, you can say something if you have something. I still have something. If you just want to show the dignity of the dragon, then Continue to hang here. Maybe after I come back, I will talk to you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those, Li turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" Dala Moya had to stop Richard and ask: "Are you going to the Abyss Abyss?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Richard is not surprised that the dragon knows this, which is already a public secret in FS. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that you have the power to save the soul. And I have been imprisoned here for hundreds of years. I really want to go back to the abyss again, and then go back to the place where the dragons are haunted. If you can take them I go back, then you can get a good return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not ask the reward, but asked: "Take you back to the abyss? Re-engage one Is the great lord resurrected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dala Moa sighed and said, "I am in the abyss, and now I must have a new big lord. I will count Going back to the abyss, there is no millennium, and I can’t be a big lord again. Take me to the abyss, in return, I will give you the rules that belong to my abyss. This will go to the Abyss of Abyss. There is tremendous help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough is the rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition of the dragon is obviously not As expected by Richard. Richard did not answer, but suddenly released the spiritual power and explored the head of the dragon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Richard’s spiritual power entered, Dala Moya screamed, and its voice suddenly filled with fear: “You...you It’s a soul-hunter!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it’s too late, Dala Moya released his mental blockade to accept Richard’s spiritual power, at this time All the resistance is as smooth as ice and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual power of Richard quickly swept the head of the entire dragon, forcibly stripped all the hidden souls inside, and then the images of the three tetrahedrons flashed. Passed. In an instant, Richard has already launched the power of Isaac’s real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dala Moa knows the identity of the hunter, the soul is desperately rushing to the right, although he really wants to be free, but not It means being willing to fall into the hands of the creature of the hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the dragon feels a warm and comfortable whirlpool, which is so tempting in a colder horror than death, so he can’t take care of others, subconscious The ground rushed in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the three tetrahedrons of Richard, the image of the dragon slowly emerged. Its position is unusually high, just below the face of the three rules system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard’s body shape has quietly disappeared and appeared on the floating island of Archimonde. At this moment, the last night elf unit on the floating island has entered a special territory. Richard also stepped into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battlefield for the abyss, the dozens of strong people here have gone out of their homes at this moment, with a shocked look at the huge collection of Richard. army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full 50,000 night elves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are hundreds of strange flying dragonflies. These cornices are different from the past, they become a mixture of metal and flesh and blood, and also have a strong reaper style. At the same time, the surface of the body of the cornice is covered with dark red lines, which is an additional sign of enhanced fire resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These flying scorpions will serve as vehicles to enter the abyss together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the night elves, a powerful tyrannical presence is also eye-catching. Richard’s trip is not only to deal with the large number of demons in the abyss, but also to deal with the power of the great abyss of the abyss when necessary. Even if you can't kill it, you must at least have enough strength to resist. Therefore, such as no face, tiramisu, water, Zonghu, Freire, iron shield, etc. are all listed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk also made a special trip, and he said that such a precious opportunity to explore the abyss can not be missed anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the addition of Goshawk, Richard naturally welcomes it. Goshawk once had the status of a top scholar, allowing him to work in any environment. And his own strength is also quite powerful, 25-level Master, is not a negligible object at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the legendary strong, there are nearly a hundred strong people in the Sanctuary class. This is almost the full strength of Archimonde's system. This expedition to the abyss, Richard is also a nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk came to Richard and smiled and asked, "You have put the old bottom on. Don't you fear the fire in the backyard?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "After I left, Archimonde can protect himself as long as he can hold on for a few months. In the past few months, I still want to be determined. Can keep us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No? She is finally willing to stand on your side? Oh, it seems that the relationship between you is really not simple. Why not leave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Inspected: "After waiting for a while, there are still a number of troops not arriving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a huge portal suddenly appeared, and the one that climbed out from it turned out to be More than a hundred giant beetles with strange shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These giant worms, which are more than ten meters long, are short and thick, and they are a miniature version of the mother's nest, which is a bit clumsy in action. Surprisingly, the insects of these giant insects have large patterns of different colors, and these lines are all metallic. These giant worms are also a mixture of metal and flesh. Only the proportion of metal is very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get together, get ready to go..." Richard just ordered, suddenly glanced and turned to look to the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another small portal that came out of it and got out of a night elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one night elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His looks are beautiful and somewhat demon. The shape is indeed the night elf is no different, but the completely neutral appearance style makes people not clear his gender. The breath on his body is difficult to distinguish, but there is a desolation and heavy momentum that is only available in ancient blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for power, it is hard to see. However, this is not the real vision of Richard, so Richard is also surprised. Because he couldn't remember it at all, when he fell down, he had such a night elf with a level of 25. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is carrying a long-winged elf with a long-handed rifle in his hand. From the outside, this is an ordinary night elf warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard not only distinguished his rank, but also saw that there was an ancient blood in his body that he had never seen before! This blood force is extremely tyrannical, that is, there are unmatchable forces, there are hidden powers of thunder, and the vitality associated with the Golden World tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of such complexness is entangled in the same blood, blending with each other, but yet distinct. Such blood, Richard has never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
