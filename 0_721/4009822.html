			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third night, Marvin left the forward base alone, staring at the night Go to the territory of Sir Cokat. Sir Cokat is his father and the brother-in-law of Baron Fossa. Although the Jazz’s fighting power at the peak of his youth was not only nine, his own surname and this marriage guaranteed his title, and the system of Baron Fossa. In his position, he is even higher than Huber and Gao, only worse than Mintel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still a chaotic plane, although the battle between the nobility is not as grand and frequent as Norand, but it is also the norm. There are too many excuses for the nobles to fight. For example, if your horse stepped on my Tian Miao, whether it is reasonable or not, it is an excuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for a real war must be that one party looks at something on the other side, such as land, mines, certain specialties, or trade routes. The aristocrats who fought against their daughters or women were basically wiped out in the long history of war on the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mintai, a person who has both personal and military skills, is indispensable. Sir Cocart himself is well aware of this, because he has always been a very realistic person who can analyze the situation. Just relying on the marriage dress, it is not stable to his rich seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Wen went to find Cocart because of this characteristic of Jazz, to persuade him to stand on the side of the invader, at least to help in secret and support. He is confident that he can convince Sir Cokat, because the only son of the Jazz has now become a fallen man, becoming the enemy of the god of courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand can provide a way to believe, which is another crucial reason. This shows that the god of the ectopic face is already strong enough to penetrate into the plane. In the plane war, the local people treated the invaders to kill them. The main reason was the clear attitude of the planes. Because no matter how powerful the intruders are, as long as the gods are willing to pay enough price, they can naturally inflict heavy damage on the invaders, at least they can drive them away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these intruders are different. Their strengths are much weaker than those of the invaders in history, but they can provide faith! This means that in the higher level of the contest, the gods of this plane not only lose the overwhelming advantage, but may be at a disadvantage. At this point, Marvin has already used his experience to understand clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Marvin left, Richard also flipped through the map under the lights, scrutinizing the next attack target. There are already many densely labeled on the map, which are the result of recent trials. When Richard was repeatedly pondering, he suddenly moved his mind and looked up at the dark forest outside the window. Just now, the mother's nest came the news that it has evolved into a mature body, and now it is the first-order mother's nest. And it said that if Richard is free, it is best to see it now. Richard needs to decide the next evolution direction for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately put down his hand and went out. A few kilometers away, it was only half an hour for him. As soon as he went out of the base, two huge worker bees flew in the face and surprised Richard. Even in the daytime, when you see a giant bee with a body length of more than one meter, it will be no small scare. Fortunately, Richard immediately inducted the sense of consciousness, knowing that this is the worker bee created by the mother's nest, belonging to the hard work that helps it feed for nesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the worker bee, Richard came to an open space on the edge of the forest, then looked up and looked at the body length of more than six meters, both high and wide The three-meter mother's nest is completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than four days after birth, the mother's nest has changed from a small palm-sized creature to a now horrible guy, which makes it difficult for Richard to adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first walked around the mother's nest and carefully observed this strange contract creature. The nest is still covered by the black shell of the oil shell, and the abdomen still occupies two-thirds of the entire body, but not as deformed as it was originally. Its abdomen still has layers of folds and it pulsates slightly with the breath. The head of the mother's nest is about the same size as the original, but it is placed on the current body and is too small to be found. The blade is also the same size as the original, and now it seems that it has changed from fighting weapons to purely eating tools. In terms of power, the mental impact of the hen's nest and the power of acid squirting are much greater than a pair of huge blades. And its six knots become short and powerful, you can drag the huge body, of course, do not expect speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Was the mother's nest, what has changed since it evolved into a mature body? Looking at your current form, willn't it be a new ability to attack?" I am eagerly awaiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the mother's nest sounded in the consciousness of Richard: "No, master. I am not participating in the battle. The attack means still only mental shock and acid vomiting. But this is my ability to protect myself, and attacking the enemy is beyond the scope of my body. The enemy can only attack if it enters within 30 meters, and if they escape, it is impossible at my current speed. Catch up with them. However, after becoming a mature body, I have the ability to create combat units, and you can also treat them as warriors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Battle Unit?” This is a somewhat incomprehensible concept of Richard. “Like those worker bees?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother’s nest explains: “Some similar, but not completely The worker bee is the only unit I can create when I was in a young body. It has only a limited combat power, and it is similar to a strong wild wolf. A human-equipped low-level warrior can easily suppress them. The role of worker bees is mainly I collect food And it provides limited protection "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Richard nodded. For example, the worker bee, which is more than one meter long, looks very scary, but it is nothing more than that. The aliens are more than the terrible existence of it. In addition to the limited toxins that can cause paralysis, worker bees have no other special means of attack. A five-level warrior with a shield and a sword can easily deal with several worker bees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest continues: "But the combat unit is different, and its entire mission is to fight until the end of life. As a first-order mature body, I can now every day. Create three combat units, and all the energy stored in the body can create ten combat units. Originally I could only create the original combat unit, but because I got some special food in the young body, I can create it now. The combat unit has an enhanced option. This is the information of the combat unit. The original template is a general-purpose template that I created based on this plane environment. After I continue to upgrade, you can make subsequent modifications as needed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consciousness of Richard, several stereoscopic maps of combat units appeared, as well as a large amount of relevant information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a creature similar to the small Raptors. It has a strong pair of hind legs and moves in a bipedal way. The forelimbs are similar to the mother's nest, and have extremely developed, full-toothed giant mouths, bite down, even the whole body plate can bite! Its size is similar to that of a large wild wolf, with fierce short-range explosive power, and the ultimate speed can be more than one hour and 60 kilometers, which is faster than most horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of one-on-one, its combat power is roughly equivalent to that of a human five-level veteran. But a five-level veteran takes years to train and requires qualified basic equipment, while the combat unit can be three in a day. After the parent nest is upgraded, the production speed will be further improved. This basic combat unit, the hen's nest is called the fast-moving beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
