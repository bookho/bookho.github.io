What is the tax for everyone? I have never collected taxes from here before. If you set up a card here, you are not afraid of the bloodstone camp to know?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big man took a sip on the ground, then rubbed a heavy double-edged tomahawk and said evilly: "One silver coin per person! Big ones have to pay two! But you will know when you see it. Is it a bunch of poor ghosts, not even horses, but also think of bloodstone to try their luck? He paid the tax, if there is no money, there is something good for tax deduction. I will give you the tax. A brand, no one dares to bully you in the bloodstone camp. Bloody Mark is the boss of the Bloodstone Camp!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha frowned and said: "How do I hear that the boss of the Bloodstone Camp is a Thunder Hammer? Is it a boss?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan’s face suddenly looks Some unnatural, angered: "The thunder hammer is of course the boss, but the bloody boss is also a person who can speak in the bloodstone camp! Less his/mother's nonsense, pay the tax quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ogre was furious and screamed, and licked his teeth, and then slammed his feet, and some wanted to rush. His big feet stepped on the ground, and the ground shook for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing a huge ogres, the face of the big man changed immediately, clenching the Tomahawk and guarding him, and he said, "You want to What are you doing?!” The partners behind him also grabbed the weapons one by one and set the battle for preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dahan is not afraid of adult ogre, but he does not dare to underestimate, especially the three-pointed and other ogre are not the same, the body of the heavy armor Thick and the Ogre Warlord have a fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already seen the situation inside and outside the checkpoint. There is a camp after the checkpoint, which can accommodate about twenty or thirty people. Now everyone should be concentrated inside and outside the checkpoint. Together with the Dahan, there are a total of twenty-eight people. These people's weapon armor are all kinds of, wearing leather armor, wearing a lock, and even a leather armor, but on the foot stepped on the double-plate armor boots. Weapons are also varied. Most of these warriors are dark and red, and they can’t say whether they are exposed or because of excessive oil deposits. Looking at the environmental climate of the blood-stained land, taking a bath is obviously not a benefit that everyone can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observed these times, Richard is also aware of the strength of these soldiers. The head of the big man has about ten grades and belongs to the level of the Knights. The warriors are mostly between the fifth and eighth grades, and all of them look hot and hot, obviously they are the guys who often see blood killing. It is worthy of being a blood-stained place. In a small camp where the road is set up, it is actually a warrior equivalent to a veteran or even a non-commissioned officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched out a gold coin and threw it at the head of the big man. He said, "What do we do, pay taxes. The tax of these people behind me, one Is the gold coin enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold coins danced happily in the air, drawing a high parabola. In the sun, the rotating gold coins are scattered with dazzling light, and the eyes are a little stunned. On Qihui mainland, a gold coin can be exchanged for nearly 120 silver coins. There are still fewer than 30 people in this team. Even with a dozen or so winds, the crossing tax does not use a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang of the bang, the gold coins disappeared into the hands of the strong man. He spread his hand and looked closely at the beautiful gold coin. He suddenly took a breath and whispered: "It is the temple gold coin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Although the weights of the popular gold coins on the mainland are the same, they can be divided into three categories: the temple gold coins, the kingdom gold coins and the noble private coins. Among them, the gold coins cast by the major temples have higher value because of better color, exquisite craftsmanship and imitation. What Lee throws out is a temple gold coin cast by the Temple of Courage. As for the source, there is no need to say more. A temple gold coin can often be exchanged for 150 silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staring at this gold coin, the eyes of the brawny are a little red, and the soldiers are even more intent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when Richard coughed a few times, he woke up and asked: "Our tax has already been paid, bloody adult brand, can it be Give it to us? Since I have paid the tax, I think it is better to go to the Bloodstone Camp to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man put the gold coin in his pocket, The face is full of greed without disguise. He said loudly: "No, one gold coin is not enough, two are needed... No! Ten gold coins can put you in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The head tax is not a silver coin, how can it be enough?" Richard is also known to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now is a gold coin!" The strong man growled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did it rise?" Richard asked <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong man waved his double-edged sword The giant axe said, "It’s just rising!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other soldier got to the side of the strong man and screamed at him, reminding him: "Head! There are women!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong-eyed eyes screamed and shouted: "What woman! We are collecting taxes here, not robbing women. Money, what kind of woman did you go back to the camp? You guys have a good time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior was timid, but insisted "Hey, these two women are not the same, you look at it again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brawny is looking at the person behind Lee. This is a very strange team, not only two ogres, there are elves, there are more than a dozen domesticated demon wolves. Of course, the strong man can't distinguish between the wind and the wolf. Even if they don't look at them, Gangde is also a very attractive person. His huge size and arrogance will even make people wonder if he will be a powerful barbarian warrior. In addition to Gangde, the three captains in the descendants are naturally majestic. The two women in the team, sand and water, are now wrapped in white robes to resist too much sunlight and heat. Although they can't see the face, the standing posture can be described as elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier’s gaze is on the feet of the splash. In any environment, the girls are barefoot, and a pair of white feet can be seen under the robes. They are standing on the hot gravel road with the tip of the foot slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing such a pair of feet like pearl mother-of-pearl, the strong throat of the strong man moved up and down a bit, swallowing a mouthful of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a gold coin from his pocket, but the strong man waved his hand and said, "The tax is not in a hurry! Hello, the two women, Take off my robes and show me! If you are willing to accompany me, the crossing tax will be free!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the water flower is slightly sunken, ten crystal clear The toes open and firmly grasp the ground. This is the sign she is ready to do. Richard is laughing and laughing, throwing up the gold coins, and dozens of gold coins are flying in the air. The sparkling light even overshadows the charm of the water and the feet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
