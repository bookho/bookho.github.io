			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is illuminated by the torch, especially near the magic city There is also a team of fully armed fighters guarding inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night wind suddenly became louder, and the torches that blow the city’s head were indefinite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night sky, a bat began to push down the height, and even a few glided through the camp. Within Richard's consciousness, several spots of light approached or reached the intended location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time is up." Richard inadvertently issued an order, and then instigated the horse, leading the followers straight to the blue camp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderous horseshoes are clear in the silent night, the guards of the city’s guards are stunned and look out to the outside, and now they’re on the patrol. Time, but why didn't the police still run so urgently. The soldiers standing in the wall smiled and said a vulgar piece, causing a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leading the followers to rush out, the rows of fighters stood up neatly and ran to the blue camp, except for a few sounds in the whole process. No one is speaking outside the drinking order. The priests and pastors stood on both sides of the team and were busy sending blessings to the soldiers passing by a team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the city’s sentinel is still loyal to the surrounding area. At this time, the knights on the main road of the blue square camp have appeared from the end of the field, although not More than ten rides, but not a patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentinel was shocked and even stayed a bit. This is a veteran. After many defensive battles in the Blue Camp, I can’t believe that I’m planning to do so. Punch camp. But he immediately reacted that there must be more enemies in the dark! He didn't even have time to greet his companions, and he rushed to the alarm bell in the tower and tried to pull the ropes. The loud bells rang all the way to the camp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the eager marching speed of the short-distance is not inferior to the horse's nesting warrior has followed, fanned to the blue camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue camp wall is six meters high, which is a hindrance for ordinary fighters, but peaceful for the real strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha is like a horse, this is a few times away from the blink of an eye, and soon rushed into the bow and arrow range. Less than half of the city's defenders had to complete the action of finding bows, arrows, and launches. The first round of arrows flew out and smashed more than a dozen arrows, no matter whether they were strong or accurate. In the face of Richard and his followers, even the slightest interference with the running of the horse did not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a faint figure on the side of Licha, which was much faster than the horse galloping. In a blink of an eye, he rushed to the side of the camp, When I was raised, my feet were on the wall of the camp and I went straight to the city. Then the sword light flashed above the gate, and the archers who had just been in a hurry were screaming one by one, and they were picked down the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctuary Swordsman Luofu! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Faro Sanctuary is not the Holy Land of Noland. Once it is besieged by the enemy, it is mostly to be hated on the spot. The Nolan Sanctuary is 18th level, which is equivalent to Faro’s township, and which Sanctuary does not have a few pieces? Only they have the power to go in and out of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Luofu smashed the Quartet in the city, Richard had already rushed into the 100-meter. As soon as he pulled the horse, the horse screamed and sprinted from the front to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard on the horse waved the fate of the twins and fired five instant fireballs. The fireball is extremely accurate, and it is one every 15 meters. Under the addition of the staff, the power of ordinary fireballs has also increased greatly. The fire waves instantly covered the entire tower, and even Luofu was drowned together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of fireball coverage is full of blows, but Richard knows that the effect is limited. Luofu has a martial-level bodyguard, and before the charge, Clark has blessed the magic resistance, so the fireball damage to him is minimal. The guards of the Blue Camp were all experienced and experienced. When they watched the fireball, they immediately fell on the ground and protected the head. Therefore, the rolling fire flowed over, except for the soldiers who were too close to the fireball, the other soldiers were only slightly injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard’s coverage of this round of fireballs is only for the follow-up forces to gain time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the suppression of the city warriors, a total of two hundred throwing soldiers have already rushed to the distance of 20 meters below the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luofu! Leave the city!" Richard was magnified by magic and sounded above the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luofu is out of the sword like a wind, a sword falls on a bloody fly, killing is really hearty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the ordinary soldiers on the head of the city were crushed by a round of fireballs by Richard. At this moment, they are rushing to get up, and they are known for their speed and sword skills. In the eyes of Luo Fu, who has the effect of war and sorcerer, it is a live target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, there were more than a dozen soldiers who died under his sword. So when I heard the warning from Richard, there was a hint of hesitation in Luo Fu’s eyes. Instead of leaving immediately, he waved his backhand and cut off the head of a soldier. In his heart, most of Richard had to bomb the city with magic. But now he has two magical effects in his body. Even if Richard uses six levels of magic to bombard, Luofu feels that he can resist at least one wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he hesitated, suddenly a very dangerous feeling came and instantly made Luo Fu’s face change! His ears trembled and caught a very sharp whistle, which was expanding rapidly! He couldn't think about it, screaming and screaming directly into the city from the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When still falling in the air, Luofu heard the dull sound of a bang on the head of the city, then the whole city suddenly became silent, and even a sound The screams also came to an abrupt end! On the head of the city, it is now dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a roar broke the silence, the wooden tower suddenly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luofu only feels that his throat is dry, what kind of attack can cause such a result? This is completely killing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rush of shaking in the night sky, and a huge bat swept past the city. Then Richard’s voice rang again: “Luofu! Stick to the wall and stand up!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Luo Fuyu stood close to the gate, although he had Hundreds of enemy fighters are rushing to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another whistling in the night sky that made Luo Fu’s heart beat, and the fluttering bone blades flew over the city wall, then slammed down under the rotation, and fell into it. The garrison in the back of the city gate! The bone blade of the same size as the axe is very powerful, and even the unlucky warrior is centered by the bone blade! When the nearest bone blade entered the ground, it was only five meters away from the city gate, and the sharp wind that was brought up caused the Luofu hair to fly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Fu suddenly felt that the scalp was a little numb. He had stood in front of him and looked at the hundreds of bloodthirsty warriors. After a round of bones, there were less than half of them standing upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war god official Io also rushed to the city, the body of the horse was like a flowing stream, when he stood with his hands crossed his chest, his posture was sacred if he stood in the temple and sang and prayed. He kept chanting the spell with an awkward voice, and blessed the humanoid warrior who rushed to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of arriving soldiers were armed with heavy steel spears, and they shouted their short spears to the camp wall! The steel spear penetrated the wall and only showed a short spear on the outside. Two rows of warriors threw short spears and formed two rows of steps that could be stepped on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde holding axe with a roar, strode to the camp wall, borrowed a force on the spear, has rushed to the city, then jumped into the city . The earth shook a little, obviously he had landed on both feet, and then the iconic hunger and thirst screamed again in the night sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Gangde, is a five-row humanoid warrior with a one-handed axe. They also fly to the city and then jump directly into the battle group behind the city. . For a humanoid warrior whose strength has reached nine levels, there is a foothold, and it is not difficult to climb the six-meter camp wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnants of the city behind the gates were slaughtered in a few breaths, and the gates of the Blue Camp were finally pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this happened only between the lightning and the fire. When the alarm sounded in the night sky, the gate of the Blue Camp had been captured by Richard. The soldiers in the camp have just rushed out of the barracks, and even did not have time to assemble into a formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the depths of the camp, a sudden momentum rises to the sky, and then the loud and screaming voice: "Who is looking for death!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing the snoring momentum, you know that it is also a sanctuary strong! Then a very tall and strong man was bathed in the fire and strode to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a large gun made of fine iron in his hand, and the gun head is also burning like a fire. A few hundred meters apart, his gaze was on the Luofu under the city. The pupils shrank and snarled again: "The shameless thing, the strength of the ordinary warrior, the fucking roll, let the old man cut you. The thing of the long bird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luo Fu’s face flashed, this sanctuary has a seventeen-level tactical level, and the battle is stable and stable. he. However, Luo Fu was not afraid of it. The more the people came out, the long sword was dragging on the ground, and the sword tip shot numerous sparks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sacred strongmen approached quickly, and when they took over, Luofu suddenly showed a sly smile, took a delicate scroll from his arms and whispered What is the word, the scroll immediately burst into a dazzling brilliance, and Luo Fu is covered in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a gun and a brawny, his attention was all on Luofu’s body, and he couldn’t keep up with the glory. He couldn’t see anything in his eyes, and immediately stepped back two steps. The rifle is standing up, the vindictiveness is released, and the flame is swallowed around the body. Luofu’s warfare is obviously not as good as himself, but he is so fearless, and obviously he relies on this scroll in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, the glare flashed, and Luo Fu’s body was covered with a layer of slowly floating Sheng Hui. The original long sword disappeared and replaced with one. The stalk has the size of a huge sword in both hands, and the giant sword that is condensed by the dark golden radiance, the sword has a lot of gods flowing slowly. Luo Fu looked smirked, his wrists shook, and the huge lightsaber was as lightning fast, and he had already bowed his head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
