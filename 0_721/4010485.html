			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the altar light curtain fell, the sands rushed in the first time. Directly ask: "Is there a lot of options with the distribution of God's grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, how do you know." I know that I have made a mistake. The grace that the sands get in this sacrifice must be especially special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand gently, and hate to say: "Hey, I really didn't think that the old dragon actually played this hand, you give me remember, next time You must not choose this kind of grace. These are traps. Although it will give me some extra grace, but more gods will be used to strengthen the book of time. The book of time is not mine, but belongs to "Eternal and the dragon of time, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the book of time is not in your hands, and is it used by you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case now, but as long as Eternity and the Dragon of Time are willing, you can take it back at any time, or take the time inside to change it back to the original Form, it is just a legendary item, and all the gods I spend on it will disappear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie has a strange look at the book of time, After absorbing a lot of gods, it seems to be nothing but a little more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the book of time and asked while he was watching: "This thing sucks so much grace, how is it now?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't see it, this guy is already an intermediate artifact." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichahaha smiled, stuffed the book of time into the sand, and patted her face and said, "Is this not very good? Anyway, it is also you." Use, no loss, in addition, the eternal and time dragon really knows the people, when those options appear, I can not refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words of Richard let the sand slip out of the deep taste, she was speechless for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't think so much, go call all the followers, there are good things." Richard said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the flowing sand to the outside, Richard said to her again: "Don't worry, there are some sacrifices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowing sand snorted and whispered:" It seems that you can get the sacrifice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, all the followers came to the altar, their eyes were immediately placed on the table The time is drawn by the hourglass, and Richard is standing in front of the altar. He doesn't know what he is thinking. The altar is built in the original statue. After taking the book of time, it is just a pile of stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the followers arrived, Richard smiled and said: "This sacrifice has gained a lot of life dew, so you each have one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One per person, followers look at each other, then start cheering, extra life, anyone likes it, it has a special meaning for women Because the appearance of life dewdrops will not change at all, the next distribution process is very simple, Richard has already set a good plan, life dew has two years and three years, such as tiramisu, Ola This kind of natural life is long enough for a guy who naturally gets two years. Splash, Sand, and Clark give three years. What’s unexpected is that Twilight and Zonghu don’t need two. The people also got a life dew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can use it to change something you like." When Richard checked the life dew to both of them, it was said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of many people are immediately bright, especially the water, the girl’s desire for life dew does not need to be said, but she has almost no long things except Outside the knife and combat equipment, there is no more thing to exchange. When the sand is seen on the side, she walks to the girl and whispers something in her ear. The girl’s eyes are first bright, then they change. He was hesitant because she knew that the sand was given to her own things. She couldn’t even get it. The sand was not allowed to oppose her. She took the life dew directly from Zonghu and Twilight and stuffed it with water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what she used to exchange with Twilight and Zonghu, it was not a problem at all. Other followers only shrugged regretfully, but as long as they followed Richard, life Dewdrops are not always a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the absence of Gangde and Qi Qi, they naturally have one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, on the eastern border of the Principality, Gangde was lying in the middle of the camp, lazily basking in the sun, and a shadow suddenly passed over his head. Gangde opened his eyes slightly and saw the empty floating in the air. The feather snake yawned and prepared to continue his nap. At this time, the air feather snake spit out the time hourglass. Gangde subconsciously copied it in his hand and saw what was in his hand. Immediately, he yelled and jumped up from the lounge chair and shouted: "Hey, I love you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War around the guard Many of the guards showed a smile, but Gangde was not the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde did not hesitate, directly crushed the hourglass, a small golden sand directly into his body, he felt the body Change, immediately rushed into the camp, turned out the mirror and tried to shine, while feeling his face full of stubble, while meditating to himself: "It’s really timely, and in a few days, I will become Old man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And earlier, Qi Qi stood in the window, took the hourglass from the feather snake, and held it in her hand for a long time. This is a sigh of sigh, gently breaking the time hourglass, but her eyes are deep, but not much joy, but more awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind Qi Qi, is a fairly large hall, the hall is divided into a semi-detached work room, dozens of young mages are separated Working in the room, more than a dozen lower-ranking, younger mages are rushing back and forth along the passage to serve the mage at work, not only to send magical materials and components, but also to include tea. Qi Qi's work room is independent and taller, which allows her to overlook the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people in the hall, but they are silent, all the people are busy with their concentration, the working compartment has a special magic array, which can isolate the magic fluctuations. To avoid mutual interference, it is costly for this facility. Fortunately, when Richard left, she left millions of start-up funds, and Qi Qi sold some of the construction recovery funds in Noland. It was only after the establishment of such a stunning studio of magic. This scale can no longer be described by the studio. It is a workshop. Even if it is rare in the workshop, it should be invented a new word to describe it. The magic factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that is in front of you is an unprecedented scene in the history of Noland. In the tradition, all the builders, even the first-level apprentices, are also It is a group of people living at the tip of the pyramid. Every constructor should look up and try to climb up the peak of the structure. Drawing the composition is a sacred and noble activity. The ink flowing out of the magic pen can be exchanged for any Things, never imagined, the difficulty and the extent of the build can be reduced. Qi Qi even allows young wizards who can't even make the simplest construction to have a place to play, they at least You can draw some simple magical arrays of functions, and what Qi Qi needs to do is to combine these basic functional magic matrices to build a complete structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure thus made has many shortcomings, they are not refined enough, so they have higher requirements on bearing capacity. They are not the overall drawing framework, because the addition range is much lower than the standard structure. The fabricated fabrics may never reach the level of simulating blood abilities, and even most simple abilities can't be simulated, but their output is quite amazing. Counting, this magic workshop can produce four pieces a day. The magic material used in the single-frame construction is more than the normal structure. However, due to the steady increase in success rate, the magic material consumed per unit of lifting is lower than the normal structure. Those young mage are everyday. The magical array of only a single function is drawn, and the success rate is naturally surprisingly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 returned to his studio, did not immediately put into the work, but opened a booklet, the first half of this booklet is Li Checking the design drawings for the practice of Qi Qi, now Qi Qi has been able to complete most of them. The second half is a lot of strange designs. That is what Richard told him to leave this time. , all how to connect the structural design of each functional magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the second half of the design, Qi Qi suddenly felt that there was a slight sorrow in her nose. All her ideas were undoubtedly in the eyes of the regular builders. The radical person even thinks that she is insulting the profession of the builder. However, after hearing the thoughts of her, Richard did not have any doubts. She not only found her more than 70 mages who had exceeded the original promise, but also specially extracted the whole two. In the evening, she designed a connection scheme for various functional magic arrays. There is nothing more than that, which shows Richard's support for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Qi Qi’s heart, she couldn’t tell the unclear taste. She put down the album and went to the window and looked at the mages who were working below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her dream. Before she met Richard, her wildest imagination of her future has not reached this level. It is impossible for the great magister to have so many talented mages to work for himself, but now she, a 14th-level wizard, already has it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream is already in sight, but she feels that the present day has no imaginary happiness, recalling that at the beginning, and Richard was squeezed into a magic laboratory. When I don’t understand anything, when I have to learn, it’s really happy...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪悚惊悚惊,心心狂狂跳,想问She is doing this, but she knows that she does not dare to face this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
