			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked very detailed and checked for an hour, then stood up straight The body, took a breath, said: "Very perfect, dear Sir Li, you are a genius, these three sets of Midalun's standard is not inferior to the original version left by St. Peter, although the original version has a long history It will be a little unrepairable wear and tear, and you are not a legendary mage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin took another look at Richard, his face flashed and surprised:" You are already legendary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also slightly shocked and said: "Your eyes are very good." After these few days, he has stabilized the legend. In the realm, there is no uncontrollable power, and at this time he is in a relatively relaxed state. As usual, he should not be able to see the power level at a glance,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp St. Martin no longer concealed, two flashes of light in his eyes, but gradually faded away, smiling: "God gives me the insightful eye, you can see through one The things under the surface, but the use is not very big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s answer made Richard secretly scared, not aware of the so-called insightful eye and himself What is the difference between the real talents, Richard certainly knows the usefulness of real talent, if this is not very useful, then I really don't know what makes it useful,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the inspection, Martin put the same pieces back into the magic box and called the two middle-aged knights to let them return the sacred box to the sacred dynasty.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Until watching the four followers disappear into the magical array, after a while, the peace information is fed back, and Martin relaxes,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he smiles Turning his head and said to Richard: "There is no way, this thing is too important, but it makes you look at a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know that you also have something nervous, I can feel at ease." Richard replied, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two entered the study, and Richard sent people to refreshments and wine,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin first proposed a drink for the successful cooperation between the two, and then said: "Now the transaction between us has been completed, I still owe you a promise, one does not Set a friendship"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly paused. "You, you don't want to cash it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "I have a problem now. You need your support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin stunned, then smiled bitterly: "Even if you feel trouble, that is the big trouble, say, what." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee simply said the decision of the asylum Nyris and the passage of the matter,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Martin listened and listened, and even the expression of bitter smile could not be kept. When Richard finished speaking, his sweat on his forehead oozes out and he has to wipe it out with a square towel.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also called trouble." Martin shook his head helplessly, sighing and sighing,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood Get up, turn around in the room, and then can't help but blame: "You are simply crazy, Nyris is just a prince, how important is it, is it worthwhile to put the fate of the whole family? Who is under the arm, not to mention the great achievements of this woman in the past, that is, in front of her, she is alive from the outside world, you think that in her eyes, what sacred alliance, what the royal family is really important, those for her Nothing is, I can't think of anything that she has to worry about or care about. Such a super strong person, you dare to provoke, she is the most terrible type, you are not trouble, this is Suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s complaints are endless, and Richard listened patiently and said, “So, your promise cannot be used in this matter. "Is it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s eyes glanced and snorted: “I didn’t say that, as the future Pope of the Church of Light, the glory of God The first person, my promise will never change, I just said, you have to figure out that this matter may not be solved peacefully, and most of them have to fight one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin looked at Richard, heavy He sighed and shook his head. "You are crazy. Hey, no way. If you really want to fight with the crazy woman, count me, hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Richard is a glimpse, he originally wanted Martin to support his political position, but did not expect this guy to be willing to participate directly in the battle,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard stood up and reached out to Martin, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do." Martin asked,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Allied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awkwardly, this time Martin knocked out Richard’s hand: "I will form an alliance with you, I will die very quickly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day has passed. At dusk, a royal messenger came to the floating island of Archimonde to inform Richard that there will be no early tomorrow morning. The Queen wants to see him,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always a visit, and when I get the news, Richard is relieved,<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning at 10 am, Richard arrived at the mirror hall of the palace on time,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Richard, floating island The owners of the giants have arrived all the time, sitting in their respective positions, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the owners of the family arrived, the indefinite and turbid flow into the mirror hall, < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen Shi Shiran went to the central high chair and put himself Going in, lifting his feet, and directly on the conference table, while the turbidity is standing behind the indeterminate chair, his eyes staying for a while in St. Martin, the latter raised his head and revealed a standard clergy to him. Smile,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing lazily said: "When people get together, let's start, Richard, you took my little toy, this is going to happen. How to confess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lichao straightened his body and said in a word: "Nyris is my friend, he is not your toy, I will Protecting him will not allow you to be like him anymore. For this reason, I will do whatever it takes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is a war." Nothing is still lazy. , "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it is a war." Richard’s original slightly warm tone completely calmed down at the moment, but the calmer he is, the more people see it. His determination, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone did not expect the two sides to go straight to the subject as soon as they came up, only to talk about collapse in a few words, several homeowners Moment after another opening to try to ease the stiff atmosphere together, <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Unable to turn a deaf ear, while looking at his nails, he said, "Give Nyris out and pay enough compensation for your rudeness. This is a temporary matter." Her voice is not big, but she wears it. Through the mouths of the people, she clearly expressed her will, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many homeowners who are much older than they are, they are all The decisive battle was heard, and it was also possible to guess the entanglement between the Queen and the Four Emperors, so most people chose silence,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a time mirror Quiet in the hall,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Shen Shen said: "The last generation of grievances is the last generation, should not be involved in the next generation, Nyris is My friend, he should not bear these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No smile, raised his eyes and looked straight at Richard: "Who said this and the previous generation's grudges Related, I just like her, want to play with her, what's wrong, who can object, who dares to oppose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also meditating, his face is blue,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the undecided Queen is obviously Without any roundabout interest, his face sank and he recovered from indifference and coldness. He said, "Lee, do you know why no one is against it? It is because they know very well that this throne has no meaning to me. What laws and rules? It’s all a piece of paper. If I want to, I can slowly kill their entire family. You can’t stay with Nyris. The result of angering me is that you are buried by Archimonde. Are you willing, or, I am killing you directly here, who can stop me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s face is extremely ugly, and his most worrying thing finally happened,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of absolute force, all politics and strategies are useless. Therefore, even if there is no legend, the giants must have the ability to balance the legend. Similarly, think and Super strong people talk about the conditions, they have to get the corresponding chips, when the super strong only speaks of force At the time, there is really no good way to deal with it, and like this, it is a super-powerful person who has nothing to worry about and has no scruples. It is even more unsolvable,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time, St. Martin stood up, haha ​​smiled and said: "The beautiful Queen Majesty, why bother to get things unsolvable? Maybe we should follow the ancient tradition a little, you put forward a feasible condition, Completed by Richard, the wisdom of the ancients is still worthy of consideration. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
