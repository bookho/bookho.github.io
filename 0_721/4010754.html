As for the similarity, it is not just the appearance, but a certain law hidden under infinite data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha just thought deeply into the depths, suddenly suddenly became a sharp pain in consciousness, and the surrounding world suddenly became a white flower. Richard immediately knew that this was just thought The rules to be clarified are beyond their ability, so that consciousness is caused by overloading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding flowers gradually fade away, and the vain world begins to appear again. It seems that during the time when Richard lost his ability to observe, there seemed to be many more in the world of nothingness. Unfortunately, Richard has no way to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to restore the perception. When Richard looks around, his consciousness suddenly falls into a state of stagnation. There is a ridiculous land in the distance from the distance. It is extremely desolate, the sky is solid black, the earth is covered with cracks, almost no vitality, there are a few twists of thorns on the ground, can't tell if it is a plant, or something else, but just look at them. The twisted form seems to make people feel their pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a lonely and quiet world, clearly without a light source, but still able to map out the scene, only a small piece of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in that land, in the inanimate world, there is actually a figure walking alone, her body wrapped in a black cloak, At a constant pace, there is no way at her feet, and there is no end in the distance. It is so lonely to walk, as if to measure the end of the world with both feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has only one figure, but Richard wants to scream, the figure is too familiar, familiar with no matter which angle, no matter how far away, he Can recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when to start, sand, the name gradually settled into the deepest part of the heart, becoming a taboo that cannot be touched, and Richard even forbids himself to think of her. Perhaps when standing outside the legendary gate, perhaps once when he touched the legendary road, he quietly banned the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once she thinks of her, Richard is afraid that he will not be able to control himself and directly enter the legendary realm. Instead of grinding and tempering as he is in the Jin Dynasty, he will find the most suitable road and prepare for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the legend, the powers of the strong are different, and the gap between them is too big to be decisive, and almost impossible to reverse, such as Su Helen, matched by the summoning master and the magic furnace, has made her a strong force when she has just stepped into the legendary realm, and can force most of the legendary powerhouses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of dark areas can easily make the legendary powers fall, and Richard wants to go deep into the dark areas to find the sand, which is not the ordinary legendary strong. When you get to the dark area, you will die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard has been sinking his heart, doing things one by one, building strength, developing resources, and constantly improving the level of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later, Richard’s personal strength and his stalwart force have advanced by leaps and bounds. It can be said that even in the Holy Alliance, Archimonde can deserve it well. A floating island on the sixth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Archimonde’s only weakness is that there is no real legendary powerhouse, but since no face has been added, this is no longer too The big shortcomings, and when Richard made the king of the sacred metal, and successfully integrated it into the gray suit of everything, his own strength is no longer under the ordinary legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abhorrent slaughter after the change has brought him the extremely powerful ability to decide the fate, with it in hand, and then with life, everything is gray and The extreme sharpness of the moonlight can make Richard’s instantaneous lethality jump to the point of horror. The two wars of killing Cha Talay and the bronze scales show that Richard is not relying on the faceless war madman. The weakest legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Richard is already qualified to move on the edge of the dark area, which puts Richard’s mentality into a subtle and dangerous situation: he really wants Go to the dark area earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandsand, what kind of position does such a woman occupy in her heart? Richard doesn’t know the answer, just knows that she must temporarily forget her. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never imagined that in a deep meditation routine, she saw her again in this wonderful world of nothingness, real talent told Richard What he saw was not a phantom, but a kind of reality. It was a sand in a certain time and space segment. Somehow it was intertwined with Richard at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the secret room, Richard yelled and suddenly woke up. After he recovered his consciousness, he immediately sweated and felt exhausted. It seemed that he had just fought with countless powerful enemies for several days and nights, not only spiritual power. Even the magic has bottomed out, and the state is worse than when there is no meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to sit up, suddenly felt a sharp headache, almost lost consciousness again, he fixed his mind, closed his eyes and rested for a while, wait a little After recovering a little physical strength, I slowly climbed up and moved out of the secret room. When I came outside, he found several bottles of magical power and physical recovery medicine. He drank it in one breath and rested for half an hour. Come out, this dare to carefully examine the state of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, Richard’s body is filled with countless tiny broken mouths, which are caused by excessive consumption of magic and caused by the state of magical dryness. These injuries are It doesn't matter, you can recover as long as you take a few days of rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked for a chair, sat down slowly, and began to try to recall the details of the world of nothingness, the strange warship that was obviously different from his time. And the lonely sand that walks in the silent world is clearly present in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the anchor mark provided by the real talent, Richard knows that what he sees is true and true, but he does not know which time and space the scenes occurred. It may even never appear in the world where he is. When time and space are intertwined, it means the world's highest secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed softly, leaned back, leaned back on the chair, closed his eyes, knowing that he had to wait, just this For a moment, he seemed to be ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Richard opened his eyes and began to slowly start his wisdom talents. He continued to analyze the rules as usual. As for everything he saw in the world of nothingness, he Still ready to be temporarily hidden in the depths of memory, until one day is ready, and then extracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisdom talents, in the past, I felt that the difficult calculation analysis suddenly became a lot easier, and Richard’s slight glimpse, only to find that wisdom was promoted unconsciously. The first order is now the seventh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This promotion does not generate a new independent will, but simply increases the speed of calculation. For example, the resolution time of the Shulan nest is from the fifth order. The order of a million days has dropped to about 250,000 days. Although this is an amazing leap, it is still an unacceptably large number, but it is the time required for the complete analysis. Wisdom talent can be upgraded to two levels, in fact, you can start the work of parsing the rules of the nest, most of the legendary strongmen have focused on a certain field throughout their lives, and only control a small part of the rules in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how did this meditation enter the dark and empty world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the whole process carefully, and finally felt that most of it was related to the doomsday mark. He took out the doomsday mark and injected a little magic into it, wrapped in crystal. The irregular metal began a crazy evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only looked at it for a while, and it was a stun of stun, knowing that the mental energy that had not recovered much was consumed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the day is really magical, tracking the changes in its internals will always overload Richard’s intellectual talent, which is why the wisdom talent is quickly broken. Even if wisdom is now seven-order, the pressure of the end of the imprint on Richard has not been alleviated. As long as the end of the study is constantly analyzed, Richard’s wisdom will be raised again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is far more powerful than Richard by virtue of its size and ethnicity. It is also a good idea to hand over the mark of the last day to the nest. The choice, but I do not know why, Richard always had inexplicable concerns, not willing to let the mother nest touch the end of the imprint, and now the mother nest has an independent soul, even more can not let it touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the imprint contains too many secrets, it even has a mysterious control power, the virtual world that almost trapped Richard in the night last night, obviously Related to the end of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of legends about the reaper, once again flowing through the heart of Richard, Richard has once verified the authenticity of various materials, but found that they are only Legends only, those records are all from the future fragments seen by various prophets, and no one has actually encountered the reaper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the reaper is related to the doomsday mark, then the power of the reaper is unquestionable, and no one knows when the reaper will appear, maybe for hundreds of years. No, maybe tomorrow will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the doomsday mark in the event, there is always a shadow in the heart of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and rested for a while before he left the room. He informed the elite knights in the blue water oasis city, let them as soon as possible Send a box of the highest level of magic and physical recovery medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
