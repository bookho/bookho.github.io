			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping the battlefield is really a hard work no less than fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lot of trouble, finally, with the help of no face, Richard finally succeeded in neutralizing the black hole. Shadow creatures and other messy summons were also cleaned under heavy blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiamat is only less than ten meters away from the black hole. Its mood at that time was almost exactly the same as being dragged into the half of Su Helun. But that time, he was dragged in, and this time it was alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the black hole disappeared, Richard finally breathed a sigh of relief, then suddenly felt that the night space was far and clear. The whole world has also become fresh and lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a cheer shouted somewhere in Faro. Gradually, there are more and more cheers, and people are coming out of hiding places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the clear night sky, they no longer have to worry about the screaming fighters, they can walk freely. There will be no more high-energy beams falling from the sky, and no mechanical beetles will crawl over and dismember their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reaper is defeated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensity of this news can't be described in words. In the history of Noland, no one has been able to guard his own plane under the reaper's claws, but at this moment, Richard did. He did pay a painful price, but the miracle was finally born in his hands! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quietly floating above the real base of the Reaper, and felt that the whole world became less real. Only the dense metal buildings that are scattered all over the earth reminded Richard that everything in the past was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is over...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a duration that is not counted A particularly long-lasting war, but for Richard, it seems as long as it has been through centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, an indescribable solemnity and majesty emerged from the void, covering the entire land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goshawk, Asa and Freire all felt that they looked around in a panic. The top powers of these tribes have produced a hint of fear from the heart, and do not understand why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and the sea and the faceless are thoughtful, and the gods of Faro are silent at the same time, and their eyes are on the northeast corner of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of Richard, a light spot suddenly emerged from the void, fluttering to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, this situation, in the quiet night, the wind is not, the chill does not know where to go. This light spot is like a firefly in a dream, flying to Richard, just like the only warm flame that is thrown into the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was unable to tell the silence at the moment, he extended his right hand and wanted to pick up the light spot, but the blood in his body, the image of the tetrahedron Quietly emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light spot plunges into the regular tetrahedron and then melts into it, and then the face of a young girl appears on the tetrahedron. She smiled sweetly at Richard and then disappeared into the four sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the soul of a little girl from the Faro. I don’t know why it didn’t dissipate. I have only found its final destination until now. Perhaps the reaper is locked in the base, perhaps just because there is a desire to let go, so it has been floating in the void until the power of obsession disappears, it will be completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the void, there are several light spots that represent the soul, some hesitating, but still attracted by Richard, flew over. In the base below, there are some soul light spots scattered, they seem to feel the existence of Richard, so the original purposeless drift quickly became a direction, flying in the direction of Richard . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a bit stunned and somewhat awkward. He doesn’t know what to do, and he doesn’t know what to do, letting a little bit of light rush into the tetrahedron. The integration of each soul will give him a little strength and give him a heavy responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goshawk, Asa, and even all the strong in Faro felt what happened, but couldn’t know exactly what it was. They just vaguely feel, perhaps at this moment, they are witnessing the emergence of certain miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong can't see the glory of the soul, but the gods can. All the gods of Faro, regardless of their original position, all the thinking at this moment has been stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky here has slowly turned into a star-studded world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless soul light is coming out of the void, and is coming from the base of the reaper, and is pouring from all over the land of Faro. , gathered to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the night sky of Faro, each soul light spot is a star, and they all come together to form a galaxy that is extremely spectacular and slowly swirls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the Milky Way is Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his injuries have been restored, and the whole body is emitting soft light, and the imaginary shadow of the tetrahedron is enormous, until it crosses the sky. At the top of the pyramid made up of light, there are three faces floating around, which represent the three rules of order, chaos and neutrality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this scene has been engraved into the depths of the gods of the Faro, and will be eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noland ushered in an ordinary day, Richard Back to the floating island, the Black Rose Castle began to be busy again, and a team of soldiers and knights came in and out, scheduling frequently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mex finally let Richard complete his promise and return to the Millennium Empire with hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Freire appeared on the floating island of Archimonde, it immediately provoked a small storm. Because of this hot body, the beautiful girl who ran to the fascinating city of Fu Shide went to the city to see the delicious fun, and provoked countless small troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever someone asks a sin, she publicly declares herself to be a little lover of Richard! In this way, all the people were indeed stunned, and she became more and more happily tossing around, and then constantly carried out the name of Richard to scare people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s not very important for her to lift the name of Richard, because the legendary level of tyrannical atmosphere can’t be concealed, and it’s been seen by people who have already seen it. . A young and legendary strongman, the background of his life must be terrifying. If you play with such a small game with her, you can get a closer look, but there is nothing more cost-effective than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard heard about Freire, he rushed over and rushed over, grabbing her back neck and picking her up. She had already plagued most of the merchants in the lower city of Fu Shide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just like this, everyone is sitting on a rumor that Freire is a little lover of Richard. Of course, all kinds of secret self-fortunate. What strength is Richard at this moment, naturally the whispers of the aristocrats and civilians who are not so powerful are all in their ears, and they are mad at half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the floating island, when Coco saw Freire, he could hardly believe his eyes. She wants to embrace her daughter, but she is afraid to go forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, Freire did inherit the strong blood of Richard, and even had long argued that her talent is still above Richard. And her legendary level of strength has undoubtedly proved this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cocoa is still just an ordinary woman, her illusion level has not exceeded five levels. Both people are different in their position and strength. One is already the top-level legend of Noland, and the other talent has not reached the average level of the family. If it is not the aura of Archimonde's surname, the strength of cocoa will not meet the basic requirements of becoming a free man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco looked at Freire, and Freire was watching her, and the eyes of the girl in control were obviously a bit blank. Coco's lips moved, and finally gave up the idea of ​​embracing her daughter, but took a step back and prepared to salute the legendary powerhouse in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire sighed helplessly, stepping forward, bending his knees and stuffing himself into the arms of Coco. The whole body of Coco was stiff first, then the tears suddenly burst out and hugged Freire. The girls' eyes were slightly closed, and they rubbed a few times in the arms of Coco, and then they were comfortable to pick up the red ponytail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa just hugged her, tears rushed out, she knew it was wrong, but could not stop crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire sighed silently, struggling from the cocoa, laughing and reaching out to her and saying, "I just played with my father." A big cockroach, almost died! So, I want a gift!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! Gift, I have, I have it! You Come with me!" Coco desperately wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes, tightened Freire with a slightly damp hand, and rushed to his residential area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new floating island is much larger than the six-story floating island, so the residential area allocated to Cocoa is also very large. However, the facilities in the residential area are very simple and should be basic equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was normal, leaving room for cocoa to be arranged according to your preferences. However, after seeing each other in a room, Freire did not find a few pieces of furniture that were in line with the nobility and were purchased by Coco. Not to mention the status of Archimonde's current top mainland giants. If something is not an antique with a lot of stories, it is actually a bit unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco returned to his bedroom, took out a pretty little box from the cupboard, hesitated, handed it to Freire and said, "I I don't know that you have grown so big. So I didn't have a gift at the moment. These are the things I want to wait for you to grow up, and then I will buy you some better equipment. Because after all, you will be on the battlefield in the future. A little better will be much safer. But now... there is not a lot of money here, just use your pocket money and buy something you like!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freire opened the small box and saw that there were neatly placed magic crystals, about 50,000 gold coins. From this figure, Cocoa not only saved most of the allowance that Akmond sent to her every day, but even Richard's extra money for her housing area was saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleier whispered, happily took the gift and said, "I have a gift for you here too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, she shakes the space bracelet on her wrist, and a lot of clothes, jewels, and even some antique furniture are poured out from the bracelet, and the eyes are full. More than half of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These things are all on the face of the giants, and the value may reach hundreds of thousands of gold coins. Their source is not to be mentioned, but Freire was brought back from the major merchants of FS in the name of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These businesses will not come to the bill, they would like to take a little relationship with Archimonde. But with Richard's temper, he will inevitably send someone to pay for Freire's account. Hundreds of thousands of gold coins in the district, I want to sell Archimonde a human condition, but Richard’s face is not so worthless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equivalent to Richard’s disguised purchase of these things for cocoa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
