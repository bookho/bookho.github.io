That is the sign that Io was promoted to the fifteenth level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is thinking about using the ass, and knowing that the combat priest is definitely intentional, that is, the 19th-level powerhouse breaks through, and it is impossible to have such a huge momentum. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard now does not put Iran and Russia in his mind. Although this guy has some ulterior motives on the sand, his role in the battle is truly unique. And never play tricks during the war. As for this kind of limelight, let him go out. Richard thought, his mind has been placed on how to continue to develop the blood of the magic star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry of the coalition forces are all elites of the nobles. Although Richard has taken advantage of it, it is easy to defeat the enemy and kill the enemy. In order to defeat the seven thousand cavalry, He still paid more than a thousand casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the coalition forces that lost all the cavalry were like a tiger with their teeth removed, and the rest were infantry, which was not enough. The only thing that can be considered is that there are at least 13 great magisters in the Masters Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Battle of the Sunset Plain, Richard did not rush to march, but announced that he would accept the vote of the other camp's nobility. Even the aristocrats who just met on the battlefield, as long as they are willing to invest in Richard, can not be swayed. Richard gave the nobles three days to consider, but if the three-day time passed, the nobles who were still on the same front as the Masters Association, Richard would not guarantee their safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This declaration once again aroused an uproar among the aristocrats of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dispute, the aristocrats who joined the Masters Association, except for a few, have long been interested in the interests of the association, and the rest are certainly not true support associations. The trade rules, for most nobles, are a hand on the throat of their own expansion, but the nobles do not want to be sanctioned by the Masters Association. The power of the Masters Association has long been deep in the hearts of the nobility in the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic props and enchanted weapons are one of the highest-end equipments of the Faro plane. If the procurement channels of the country are blocked, the comprehensive force will be lost. Level, unless there is that ability and financial resources to make up from other sources. After all, those aristocrats who are able to remain neutral are strong enough not to be troubled afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In private, there is no lack of aristocrats to identify the behavior of Richard to challenge the monopoly status of the Masters Association. However, the position of a family is not affected by personal likes and dislikes. Only the winner can make rules, and only the rules of the winner can be accepted. At least before the Battle of the Plains, Richard didn't look like he had a chance to win. No one expected that the situation in the blink of an eye would have evolved to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the aristocrats of the coalition forces once again fell into a chaotic dispute, arguing with each other, blaming each other, and quietly operating under the table. However, the latter was destined to be disappointed because Richard did not accept any private confession, except for the aristocrats who were extremely prepared to act as undercover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Richard once again marched forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Richard only brought cavalry and highly powerful barbarian warriors and throwing soldiers. He rushed into a hundred and fifty kilometers a day and swept four aristocratic territories loyal to the Masters Association. On the four territories, the garrison of thousands of garrisons collapsed. One viscount, two barons and a jazz became the captives of Richard. The women in their family were all turned into slaves and assigned to the nobles who followed Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this decision, Richard only said one sentence: "I am an enemy, I want to have dignity!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a cruel decision and a very powerful decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard’s decision was passed to the head of the vice president of the Master’s Association, Ryan’s demon, the talented magister was smashed on the spot and was able to be smashed in the office. Broken everything! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Richard! He doesn't deserve to be called a nobleman!" Ryan's roar rang through the entire building! He did not think that as the initiator of the war, what he did to provoke the incident was much worse than that of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the shock of Richard’s incomparable strength, most of the nobles of the Sequoia Kingdom chose neutrality overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Dukes still keep silent, but everyone knows that the Duke of the Wolf is the Lord of Richard, and Richard’s attitude towards this war is so strong. The wrist is so ruthless, no one believes that there is no acquiescence behind the Duke of the Wolf, or even support. And the other duke, Hamilton, who has a secret covenant with the Duke of the Wolf, has always been able to fall to Richard on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the former enemy of the Duke of the Wolf, the Duke of Glasgow, although his direct vassals are neutral, but some of the peripheral vassals have joined the coalition, The relationship between the royal family and the Duke is also impossible to clarify. But the Duke seemed to be very embarrassed at the moment. He was a very important member of his family, and he did not know why he suddenly became the loyalty of Richard. Psychologists have made various speculations about this, but it seems ridiculous. But in any case, the one hundred eagle flag knights in the Richard army sequence are real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only six field aristocrats left in the coalition camp of the Masters Association, with less than 20,000 troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan almost red-eyed, and the royal family finally gave him a glimmer of hope, breaking the long silence, and supporting the 3,000 kingdom knights. The royal family’s clear statement came a little late, and it hardly affected the aristocrats who had already stood up. The entire Sequoia kingdom was waiting for the arrival of the last battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Ryan personally went on battle, leading the 22,000-strong army and Richard’s 20,000 troops to a decisive battle in the Red River Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saranwell once said that with the same military power, he did not have a little confidence to defeat Richard. Ryan is a genius in magic, but in the lead battle, he can't be compared with Saranwell who has proved himself in dozens of big and small wars. To be exact, the two people are not at one level at all. But Ryan himself never thought so. He thought that magic is above all else. The magical genius has already understood the truth of the world, so there is no such thing as being able to live with him. So Ryan suddenly led the same military and Richard's decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, because of the presence of the humanoid knight in Richard’s army, Ryan’s de facto military strength is still at a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a battle in the Red River Valley, and Lane stared at Richard’s iron-ridden army, and he smashed through his entire front with a surprise attack! The Knights of the Kingdom, which had been placed high hopes, collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outcome of the entire campaign was decided in the first assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, however, the Countess Ekaterina was in the forefront of this campaign. The countess took the chariot and went into battle. She is tall and plump, her skin is white and delicate, and her appearance is a kind of flamboyant beauty. Although she is nearly thirty, she looks like she is only in her early twenties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess led the entire army and deployed it on Richard’s left wing. Richard had just pierced Ryan’s Chinese army, and the countess had already defeated Ryan’s right wing. Then in the scream of the countess's high-pitched singer, the five thousand army, such as the tiger, went down the mountain and went all the way, directly cutting off the back road of the entire coalition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan is incompetent. When he sees the Piaget’s pioneer and Richard’s iron ride together, he knows that the trend has gone. He is also a fierce and decisive person, even directly opened the portal and fled from the battlefield with random transmission! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of the Red River Valley ended in the overall defeat of the coalition forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides of this coalition have two Sanctuary strongmen and the Great Magisters. The 22,000-strong coalition army killed more than 8,000 and was captured by 10,000. And the three thousand kingdom knights all died, even a prisoner did not! At this point, the greatest pillar of the Sequoia Kingdom, the power of the Knights of the Kingdom has been eliminated by two-thirds. The status of the royal family is already at stake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard paid the lives of nearly four thousand soldiers, he defeated all his enemies in one fell swoop. The biggest gain was the killing of the kingdom knight. Reorganized elite troops. If it is not on this special occasion, if it is on the official battlefield, the kingdom stepping army and the battle mage group will cooperate with the kingdom knight. Even if Richard can still defeat them, it is difficult to increase the difficulty. Need to pay a higher price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Richard has become one of the largest real power figures in the Sequoia Kingdom, with the three major dukes. After the continuous death of the King Sequoia King, the strength has not been much stronger than any of the three Dukes. The structure of the Sequoia Kingdom has created a crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the decisive battle, Ryan did not know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Theodore, the president of the Masters Association, regained power, and he first arrested two of the Great Magisters of the Ryan School as a condition to seek and Li Check peace talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hoover Magisters, although the magic of the 18th level is proud of the group, but wisely chose to silently. He is so powerful that he can't compete against Richard's army with one person. Even if there is a magic tower to be able to defend, but there is no need for Richard to fight with him, and the siege will cut off the supply, which is enough to make him defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s hand-held artifacts, and the news of the two great magisters including Zaku in the decisive battle, gradually spread. This makes Hoover, who is very self-satisfied, have to swallow. It turns out that Ryan’s previous speculation is wrong. What can be used to equip his disciples with artifacts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the olive branch that Theodore extended, Richard made two requests. First, the Masters Association gave up the franchise of magic equipment, and Richard was free to dump magic equipment in the Sequoia Kingdom. The second is the identity of the Masters Association to the Richard Dark Master. Richard can arbitrarily hire members of the Masters Association, and the Master of Richard's Master enjoys the same treatment as the members of the Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not think that the president of the Masters Association would agree to this request, but did not expect that Theodore actually promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
