Only now, her smile is no longer flattering and tempting, but rather a horrible horror that can't be said, and it also makes people feel a vaguely helpless grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...it's hard to see now, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not expect her In a word, it would be this, so he hesitated, and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha! Your magicians are really boring guys." Sinclair laughed at himself and said, "I still want to live, I can surrender." My body is very special, as long as I give time, I can slowly return to a good state. So there is no need to worry about combat effectiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say: "I have never worried about combat effectiveness. But you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee reached out and asked Oral, who knew the most about it, to hand it immediately. Short knife. The short knife was accidentally heavy and cold, and immediately rushed out of the grip after the start. The monthly force left in the body of Li has been left alone, and a cold wave is used to immediately pull out a spray, and the coldness is spurred by the surging monthly force, which turns into a cool stream of water, scattered into the body of Richard, let him The spirit is a vibration. Richard was a bit surprised, only to notice that the short knife that the Elf poet handed to himself was one of Sinclair's double knives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took the knife in hand and said to Cinclair: "Some hatred can't be resolved. However, if you are willing to tell me why you came here, There are also some things in the Schumpeter family. I can't dismantle the structure on your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the dismantling of the structure, Sinclair can't help but gently Trembling. Her makeup is not a plug-in, it is implanted directly into the body. After dismantling the structure, her body will be completely unrecognizable. Cinclair didn't want to die, but he was not afraid of death, but he died in the hands of a builder, but it was never a good ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spoke intermittently about the three family unions, offering sacrifices to the Eternal and Time Dragon, thus replacing the coordinates of the target plane of Richard. Although the sacrifices are also very precious, the effects of being able to choose due to various rules are limited. They could not transfer Richard to a plane that established a stable channel, nor could it change the basic nature of the Richard transmission plane, and only limitedly modified it. For example, to raise the upper limit of the plane strength, for example, to modify the destination to another known coordinate but not yet numbered. Only the end result is that everyone expects that both sides have transmitted an unknown plane Faro, and the plane strength is actually above the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission of Sinclair’s arrival is to kill Richard, and the transmission cost of such a large team is shared by the three families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair’s words verified Richard’s previous speculation, and then he held the last line of hope to ask: “Do you have a return to Noland’s coordinates? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair smiled and said, "If there is, I have already gone back. I found out what this level of plane means, you should be very clear." Unfortunately, when I arrived through the portal, the time lighthouse was extinguished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and finally asked: "What else do you have to say?" ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
