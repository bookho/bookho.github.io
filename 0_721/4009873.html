			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long knife pierced the room wall silently until it hit the knife The handle protector stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha still maintains the position of the thorn in front of the knife, and the sigh of relief in the chest has finally spit out. Then the huge feeling of fatigue immediately rushed, almost drowning his consciousness, sweat as a flash flood, and instantly soaked all the clothes. Richard almost collapsed. If he didn't hold the handle, he might not stand still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple two swords, but condensed all his efforts, forced all potential between life and death, and also exhausted almost the last drop Physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the door was knocked open, Gangde had already rushed in, and the water splashed into the room even earlier than him, silently affixing the wall Standing. The two looked at the bedroom that was already in amazement. They didn't understand what happened. They both looked at the window in unison. It was the only exit, but the window was half open and the curtains were not pulled up. Everything was intact. It is not lossless, nor does it look like an enemy has gone from there and has not seen the shadow of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand quickly followed the room and looked around, and his face changed slightly. She knelt down, looked at the inconspicuous scratches on the floor, and reached out and touched it. The traces of the claws that resemble the beasts are the ones left by the shadow leopard. There is still a trace of residual shadow power at the moment, but it is clearly captured by the flowing sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow Creature?" Flowing sand asks, the sound is rare and dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, then slowly bowed his head and looked at his chest. The clothes on his chest had split open, revealing three long cracks. Under the crack, a thin red line began to appear on the bare skin, and then separated to reveal the flesh and blood below. The incision is extremely smooth and flat, and it continues to penetrate deep into the body until it reveals the root ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the blood splatters out, and Richard falls down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard woke up, it was already a day later. He lay back on the bed, his chest was tightly wrapped, and the neat and tight bandage did not bring much pressure, showing a very professional approach, apparently only from the hand of the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha moved a little, and there was a sting in the wound on his chest. He had no choice but to lie back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another headache characteristic of the shadow creature, the resistance of the gods. Damaged by shadow creatures, the wounds are accompanied by a large amount of shadow power, which can offset the magical power of healing the gods, and greatly reduce the therapeutic effect of the powerful treatment. The wound left by the high-order shadow creature can even make the magic completely ineffective, unless there is a way to dispel the power of the shadow, otherwise it will only dissipate the natural force of the shadow. At this time, we can only rely on grass drugs with low efficacy and the natural healing function of the human body. So many people who are seriously injured by shadow creatures are helpless, or they are disabled because they cannot get timely treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a faint skylight in the room, now it is just dawn, the window is quiet, people are mostly asleep in their dreams. Anyway, Li couldn’t move, but he remembered the thrilling battle with the shadowed leopard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow creatures have no entities, they rely on the power of shadows to move forward and backward, so there is no need to squat before the fight like a normal beast. Therefore, its crouching action is completely confusing the opponent, in fact, the crouching is the beginning of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
