			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most of the slave groups chose not to pay taxes, or even In the case of a cavalry patrol that is inspected for taxation, it will also openly fight. In just one month, there were six cavalry patrols, and hundreds of cavalry were killed by slaves. The slave squad is extremely savvy, and once it is done, it often does not leave alive. Even a large group of slaves attacked a taxation base in Richard, killing hundreds of people who even the tax collectors to the guards, and one did not stay. The body was stripped on the stake and stood around the tax collection point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Richard’s remaining five tax collection points in the Northwest Territories are in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slaves are all dead guys. They have always been the source of instability, and they are extremely ferocious and bloodthirsty. The years of desperate life have made these masters of slavery unruly, and it is difficult for them to obey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Gangde and the combat priest are not the main blame, the former is from the death camp, and the murder is commonplace. The latter is standing on the position of God. It is believed that the infidels who disobeyed disobedience are responsible for God, so they are even more fanatical than Gangde. Although the two people's starting points are completely different, they are highly consistent in their attitude towards the enemy. That is tough attack and never tolerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel even shouted out that he would rather kill a thousand and never let go of a slogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Gund and Io brought a 500-person knight to start the area of ​​the Northwest Slaughter Group. Gangde released the news early, and all the people who saw the slaves saw him, they must be disarmed immediately, and all of them received a thorough search. Anyone who does not let go of his weapons, or even a group of slaves who have laid down their weapons, will kill them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Io’s theory is that as long as there are slaves here, there will be no shortage of slaves, killing this group, and there will be A batch. This is his theory of carrion: there is carrion, and there will always be flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This command full of domineering and cruelty immediately provoked an uproar in the Iron Triangle Empire and even the Sequoia Kingdom, against the voice of Richard. Most of the slave squads are backed by aristocrats from all over the world. Resisting the tax collection by Richard is actually inspired by the aristocrats behind the scenes. In fact, the tax collected by Li is not heavy, but the whole piece of blood-stained land is added together, and the interest has reached an astronomical figure, enough for anyone to be jealous. Therefore, many nobles secretly wished that the investigation was unlucky. A little better thought that Li had received enough money. It is not a problem to reduce this tax. Even darker, I hope that Richard’s rule in the bloody land will collapse, or at least not stable enough, so that they can also put a foot in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood-stained land is too big, and almost no one wants to see the extent of Richard’s monopoly. Only these nobles have forgotten that Richard came to Faro for more than two years. Before Richard, the blood-stained land existed for many years. At that time, the blood-stained land was not fat at all, but a terrible zone where only the desperate and the adventurer dared to go deep. Such as the strength of Marquis Anlik can be inserted in the blue water oasis, is already the limit that the nobility can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles have ignored the blood-stained land that no one has been able to squat for years, but they have been successfully raided by Richard in two years and have defeated the Iron Triangle Empire. Joint army with the Masters Association. The nobles were even more afraid of the aliens who had been entrenched in the bloody land, but they were not very afraid of Richard, although the former was almost uprooted by the latter. This is also in line with the general psychology of human beings, that is, to be more awe of unfamiliar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the aristocrats are at the moment, the two war madmen of Gangde and Iguo started to act according to their own plans. On the first day, they encountered three slavery groups, three of which were not exporting and were rebellious. After all, there are not enough knights in Gangde, and the five hundred knights are just a few more horses. The fierce horses will also detour when they encounter the slave group. But the five hundred cavalry, and five hundred knights, the difference is essentially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the first day, Gangde fought three battles, killing more than 700 people in the slavery, more than forty casualties, and robbing thousands A foreign slave. The next day, around the tax collection point that was removed, there were more than 700 wooden stakes, all of which were nailed with the slaves and the compatriots who died in the tax collection point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the situation is like a wing, it instantly spreads around the country around the bloody land. One of the three slavery groups was the Marquis of the Sequoia Kingdom. His angry ambassador sent a messenger to the Blue Water Oasis City to protest, but the messenger was put on the hotel. Regardless of whether Gangde or Io is fighting outside, how can I go back to Oasis City in order to see the marquis of the Marquis? This messenger is naturally angry, but he has no choice but to wait for the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Gangde intercepted two small-scale snatching groups. They are all behind-the-scenes supporters and have been honestly registered. The tax is therefore safe to pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the calm days only took less than a week, and Gangde met the biggest challenge, a soldier of nearly four hundred, and a sanctuary strongman Snatching group, killer whales! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two sides met, the fierce battle broke out without suspense. This killing was extremely fierce. Gangde himself injured as many as a dozen. The most important thing was that the abdomen was deeply stabbed. The number of slave-striking soldiers who died under the giant axe was more than forty, and this was the result of Gangde’s battle with the other sanctuary for most of the time. For the first time, the combat priests exhausted their power when the battle was not over. Then he waved the scepter that could be used as a chain and smashed the heads of at least a dozen enemy soldiers. The fighting priest was not afraid of close combat, and he had suffered two big losses under Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle reached the second half, the mother's nest finally sent orders from the turbulent land, directly taking over the manipulation of the humanoid knight. So the shocking scene happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of humanoid knights rushed to each other's sanctuary strong, they did not care about the pain, and did not dodge the attack, only ask Insert the giant sword of the axe in the handle into the body of the sanctuary! Until this moment, the humanoid knights really revealed their terrible, these are killing machines that are not afraid at all, nor care about the pain. The whole meaning of their existence is to send the weapons in their hands to the enemy's body. Even if the strong willer is determined, the body will instinctively respond to the pain, but at this moment, the mother's nest directly cut off the pain of the humanoid knight! No matter how terrible the wounds are cut out on the humanoid knight, it is like cutting on the wood, without affecting their actions of rushing and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when some humanoid knights are cutting axe, large internal organs are ejected from the wound under the ribs! However, their action of falling axe is not deformed and the strength is not weakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such an enemy, even the most determined strong will sooner or later collapse and go crazy. The sanctuary strongman only persisted for a while, the spirit has collapsed, and the madness entered the final madness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Sanctuary finally fell, he had at least 30 wounds on his body, and there were more than a dozen axe guns on him. Stud him into a hedgehog. Around him, there were more than 30 human-shaped knights, almost piled up into a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
