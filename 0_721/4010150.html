			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread a piece of paper on the table with a vertical line in the middle Then write on the left: a whole level of permanent magic, serious injury, let the opponent understand their own strength, the next time you can specifically set the trap or direct strong blow, revealing the dilemma of Archimonde no strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small habit of Richard. Every time before or after a major event, he will write down the gains and losses clearly, so that he can think more clearly about the gains and losses. . The left column is the price paid, and the right side is the harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the right, he thought for a long time, but wrote a few words: very cool! Maintained the dignity of Archimonde and smoked the two old guys of Mensa and Schumpeter! Killed two nuisances! Stripped a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seriously thought about it, and then divided some of the words, and finally left the article to maintain the dignity of Archimonde. The other items, in the view of Richard, are nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he hesitated, but kept the word ‘very cool’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in the end, looking at the paper, Richard was shaking his head and smiling. He found that after paying a huge price, the harvest seemed to be pitiful. Only if you maintain the dignity of Archimonde, or may have a potential return in the future, but who knows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed and said to himself: "The big loss!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪静静Standing in the study room. When she heard Richard’s self-talk, the expression on her face immediately twitched, and she recovered her coldness and pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked up and looked at Qi Qi, frowning: "What are you still standing there? Take off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪's hands trembled slightly, but succeeded in keeping his expression calm as water. So in front of Richard, she raised her hands, slowly but as elegantly as possible to unbutton a button, loosen a ribbon, long skirt, petticoat, underwear one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last piece of clothing landed, she stepped forward and stood barefoot on the floor, just standing in front of Richard. Her face was still calm, but her body was terribly nervous, and every line was tight. Although the female body was more perfect, she sold her cold face. One hand is involuntarily raised, and the vital zone of the lower abdomen of the chest is protected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie leaned on the back of the chair, holding red wine in his hand, and casually savoring his mind, his mind was no longer in the wine, but in front of it was white Young **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi’s figure is as perfect as her appearance. After she has been shackled, she has a pair of full-bodied milk/peaks, with a hint of peaks. Pink. And her waist is very thin, and the towering double peaks form a striking contrast, and then down, over the raised belly, is a pair of slender legs, barefoot and her hands are as long and soft, a little bit of nails are also faint Soft powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is all over the body, and every part of the body makes people want to bite a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only felt that there was a fierce flame in his body, and the male instinct was even more eager to suppress. The male weapon is even harder to make him uncomfortable. Richard had to admit that Qi Qi is a girl with special meaning and taste. It is the top level of the women she has seen in terms of looks and body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this age of power, her individual strength is negligible, but she can become the pearl of the Mensa family, and there is a plane named after her, which shows the amazing charm of Qi Qi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Richard, Qi Qi has an extra deadly appeal. She is the pearl of the death of the Mensa family, the perfect lover in countless young Mensa dreams. She is also the fiancee of the Duke of Dario, the patriarch of the Xiong Peter family. These two identities have made Richard aware of her impulses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had some pity that he should be free to dispose of her in the bet, perhaps simply let her come over. At that time, Mensa had a high probability of agreeing to this request, because in the plan of Xiaomensa, there was no possibility of losing. The only thing they worried about was whether Richard would hold back the duel and sit on Winnington’s death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington is a good young man, but that's it. He may have a good accomplishment in the future, but it is impossible to reverse the fate of the entire family like Richard. So in the eyes of the Duke of Mensa, even if the Akmen family elders decided, Winnington could be abandoned. The nobility has never been a fine tradition of sacrifice for blood, not to mention that Winnington and Richard are not the same mother, and his total value lies only in the dignity of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sipped a sip of red wine and said to Qi Qi: "Put your hands down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞Qi hesitated, and put a hand down and involuntarily retracted it. With Richard's sharp vision, she could even see the fine fluff on her body surface erected at the root! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Qi Qi seems to know his fate, and finally put his hands down, so that all the parts are exposed to Richard. Richard stood up, walked to Qi Qi, looked at her at the nearest distance, then reached out and picked up her chin and asked, "Do you know how I feel now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪 tilted his head and said in a calm and indifferent voice: "Know. Every time you touch me, it is equivalent to giving a slap in the face of the two old guys of Mensa and Schumpeter."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer is so shockingly accurate that even though Richard looked at her eyes, there was a slight difference, and then said: "The answer is really too / he / mother is correct. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand that Richard picked up her jaw gradually went down and climbed up the curve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi suddenly shocked and suddenly bit his lower lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at her beautiful dark blue eyes, but her hand continued to move down, slowly saying: "This way of slapping, no matter how much It won't be impatient. However, don't you want to resist or protest? Now it doesn't seem to be the content of the bet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞琪默默默With the touch of Richard, he suddenly chilled and finally sighed and said, "I know, but I know more about what you want to do. I don't want that."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Richard stopped the action on his hand and asked with interest: "Talk about it, what step do I want to do? If you guessed it, then the bet is even Finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi gently biting her lower lip and looking at Richard with a complicated look, finally made up her mind and said, "I heard about Winnie. The card thing. After the gambling game was lost, she...had to let them see clearly according to the requirements, so they had to put up various postures. And they needed to do it themselves to show some parts....I don’t . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp such "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Richard’s heart touched slightly. Qi Qi and Venica actually have similar places, and they are trying to resist. They only choose their own way, one is active and the other is passive. One would rather endure humiliation than let the other person touch one finger, and the other would not want to let Richard enjoy the spirit of conquest in any way. In any case, in the desperate struggle between the two huge families, young girls like them tend to fall into tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus has a basic rule of iron, which is considered a paradise in hell. After the duel, the performance of the Duke of Mensa and his brother was extremely abnormal, but it was because of the power and danger of Richard. If the weak are able to get the protection of the rules, people simply do not bother to destroy the rules for them, but are more willing to gain the reputation of honor and credibility. The reputation of this kind of thing, in the eyes of short-sighted guys, is of no use, but no family with no reputation, but no one can go very far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s outside of Favord, Venica can’t be retired, and Qi Qi is the same. Compared with the disappearance of more lives in the family war, their encounters can only be regarded as cloudless, and nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been smelted in the war of plane war for more than a year, and this kind of thing can only slightly make his mood fluctuate. However, Richard still admits that Qi Qi is a special one wherever he is. Looking at it from another angle, she wears, or does not wear, it is also a special one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you guessed my mind, so it’s already a gamble, you can put on your clothes." Richard waved his hand and said Two steps back, one ass sat on the edge of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was a slap in the face, but she is still a must-see for wearing clothes, Richard is not going to let go. The importance of real talents is fully demonstrated at this moment. Every picture that Richard sees can be easily restored in consciousness. Even if he is willing, Richard, who has masters in painting, can draw any scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;珞 Qi’s movements are calm and elegant, just like no one around, completely treating Richard as the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Qi Qi wearing the last dress, Richard shrugged with regret, and suddenly regretted it. But for the sake of face, of course he will not say the mood at the moment. On the other hand, it is the purpose of Richard to attack Mensa and Schumpeter through Qi Qi, but he thinks that the matter itself is of little value. This can be seen from the harvest listed on the piece of paper still on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Richard has to admit that Qi Qi itself is already a very valuable harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a few strokes on paper and roughly estimated that it would take less than a month to recover to level 12, but to break through to thirteen The level is still about a year. But this is the case when the full supply of the magic star blood, Richard now needs to calculate how long it will take if you fully upgrade the magic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem that is not too complicated, but it also requires paper and pen because it involves the probability of different levels of starburst and the probability of being captured. And the simple calculation of the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly sketched out the sketch of the calculation magic circle in his mind, and was preparing to write the pen, suddenly remembering that Qi Qi was still in the study. He looked up and the girl was quietly standing in the corner of the study, watching him with his dark blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his brow and said: "You still don't go back, do you want me to send you? Or do you want something to happen between us?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
