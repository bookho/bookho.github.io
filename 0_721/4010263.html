The rest are all big aristocrats with strong strength, even the Grand Duchy. And within the Sequoia Kingdom, there has been more and more opposition to the rapid expansion of the Duke of the Wolf. The Duke of the Wolf, led by a duke, is about to fight the entire White Rock Principality. If you really let him swallow the Principality of White Rock, then the most threatened is the royal family of the Sequoia Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, the King Sequoia King’s room jumped out to support the Magic Association semi-publicly. It is impossible to say that there are factors that want to contain the Duke of the Wolf through Richard. I just didn't expect Richard's strength to be strong enough to win the war almost by himself. Instead, he took the power of the royal family a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Duke of the Wolf is such a hero, in the face of such an unsolvable situation, I feel deeply tired and powerless. This time his luck is good enough, then next time, next time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard did not directly answer the question of the Duke of the Wolf, but said: "Now I can confirm that Palin’s problem is the god of time. The god of Sinai directly leads."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the implication of this sentence is that if you want to completely solve the plight of Palin, you can let Sinai take back the gods. And this has not been precedent in history. Either simply push Sinai down the altar. The latter was originally only in the delusion of the madman, but with the arrival of Richard, the Duke of the Wolf saw a glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end is to be enemies with God...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke thinks, but the heart is gradually clam down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while looking at the dark nights at his feet, he was thinking about who his enemies were. It seems that his enemies are very, very much, and it can even be said that everyone in a strange plane is his own enemy. In Noland, Richard also has many enemies inherited from Gordon, such as Schumpeter, such as Mensa, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly thought of Gordon. The man’s enemies seem to be countless, and he spent the rest of his life in war and expansion. However, when Gotton entered the volcano with only thirteen rides, when Richard disappeared, Gordon resolutely fought at the same time with the four giants. When each battle was won, when the man borrowed from Su Hailun indifferently. When the next astronomical debt was settled, Richard finally understood that the man had never put these so-called enemies in his heart from the beginning. To Gordon, the enemies in the eyes of the world are just a little trouble on his way. No one knows where this man's heart is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gaze is long-term, the real enemy of Richard seems to be in Calando, and there seems to be a huge shadow over the holy temple of the big snowy mountain. Peeking at the mountains and the sea; his enemies also seem to be deep in the plane, and I don’t know where to go, and I can never destroy the clean shadow biota. His enemies are deeper behind time, and they can make Su Helun, like the omnipotent, drift forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the whole world seemed to be no longer true. His consciousness is lingering between the real and the illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie’s eyes closed, and then opened again, and between the ones, the eyes were deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is separated by the opposite, not his enemy, but just a little trouble on his way to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a quiet and peaceful night, and the wind was soft. But when it passed through many busy fighters, it has quietly brought murder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stone tower suddenly came a dense footstep, the guards under the tower called: "Duke of Glasgow! Countess Ekaterina!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the Duke of Glasgow in black armor appeared at the top of the tower, behind him, the Countess Ekaterina. Tonight, the countess took off her long skirt and once again put on a beautifully crafted lock, which added a touch of heroic and murderous, and the imposing manner was hardly weaker than the Duke of Glasgow. Anna, behind her, was completely suppressed by the countess at this time, and she looked dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this is the true face of the countess. How can a woman who only knows how to find a man to go to bed can build such an elite army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow was the first time to meet. The Duke of Glasgow had a deep heart and was always the opposite of the Duke of the Wolf. However, this time the Duke of Glasgow almost took out two-thirds of all the troops. More than 10,000 people have arrived on the battlefield, and there are 10,000 reinforcements. And I will be there soon. Judging from this number, all the elites in the Duke’s hands have entered the battle, making Richard a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow is tall and thin, with a white hair combing meticulously, and every wrinkle on the face is as deep as a knife. Similar to the Duke of the Wolf, he also has a pair of wolf-like eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Viscount sent a message from the Territory claiming that the army of the Duke of Glasgow would also join the Lieutenant Army, Richard originally thought that the Duke would only send troops. Come over, but did not expect the Duke himself to come in person. So I took a step and smiled and said, "Hello, you are really surprised by your arrival."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow faintly said, " Hem stayed on the territory. I came here and he can be honest at home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li smiled and expressed understanding. Blood reproduction is a top priority for any family. The war of intruders is too dangerous. The facts have proved that even the strongest people in the town will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow took another look at the duke of the wolf, silently saying, "Why, I am two old guys with Billi in the Kingdom now." Also, I can play it. In addition, I have put all my family on you, of course, I have to come and see for myself to be assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;李察下石塔One finger, smiled and said: "Now, do you look at it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow stands by the side of the stone tower and looks around for a week. Seeing the layout of the defensive positions from the distribution of the fire, the eyes were stretched slightly and said, "You have never been disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smile and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the Duke of Glasgow swept over the crowd at the top of the stone tower. Almost every time someone saw a person, the corner of his eye jumped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf is an old rival. Both of them are national powerhouses of the Faro Town. Whether they are leading or personal, they fight more than once, and at the same time It is said that they are very familiar with each other. However, at this time, the Duke of Glasgow felt that there was a strange feeling in the Duke of the Wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few followers of Richard, one of them is not very high, but they all give him a feeling of being threatened. Finally, when the eyes of the Duke of Glasgow fell on a female mage wearing a metal mask behind Richard, the pupil suddenly shrank, and his eyes were like needles, so that he immediately closed his eyes, and the two lines of tears involuntarily Flowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Duke of the Wolf said: "Old friends, we can't look at the people around Richard with our past eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Glasgow took a breath, opened his eyes and nodded. His eyes are already bloodshot and instantly become red. This is the secret of the Duke of Glasgow, which can be used to detect the strength of the opponent. This kind of mystery is more overbearing and more precise than that of the Duke of the Wolf. The price is that once the person whose strength is above himself is detected, it will be countered unrelentingly. Fortunately, the Duke of Glasgow's detection was not hostile, and the other side did not mean to fight back, so only the eyes were slightly injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the god, the Duke of Glasgow said: "Actually, I also brought a very bad news this time. The royal expeditionary army and several others The coalition forces formed by the Expeditionary Forces of the Principality carried out a second decisive battle with the invaders this morning. As a result, under the First World War, the coalition forces with absolute superiority were completely annihilated, and the five great magisters of the Crown Prince and the Masters Association of the Sequoia Kingdom. All died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal family has always stood in the same camp as the Duke of Glasgow, and has been suppressing the Duke of the Wolf. But when I heard this news, the Duke of the Wolf did not care for the fall of the opponent, but a chill in the bottom of my heart. Although the royal expeditionary army is not large, it is absolutely elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are there in the coalition?" The Duke of the Wolf couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"70,000." The Duke of Glasgow smiled and said this number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dusk of the Duke of the Wolf suddenly locks up and the voice becomes a bit dry: "The 70,000 army, the whole army is annihilated? The invaders were not yesterday and the Baroque king." **A bloody battle?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the Duke of the Wolf Unprecedented and heavy. The invaders first defeated the well-prepared 100,000 Baroque coalition forces in one fell swoop, almost smashing the township powerhouses of the Baroque kingdom. Then, after only one night's rest, I went straight to the army and smashed the army several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result also reveals a creepy horror fact. Be aware that on the battlefield, it is much more difficult to defeat an army than to defeat it. Once the war damage has reached a certain proportion, the disciplined and strict army will be broken, especially for the coalition-type team, the ratio will be lower. Therefore, there is only one possibility, that is, the time of engagement between the two armies is quite short, that is to say, the intruder has an overwhelming advantage of force, and even does not form a tug-of-war, which will make the big magician, a personal powerhouse who can leave the battlefield autonomously, There are no opportunities to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the martial arts, how to block? In front of the intruders, although the country is full of hundreds of kilometers, but the elite forces have been exhausted in the two battles before and after, the invaders of the military front, can be said to be the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in front of the intruder, it is the strongest force of Richard’s assembly. Between Richard and the invaders, the military power of the small Principalities may not be able to delay the intruders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people are there in the intruder?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
