			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book contains three bursting fireballs and two natural summons. In a month's time, Richard increased his magic power by meditation and increased the magic power of a whole four hundred units. Now he even released a seven-level magic with sacrifice. As long as there is no extra sacrifice power, he will not drop the magic level. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this month, in addition to the final feeling of sorrow in the quicksand, Richard completed two sets of suits. The seven horse riding industry created by the mother's nest has arrived in Oasis City. With the ride, there is a knight. Richard selected five 12-level Archimonde fighters and formed his first team of knights. These five suits, the knights, have the equivalent of fifteenth level. And Richard took them to the teeth with all-round equipment, and then he stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is everything at the moment, only one head of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bark of Chuckert rushed into Oasis, he did not know that he was about to become a fuse of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chakter saw Richard, Richard’s mood looked very good, in stark contrast to the Baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly have a reason to be in a good mood. In the past month, his effect in meditation was exceptionally good, and the speed of magic improvement was almost double that of the past. In other words, in the past month, Richard's magic has increased eight to ten times faster than the average Master. The main reason for the rapid increase in magic is that the probability of high-order starburst is higher than in the past. This allowed Richard to decide to continue to cultivate the magic star blood in the next period of time, and must look at what happens when the fourth order is taken. In addition, wisdom and real talent play an important role in capturing starbursts. And at least Richard found a way to improve his talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Chakter sitting opposite Richard is a servant, his hair is dirty and messy, sticking together, and his eyes are covered with bloodshot eyes. It seems that I have not slept well in the past few nights. Compared with the last time he left, he was thinner and more awkward. He was not seen for a few months, just like he was ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chucker subconsciously rubbed his hands and said with some nervous voice: "Mr. Richard, you must help me! Otherwise my father, my The family is over!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha first told the person to bring in a cup of black tea, which added a little spirits to make Chakter quietly, saying: Don't worry, Chakter. There is something to say slowly, you are here, it is safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chucker really seems to relax, smile Said: "Li Cha, the family disaster, is actually caused by the magic equipment you gave me ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck It was messy to say, but after a while, Richard understood the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the original magical equipment that Chuckert gave to the Earl of Burr was discovered by the Masters Association, the Masters Association had secretly contacted the Count of Burr several times. They privately promised that if Earl Burr admits that it is illegal to buy magical equipment from Richard, then the Masters Association will no longer hold the Earl's responsibility in this incident, but will point the finger at Richard. If Earl of Burr is willing to cooperate with the Masters Association to accuse Richard, then the Masters Association promises not only to return the magical equipment worth more than 100,000 gold coins, but also to give certain discounts when supplying equipment to the Piaget in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the double temptation and silent threat, Earl Burr finally could not resist, admitting that he violated the rules of the Masters Association, acquired a large amount of magic equipment from Richard, and wrote written materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the Masters Association became completely silent, but did not return the magic equipment that was collected. Earl Burr was upset in his heart. After thinking about it, he still didn't dare to ask the Master Association. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just a week ago, more than a dozen black robe law enforcement mages from the Masters Association raided the Earl of Burr with the assistance of hundreds of elite knights. The castle, captured the count, and occupied the castle. Earl of Burr was taken to Lausanne, where the headquarters of the Masters Association was located, and was placed in the secret law prison. The confession statement compromised by the Earl and the Masters Association is now the most powerful weapon for judging him. It is worth pondering that the name of the supplier of the illegal transaction was hidden in the judgment of the Masters Association, and there was no positive mention of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news came out, the whole Sequoia kingdom was in vain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tough action of the Masters Association makes all the local aristocrats uneasy and angry, and the voice of condemnation is endless. If you want to try and punish a real aristocrat, it is still such a real big aristocrat who belongs to the rank of the Earl, that is, the king cannot do it at will. The Masters Association made it, although they have good excuses, but the nobles still have to ask who is giving them such rights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Earl of Burr is a neutral aristocracy and does not belong to any of the royal family and the three great dukes. In peacetime, this allowed him to avoid the conflict between the giants, but now, he also found that he did not have strong and powerful allies around him in times of crisis. And in this matter, I do not know why, the royal family and the three Dukes have surprisingly kept silent. Other nobles just constantly put pressure on the Masters Association to protest, but the attitude of the Masters Association is surprisingly tough and will not respond. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there are no organizers, the protests of the nobles are imposing, but no one really wants to jump out and fight a war with the Magi. Therefore, public opinion is once again a huge momentum. In fact, it can only be lost in the end. Let the Earl of Burr be tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Richard asked: "What will be the result of the trial?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best result is to confiscate the magic equipment and pay a large sum of money." Chakter smiled and hesitated, and then said: "The worst result... is imprisonment, even hanged." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately frowned and said, "Hanged? Does the Master Association have such rights? Even the King has no right to kill an Earl at will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Theoretically, but in fact there are many alternatives. For example, secretly executed in a secret prison, then said to die from physical discomfort, or It’s older, and it’s even suicide. There are so many means.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll think about it, and I’ll understand that the Master’s Association will probably use this. The way, at least to the other nobles a piece of fig leaf, even if the piece of cloth is really small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about the territory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chucker spread his hands and said: "Segmentation, Then gradually eat into the whale swallow, that's it." The family's parents are trapped in such an infamous death, and the successor's ability is stronger, I am afraid it is difficult to fully protect the original interests. The Masters Association will certainly not let the Piages be firmly grasped by the next one. Splitting and inheriting is the most likely situation. In this process, the family chaos plus external erosion, the Earl's collar will no longer exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard nodded, picked up the black tea, and sipped it lightly, and said nothing: "I can help you with this incident. But do you really have the courage to be an enemy of the Masters Association? I mean... war! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuckert was shocked first, and looked a little scared. Then he calmed down and his face gradually became gloomy and decided. He was dumb and sly, and said: "Done! If all the mobilization of my territory, I can pull out two thousand soldiers! Only one thousand of them can really fight, and the other one is not equipped, and the training is not In place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha knows that mobilizing two thousand people is definitely a nesting for a baron, so he said, "Well, go back and assemble the army. When did you get together two thousand people, when will I intervene in this matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaquet Baron Huo Di stood up and said: "One week I will assemble the army in a week!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a map of the blood-stained land and pointed to the territory he was still building. Said: "Very good. This is my territory, you will gather the troops here. I will join you after a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaquet Baron suddenly On one knee, he gave a tribute to the lord's courtesy, and then strode away from the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire process, the sand has been quietly watching and listening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is walking back and forth in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha said: "It’s a bit strange. The Masters Association did this. In fact, it’s the biggest blow to the royal family and the three Dukes. This is the challenge to Wang Quanchi/naked/naked. Why are they all silent? There must be a reason behind this, but we can ask the Duke of the Wolf. Also, the Masters Association did not directly mention your name, but put the Barker Chakter back." If there is no Master The association secretly released water, and with the speed and strength of their arrest of Earl Burr, it was impossible for the Chakte Baron to leave the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "It seems that the Masters Association is more difficult to deal with than we originally expected. But there is nothing to guess, nothing more. It is intended to drag me into the water. As for the royal family, I think it is possible that the Masters Association has discussed with them and prepared to divide the interests of my blood-stained land. The interest of this business road is one year. Ten million levels of measurement! And the majesty of the kingship, after the event can be used to maintain the remedy with a joint statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said, "What can I do? Let’s play it first! Anyway, no matter what calculations they have, the war is what we want. After playing on the battlefield, you can know what the Masters Association is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also! The Iona guy is looking forward to it every day. War."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the name of the fighting officer, Richard snorted heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands also snorted, don’t say something: "The battle priests of our eternal dragon temple, at least there is no habit of undressing!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the look of Li, suddenly grabbed the sand and hugged it, dragged it into the bedroom, threw her on the bed, and then rushed up. The sand was struggling to struggle, clamoring, resisting, and finally fell. However, throughout the process, she has never used the sacred fighting technique, or whether Richard can succeed, or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
