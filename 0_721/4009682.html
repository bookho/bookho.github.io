One place is to shorten the spell singing time by half a second. This is the first and most important step in the instant fireball. Because it is not a standard magic speed, it means that Richard's understanding of the relevant magic principle has reached a new height. In the future, if you can complete the magical effect or even the magical effect, then Richard has the iconic magic of the ‘instant fireball’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to carefully organize his appearance in front of the mirror, and those who have the blood of the elves naturally pay attention to their appearance. Today, Richard arranged a special itinerary for himself. He ordered a bouquet of white flowers and prepared to throw it out from the open deck on the upper deck. It is said that the top of the dark blue is close to the trade wind belt. In theory, if these flowers are thrown high enough and luck is good enough, the endless trade wind will send the flowers hundreds of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha hopes that the mother in heaven can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the past, Richard came out of the residential area, holding the ordered bouquet and heading for the magical array that led to the upper level of the dark blue. Sending a magic array can transfer more than a dozen people to a designated floor at a time. It is the most convenient and efficient means of transportation. Of course, expensive is another feature of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard approached the Magic Circle, there were several young magic apprentices standing next to him. There are a few familiar faces in it, and he once went to class with him. Other people have never seen Richard. They seemed to be waiting for something. When Richard walked into the magical array, they seemed to change their minds and squeezed in together. The transmission magic array is not large, and there are several people in it, so it seems a bit crowded. After shaking for a few seconds, the feeling of restraint around the body disappeared, which is a sign of transmission. With the fall of the magic light curtain, Richard has reached the twentieth layer of dark blue. Here he wants to transfer to another transfer magic array to the fortieth floor, so repeated, while the destination large terrace is in the deep blue eighty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Richard stepped out of the light curtain, suddenly there was a sharp pain in his butt, which was actually copied by a man! Unsuspecting, Li, exclaimed, instinctively rushed forward, but his feet were smashed by obstacles. The whole person fell heavily and slipped straight along the black stone surface. Mi, stopped. The pain in the whole body made Richard unable to climb for a moment, and the sudden impact also made his mind a little faint, but the sneer and mockery that broke out behind him made him understand that he was just being played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneak attack of the trick is not the most concerned by Richard, but the bouquet he originally intended to give to his mother was falling over him. When I flew out of the hand and fell off in three or five steps, not only did some of the petals fall, but the bundled stems were completely dispersed. Richard was in a hurry and quickly climbed up and ran over to pick up the bouquet. This is the favorite flower of my mother during her lifetime. It is not a rare species, but it is rare in the north away from the mountain village. He booked the flower shop one month in advance to get it on time today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when his hand was about to touch the bouquet, the other hand took the lead and grabbed the bouquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole body of Richard was stiff and slowly straightened up and looked forward. Standing in front of him is a juvenile mage, about fourteen and five years old. He was half a head taller than Richard, with a look of arrogance and banter, wearing a magic apprentice robes, looking at the bouquet in his hand. He is one of the young apprentices who just waited in front of the transmission line, and now looks like the first one. The other young apprentices were also close to each other in twos and threes, faintly encircling Richard in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard was slow again, and he understood that these people came specifically for him. What I don't understand is that he has been immersed in the world of magic. He has almost no communication with anyone except the lecturer. How can he get rid of them? Richard was able to affirm that he and any of these young apprentices did not say a word. However, the superb memory brought by wisdom made Richard faintly think of the boy named Papan in front of him. It seems that he was born from a certain aristocratic family of the Holy Alliance. He has some magical talents, but in the dark blue, he is not so outstanding. Otherwise, Richard can certainly remember more information. As for the magic level... In the perspective of Richard, Papan’s figure representing the magic is constantly beating. This is the precise talent that measures his magical power according to the magical fluctuations of Papan, and finally stays at the number of 15. So Richard knew that Papan was already a second-level magician, and at least the magic had reached the second level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pappan looked over and over at the messy bouquet in his hand and shook it, not seeing anything more than falling petals and leaves. Come, so he slanted his eyes to Richard, with contempt in arrogance, and asked: "You are the one who is Richard? I really can't see what you have, you can let the great Su Hailun to accept you as a disciple. But say To be honest, your ass is really good!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth apprentices suddenly laughed, they obviously have experience and understand what it means. Even if he has no experience, Richard can read it from their evil eyes. His face swelled red for a moment, but perseverance still made him restrain his anger, saying, "Give me the flowers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Aha, flower! I forgot that there is such a thing!" Papan exclaimed exaggeratedly, and then looked at the bouquet in his hand, and even stretched his tongue to take a heavy sip, saying: " Is this something important to you? Let me guess, must I give it to a woman? I said Xiao Licha, I doubt that if you start to grow up, you will learn from other men. Woman giving flowers? This is very bad. Who are you going to give, or I will help you! Look, I am a very good person, I like to help people! But then, this bunch of flowers is really ugly. "It’s like this." He slammed the bouquet with force, and more petals and leaves fell down. "It’s like a gift to a prostitute..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Give me back!" Richard's voice was very low, like the roar of the lion cub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! You really liked this stuff..." Papan squinted and put his face close to Little Richard, but his hand was loose. The bunch of flowers fell to the ground. Before the reaction was detected, a young apprentice next to him stepped on it and then smashed it a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white petals are scattered all over the place and can no longer be restored. More petals are squatting under the shoes of the young apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of Richard was unexpected. He did not rush to protect the bouquet for the first time, nor did he stop the juvenile apprentice, but the body first backwards. Yang, and then the hard bow like a full pull suddenly bounced back, the hard forehead has been on the face of Papanyou with a smile! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the transmission line is the main thoroughfare, so many people have been gathered together. In addition to the sound of crushed berries, the eyes of the onlookers heard the cracking of the bones of the Kasbah. When I saw this collision, some timid people felt that their noses were a bit sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Papan’s eyes suddenly darkened, and then the line of sight was occupied by red, yellow, and even various colors. The world is spinning, and for a moment, he is unaware of where he is. Just as the teenagers were shocked, Richard had already plunged into Papan, grabbed his hair with both hands, and pulled it with the weight of his body, letting Papan’s body fly, while Richard’s hands were dead and held. His head, smashing the already blurred face to the hard ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as this is solid, Papan's skull will crack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the deep blue of the Master, it is of course impossible to let this evil happen. Two six-level ‘physical immune shields’ appeared on both Richard and Papan, and the repulsive force between the shields caused Richard and Papan to slam the ball together and bounce off the sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least a 14th-level grandmother who can instantly send six levels of magic. Sure enough, two middle-aged mage came over and calmly asked: "How? What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of physical immune shield is very powerful. If you don’t absorb enough damage, you can only wait for the magic time to pass, or be dispelled. It is. Being wrapped in a shield, Richard’s eyes were red, and he was desperately attacking the shield and wanted to break the shield. He did not pay attention to the words of the middle-aged mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another shield, Papan finally recovered from the vertigo, recalling the situation, he was afraid, angry, and uploaded The pain that was almost unbearable, he shivered and touched it, and the messy touch almost made Papang really faint, and his proud face was ruined! This discovery almost made Papan lose his sense of reason. Even the feeling of pain was suppressed. He pointed at Richard and screamed wildly: "Bastard! Dare to dare to fight me with me?! Loser I want to give each other an ass!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard Papan’s scream, Richard calmed down and took back the attack on the shield, and even sorted out the rewind To the sleeves of the arms, the expression solemnly said with a calmness that does not match the age: "I accept!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" The mage brows and stops. But another wizard pulled his magic robe and said, "Let them go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mage slammed the voice slightly, saying "But Richard is a student of His Royal Highness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter smiled and whispered: "The challenged guy is Papan, he is Rando. A small follower of the husband. Randolph is also a student of His Highness. So I think that the magic duel is Papan's original intention, but this idiot almost messed things up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged mage wakes up and says: "This is something between the students under the Highness, we don't have to mix it in. Ok, do it according to the rules!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The tradition in the deep blue, if there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the two sides, then the solution is equally effective in using magical people in addition to using gold coins. When one party proposes a magic duel and the other party agrees to accept it, and there is no significant gap between the strengths of the two sides, a duel is established and is carried out under the supervision of the Dark Blue Law Enforcement Master. There is a special place for the magic duel, and a special mage is appointed to protect the venue. The use of the duel field requires a large margin deposit in advance for compensation for possible damage to the duel facility. The main duty of the resident mage is to protect both sides of the duel, because the principle of magical duel is not life-threatening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, absolute fairness does not exist. For example, Papan's registration information is a level 1 magician, but the magic has actually reached the level of the second-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Richard and Papan stood at the ends of the duel, separated by twenty meters. Papan's injury was treated with a simple treatment. In addition to his pale face, he could not see the original wolf, and the magic robe stained with blood was replaced with a new one, but how to look at the half of the nose is unnatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is only a magical duel between the first-level magicians, the spread of the conflict just now is surprisingly fast, due to the particularity of Richard’s identity, Many people came to the crowd and were able to accommodate two hundred people sitting in the stands. The onlookers' attitudes are very relaxed. The acquaintances greet each other. It seems that they have not regarded the next duel as a major event. The battle between the first-level magic apprentices has nothing to look at, that is, neither side has any defense, use a level of magic. Boom can't die. Moreover, with their magic, they can release up to three levels of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
