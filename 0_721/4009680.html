Those cumbersome and complicated formulas he understands almost at a glance. But the more he learned, Richard felt that the more the mystery of the magical world, the more he let him know his ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very focused and can stand the loneliness. Now in his life, there is nothing more than magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already winter in a blink of an eye. When the first snow was raging, Richard did not know. The weather outside is very cold, and the climate in the deep blue is warm as spring. After living in the dark blue for a few months, he even adapted to an environment filled with soft magical lights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This late night, a shining meteor is far and near, breaking through the sky and the fog falls on the dark blue top platform. There have been three magisters who have led up to twenty magicians to wait respectfully, regardless of the cold wind and the heavy snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming of the fire broke out and the small figure of Su Hailun fell out. Immediately, two young female magicians put on her fur cloak. Four other magicians laid a scarlet carpet in front of her feet. The carpet continued to expand in front, and after Su Hailun passed, another magician rolled up the carpet behind. From the landing stage to the living area, Su Hailun’s feet did not really touch the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magisters followed closely around Su Helun and whispered and quickly reported her dark blue affairs during this time. Su Hailun listened lazily and seemed to have little interest. However, when the third magister reported the lectures and talents, her eyes suddenly turned bright and asked: "Do you mean that the little Richard has talent in the magic array?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being staring at her bright eyes, the beard, who is close to the white, has a tight body and immediately emerges a cold sweat. High-level wizards know that the taste of the legendary mage can be uncomfortable, and it feels similar to the frog that the snake looks at. The difference in mental power will cause the low-level mages to withstand tremendous pressure, and there is very little impact from Longwei. He did not expect Su Hailun to pay attention to such a small thing. Fortunately, he was fully prepared. He immediately took out two sketches of the magical array drawn by Richard and handed it to Su Helun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s eyes fell on the sketches, and they were immediately attracted, and even the footsteps slowed down unconsciously. Finally, they simply stopped and looked over and over again. Two sketches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold sweat on the side of the magician was unable to control it. In his opinion, these two sketches are very common, but they are the most basic two entry magic arrays. They are all standard formats, and there is no innovation at all. In fact, the magic array of this type of entry is simple in structure, clear in principle, limited in function, and there is no need for innovation and improvement. What Richard painted is the standard version of the professor in the classroom. He took this matter separately and reported it to Su Hailun, just because Su Hailun once showed great interest in Richard, even during the whole process of testing. Stay in the monitoring room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a few hours! A few hours of the main plane! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precious level of the legendary Master’s time does not have to be said, so he also figured out the importance that Su Hailun attached to Richard, and has been paying attention to Richard since then. Now that Richard has made a little progress, he will report this as an important matter. In essence, this magician is only looking for Su Hailun's likes, because the monthly income and expenditure items he receives, 'Su Hailun's joy' is the most important one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is really just a little progress. The magic circle drawn by Richard is not a bit wrong, but it is nothing at all. Any well-trained mage who draws a standard magical array is less likely to make mistakes. However, Richard’s first practice of drawing a magical array is completely error-free, which is a bit rare. But who can become a big magician, and which one is not a stunning person? In the eyes of this great magister, this achievement will not be put in the eye. Of course, the absolute error of the two magic arrays and the standard version is surprisingly small and small enough to be incredible. But drawing the magic array is not a processing of alchemy parts, the accuracy can be as long as the standard is reached, but the high is not meaningful. If the 1 mm error does not affect the magic array, why do you want to do it below 10 microns? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard can innovate on the two entry magic arrays, he will look at it differently. You can want to innovate the magic array yourself, which is not something that a magician below level 10 can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Su Hailun looked so long, that is, this big magician is really an idiot, and know that these two sketches are not so simple. But he really can't see what is special about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's too good!" Su Hailun screamed and reached for the shoulder of the magician. But she grew small, and the magician was very tall and it was a little hard to shoot. The Magister immediately bent down in a quiet voice, allowing her to easily photograph herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Su Hailun’s white little hand was heavily photographed on the shoulder of the Magister, and the Magister immediately felt like he was being shot by a dragon. Unstoppable to be photographed on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun’s exclamation, waved a magic water shield to cover the magician, floated him from the ground, and said: “Just too happy ", the starting point is a bit heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not heavy, just right!" The magician's old face smiled like the flowers that had been beaten by the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waving two magic sketches in his hand, Su Helun was happy again and said, "I didn't expect you to see the extraordinary sketches of these two sketches." Ah hahaha! You haven't seen this time, you have become smarter! What have you eaten recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All your guidance is good." He smiled humbly, as if he was arguing with credit, he couldn’t see that he didn’t know what the two sketches were all about. Being able to sit in today's position, he is not a simple character. However, the heart of the Magister is inevitably slightly accelerated, because Su Hailun’s unbridled laughter is a sign, which means that on the bill at the end of this month, there will be a striking number under the ‘Su Hailun’s Joy’. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Su Hailun is like a little girl eager to share with others, not suppressing her anxiety at all. She shows the sketch to the three great mages. "You see, these two sketches are almost exactly the same as the standard version!" She particularly emphasized the same word. When the three magisters looked at the two sketches, the face finally showed a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The error between the two sketches and the standard version is within 0.01 cm, and the error is very stable. This accuracy and stability is only ten or more, and After a long time, the most rigorous training of the great magician can be achieved, and Richard, he is only a first-class mage apprentice." Su Hailun continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician immediately said: "This is a rare talent! And he also has excellent mental strength..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another magician rushed to say: "His talents in all aspects are very good, there is no clear short board..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The third place, that is, the magician who handed the sketches to Su Helun, took a cold breath and said in an incredible tone: "We got a future magician?!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case!" Su Hailun smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ultimate force of mankind, the construction of the knight is a general term, which can be subdivided into multiple occupations such as archers, shields, and armor, and even Including the Magic Attack Master. But their necessary feature is that they can carry at least three magic patterns. A medium-sized magical structure can increase the combat power of melee classes by 30%. Therefore, the combat power of the 13th and 4th-level knights can be compared with the fighters of the 17th level or so, and the role played on the battlefield is still over. The occupation system is a pyramid, and the higher the number, the more rare it is. The number of 18-level combat professionals is very limited, and they are all strong players who are vying for each other. No one will join the army as cannon fodder. However, the individual combat power of the knights is no less inferior to those of the sanctuary, but they can be rushed in battle on the battlefield. Naturally, they can reverse the power of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the formation of the knight on the battlefield, every famous military general will have the same motto: only the knight can be built to deal with the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of this miracle is the magic pattern builder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of strong people in the Sanctuary is limited, but the high-ranking fighters around the 13th and 4th levels do not count as much, and there are few. However, the total number of knights in the Holy Alliance is always one thousand, and the peak of the glory is no more than three thousand. The bottleneck is stuck in the number of magic pattern builders. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the knight is a strategic force, the legendary mage is a strategic deterrent, then the magician is the builder of strategic advantage. It is only the requirements of becoming a magical structure builder that is extremely demanding, requires extraordinary magical talent, superior control and creativity, and has sufficient patience. The area of ​​the many knights that can carry the magical parts is very limited. The magical structure builders often need to concentrate the large magic array in the palm-sized area, and then onto the special inserts or directly to the knights. Body. The work of the senior magical structure builder has been complicated and complicated to the point that ordinary people can't see clearly with the naked eye. Large, powerful structures often take months to manufacture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Alliance empire, one of the three major empires of the Terran, so far, even the initial level is counted, the number of builders is only ten . Each is the object of the royal family or the local aristocrats. Even an initial level builder means a team of knights after ten years. For any superior, this is a temptation to refuse. The status of the senior builder is not much lower than that of the legendary mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two sketches, Richard just showed the most important talent of a builder, and that is the finest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two sketches, Su Hailun is more and more like it, and his smile is getting more and more unscrupulous. The loud laughter is getting farther and farther. Not only is the top of the entire magic tower covered, but there are signs of gradual penetration below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This woman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three magisters may have found this in their hearts But on the surface, she smiled with the uniformity of Su Hailun, and smiled naturally, as if the future builder, Richard, was their own son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really can’t help but laugh!" Su Hailun suddenly sighed and then continued to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
