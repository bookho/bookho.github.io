			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is like a spring, sprayed from Charles’s headless body, splashing around The person looks at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amber knife light fades, long knife extinction does not know when to get the scabbard, Richard is striding past a few savage people, The Archimonde family castle is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people passed by for a moment before they recovered from the horror. Until then, they suddenly saw two extra arms on the ground in addition to Charles's body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of them found out that their arms had not been degraded by Richard, and suddenly screamed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them, and Charles, are the people who hold the weapon after recognizing Richard’s identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two shrine knights glanced at each other and followed Richard to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil and screams of the transmission array alerted the entire floating island, and a large number of soldiers showed their weapons and rushed to the transmission. And a few quick and unfortunate figures crossed the ordinary warriors and knights, and they appeared in front of Richard in a blink of an eye. In an instant, hundreds of soldiers stood in front of Richard, and the blade became a forest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the sky, you can see the open space in front of the floating island. Richard and the two Knights of the Temple are like three little black spots. And opposite them, it is black pressing an enemy, encircling a semi-arc, and encircling them in the middle. The contrast between the strengths of the two, but the formation of confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt, fear, anger, viciousness, hesitation, Richard read a lot from the opposite face or slightly familiar, or completely strange face. The whispering is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's Richard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The young Master Richard is back, what should I do?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hundreds of eyes watching, Richard is not afraid Even the extinction did not come out. His cold eyes swept through the enemies in front of him, and the calm but cold voice spread throughout the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, all want to destroy the family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short sentence, like an ice cube Throw it into the oil pan and let the crowd burst into flames! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turmoil of the past few days, the successful robbery of the past, and the temptation and connivance of some big men and giants, so that they completely forgot their original status . Although it is slightly irritating, it is still a calm day, so many people are more and more aware that they should be the floating island, the master of these wealth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Richard’s sentence finally reminds them of the consequences of doing so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arkmond never gets soft on the family of the rebellion. In fact, any of the giants in Noland has a record of bloody suppression of the rebellious branch. Destroying the family is only an inevitable outcome, but the process can become long and rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly screamed: "This guy is pretending to be a young master, killing him!" If the scream is not so screaming, it will finally make a broken sound. Maybe it will be a bit convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for the crowd to scream, a tall and beautiful woman in front of Richard screamed: "Shut up!" Her voice was clear and clear, like a dragon and a phoenix, almost everyone’s brain was a bang, a moment blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed and took two steps to Richard, kneeling on one knee and said: "The Count of Ellie, His Majesty, Faschi, met Richard. Young Master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashchi’s performance surprised Richard, this is a very heavy etiquette, even to express goodwill, but she is Earl of Ellie The person, it is reasonable to say that there is no need for the courtesy of Richard. At the same time, the face of the Baron on the other side was overcast, and the gray gloom was like the sky of the winter ice floes. The people of Earl of Goliath are as indifferent as ever, perhaps he is really only observing and recording, and not ready to participate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd began to have a slight commotion, and countless eyes swept back and forth on the representatives of the three giants, and the three manifestations of distinctness clearly made many people start to groan. disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows wrinkled and stepped forward to support Faschi, saying, "You shouldn't salute?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl said that when you return to the floating island, I am your subordinate and need to follow your instructions until the Earl of the Lord orders."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice!" Richard was indulged, unable to figure out the intention of the new generation of female war gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi is an unexpected boost and very powerful. The results of the detection feedback show that there are actually six structures on the 19th level. Although half of them are in the initial stage, the combat power is extremely strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard dared to face hundreds of people in the side-by-side family, not only to fear death, but to have another card. One of the cards is the two knights behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Baron Suya said leisurely: "Master Li, you will kill a few people as soon as you return, and then prepare to put hundreds of them here. Archimonde copy / family annihilation, this prestige can be enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s gaze finally fell on the Baron of Suya, coldly Say: "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya's face changed, and several guards behind him have already angered Richard's rudeness, several people's hands They all pressed to the hilt of the waist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of Richard immediately fell on the hands of those holding swords, all in the eyes are Mori! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Suya suddenly stunned and immediately raised his hand to stop the further movements of his men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his eyes slightly and said faintly: "It’s very timely. Whoever dared to pull out the sword, I will chop him up to feed the feet. "Flying dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron of Suya was cold and said coldly: "Richard, you are too crazy! Here is..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the floating island of the Marquis of Gordon!" Richard interrupted Suya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suya’s face changed again, and he snorted and corrected: “This is the floating island of Archimonde!” He highlighted Archimonde. This last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
