			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zuka statue is destroyed, but because it is a thriving troll kingdom The Lord's Holy Spirit, therefore, although I have not known how many years have passed, there are still many divine remnants. However, under the test of quicksand, the fragments of the gods are entwined with a layer of grayish black, which is obviously mixed with a powerful curse in the divinity. In this way, these fragments of the gods no longer have the standard of sacrifice, but they do not know whether the nest will be interested in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When exploring the entire upper-level city, Richard spread the troops, and a follower led a small team of fighters and five throwing soldiers to act together in the air elite bat Guided by the hidden trolls around the clear. A moment later, more than a dozen troll hunters were killed. From the upper level of the city, a screaming whistle was heard, and dozens of trolls jumped out of the hiding place and fled to the upper city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of consciousness, immediately transferred three elite bats and flew in the direction of the whistle. But one of the bats suddenly saw a troll in the field of vision. It hid behind a broken wall, holding a spear in his hand, and his blood-red eyes stared at the bat! In his heart, Li was shocked and immediately commanded three bats to dodge. However, in the bat's field of vision, the throwing spear was expanding sharply. In the blink of an eye, the whole world was darkened and the contact with Richard was disconnected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the body and looked far away. He saw six or seven spears flying, lightning-piercing bats in the air, carrying them It flew up a few tens of meters before falling far. Troll hunters' spears are so powerful that they can penetrate adult violent bears, purely in terms of power, but also far above the throwing soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked and immediately let the rest of the elite bats take off and hover over a hundred meters. At this distance, it is the troll's spear that is not easy to hit. He looked at the top of the mountain and sank. The area where the trolls are now living on the upper level, and the area where the troll chieftain and the great sacrifice are located. At the top is the temple and the altar. The whistle came in the direction of the Great Chiefs, and the trolls that were withdrawn from all over the place also gathered there. The trolls seem to be deliberately avoiding the Sacrifice and the Temple District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had thought that the trolls that were active in the ruins were like the ones killed, leaving only the instinct of the creatures and losing their wisdom. But the trolls who whistled and retreated were obviously wise, and the troll hunters who ambushed the elite bats also showed keen observation and powerful lethality. Few people are able to watch elite bats being manipulated. From time to time, the ruins of Jubval circling the grotesque birds, but the troll hunters only started with the elite bats, apparently seeing something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the wisdom of the trolls, Richard can't treat these trolls as sporadic in the wild beasts. He began to give instructions, and the soldiers behind him were divided into three roads, each of which was interspersed along the edge of the Emirates. The middle hundred were led by Richard himself and went straight to the Emirates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emirates area is large in size, but there are not many buildings, but each building is very tall. After rushing into the Emirates, Richard saw a few hundred meters away, dozens of trolls are fleeing into the jungle. In the jungle, there is a vague road that passes through the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master! What now?" asked Oral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, how could these trolls run away? With a wave of his hand, he shouted: "Catch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before rushing into the forest, Richard gave himself a protective magic before entering the jungle. In the forest, the troll hunter is like a fish, but the forest environment does not hinder the soldiers of Richard. In the jungle, Shuihua, Gangde and Tiramisu are all good followers. The troops followed the traces left by the trolls for a few kilometers before they found the troll camp in a small valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li just got out of the forest and hit a spear on the head! Richard flashed sideways and had already passed the route of throwing a spear. At the same time, the magical flash of the body flashed, the effect of defending against long-range attacks appeared, and the route of throwing spears was deflected a bit. As a low-level magic, the effect of defending against long-range attacks is effective. It has obvious effects on ordinary bows and arrows. If you attack the trolls, you can only make the throwing spears slightly deviate from the original route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear throws past Richard and slams into a big tree, almost smashing the trunk of a person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few tens of meters away, a troll's figure flashed and disappeared into the ruins. In the twinkling of an eye, it drilled out from the other direction and threw two spears into the forest. The fierce screams in the forest came one after another, and a troll flew like a fly, rushing from all directions to the army of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This troll tribe's camp was built in a small ruin, I don't know what it was for. In addition to the trolls in the forest, a troll is constantly pouring out in the camp. Half of the trolls in the camp are dyed with red top mane, no warrior, and the other half are dyed with dark red mane, which is obviously taller and stronger than the same kind. The decoration on the body is more complicated and brighter, and it is also more intelligent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being besieged on unfavorable terrain, Richard did not panic. He roughly estimated the position, waved a fireball and fired it in the air three meters from the ground. The fire wave covered the corner of the camp, and there were several painful screams. Several trolls escaped from hiding places, and their bodies were burning with magical flames, burning them and screaming. However, Richard knows that for these trolls with ten powers, a fireball without any super magic effect is not fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hechao summoned in consciousness, a sharp whistling sound in the forest, a row of throwing axe throwing from the forest, the giant that will be exposed The devil is all killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest, the humanoid warrior has been entangled with the trolls, Gangde and Tiramisu become two meat grinders, ordinary troll warriors It is not their opponent who is fully attacked. Oral began to sing the war songs, making a personal warrior more fierce. As the level of the Elf poet increases, the effectiveness of the Elf Wars is also increased. The current elf poet can give the soldiers within tens of meters to be motivated, and the strength of the attack is close to 10%. The effect of pure promotion is that war songs are far less powerful than magic and magic. But the scope of war songs is so large that it affects a large number, but far exceeds the corresponding magic and magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humanoid warriors are extremely well equipped, far from being able to mix wood, bones and irons. They also have triple blessings of battle songs, magic and magic, even in the forest, the individual combat power is not inferior to the troll. Therefore, in the entanglement, the humanoid warrior is not much damaged, but the troll with the environmental advantage continues to appear dead and wounded. And soon after the war began, black warriors one after another joined the battle. These elite undead creatures don't know the pain, they don't fear death, and the trolls are also shuddering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the forest, Richard flashed again from behind the tree, took a thin booklet from his arms, reminded him with magic, and immediately Six violent bears appeared, and the magic creatures roared and rushed to the troll camp dozens of meters away. However, a few spears flew out of the camp and almost nailed the four violent bears directly! The two violent bears rushing to the edge of the camp have not yet made a comeback. Two trolls up to three meters rushed out, and the spears pierced into the mouth of the violent bear with lightning. When the two violent bears struggled for a few times, they turned into magical energy and dissipated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this result, Richard couldn’t help but frown. Trolls are born hunters, and their ability to kill all kinds of beasts is unparalleled. The two giant trolls with extra body size have close to thirteenth level of combat power, and they are the key to instant attack, so they kill the summoning creature of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
