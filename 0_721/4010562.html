			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown for what reason, this extremely ordinary armor has been carefully kept to Now, looking at the way it is treated, it is treated the same as the sky of the sky, and it still has to be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the cockroach was neatly tidy, she even put her hair up, and the bunch of pulsating pony tails fluttered like the same year, she left behind The two letters were placed outside, closing the inner door and gently stroking the clear sky. After a while, I finally looked up and said to the tree of life: "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, respect the great elders." Life Tree said, and then there was a strip of time and space on the walls of the room. When the light was wrapped around the wall, the room would be separated. The constraint of the plane law appears outside the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding the clear sky, quietly waiting for the last moment, she decided to face Iskra, although it can still be delayed for a long time. However, the coalition of the guardian elves is approaching. If she stays, the life tree and the Yongye tribe can't move. In the scope of the tree of life, they can fight as usual, but the warriors of the tribe must suffer heavy casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not that Richard appears, he will choose to fight to the end, because she will die, the Yongye tribe will not escape the pursuit of the Elf Alliance, but now Richard Come, you will have the object of entrustment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that I will not disappoint myself, I am thinking, my thoughts are going back to the days when I first traveled, now I think about it, that time left It’s just cold and bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the mood was chaotic, the light and shadow flashed in front of him, and Richard actually appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are." I was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will accompany you for a ride." Richard is talking about a trivial little thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyebrows are all upright and shouted: "You are noisy, is this a battle that you can intervene? I just don't want you to come in, just... immediately Go back, if you die, how do I face Ilani and...and that guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and said: "It's already late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed, looking out the window, not seeing the starry sky, but the dark void, occasionally It can be seen that the splendid light belt blooms. It is already an endless void outside the crystal wall. When it comes here, it means that it is out of the protection of the plane rule, and it has to face the face-to-face confrontation with Iskara. Now, even if Richard wants to go back, It is not an easy task, at least to resist Isakara's several rounds of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You." For a moment, I didn’t know what to say. She took a deep breath and calmed down and said, "Since you want to die, then Just come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temper is slowly relaxing, a strip of blue light overflows from the inside, and eventually forms a pair behind her. Dozens of meters of light wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled a little, but he was not eager to show his strength. Instead, he took out a crystal bottle and drank the liquid inside, and then took the crystal. The bottle was thrown on the ground and said, "I am ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;茜 I felt the sudden surge of fire in Richard’s body, and I saw Li in a strange way. A glance, then swinging the sky, the room was instantly split, and Richard appeared in the void, immediately instinctively released magic protection, wrapped himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The void is not a void, but a beautiful band of glamorous aurora, and Richard is the first to see such a scene, shocked, The heart is deeply moved. These bands of light are synonymous with death at the same time. They appear to mean wild energy storms. If they are swept by them, Richard estimates that he can’t support much. Time, this is why the exploration of the plane is the exclusive domain of the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a loud voice sounded instantly: "Welcome to my world, the world of Iscara."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of Li’s eye is changing rapidly. In a blink of an eye, he finds himself in an ancient battlefield. It’s deserted, cold, and dark in the sky. The stars, the earth is rugged and rugged, and there are cracks and stone rocks everywhere. This is a silent and silent world, but suddenly there is a wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first wind, the world has changed, a team of fighters appear on both ends of the earth, one is a human and elf warrior, and the other One side is countless strange creatures, and the black pressure is not seen. When Richard observes the movement, he understands the rules of the world. The strength of both sides is turned into a warrior, and the outcome of the decisive battle is carried out in the form of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a glance, Richard’s warriors belonging to the Iskra side are ten times more than their own. I am afraid that there will be more than a hundred times, but this is not cheating, but a real contrast between the strengths of the two sides, and it is not Iscara that is on the battlefield. The whole consciousness, because it still maintains the existence of other planes, but compared with the huge power gap, the battlefield itself is even more shocking to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is present, it is the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world is illusory, but it is also true, at least at this moment, it is true and true, Richard can kill the warrior opposite, attacked himself It will also be wounded, and the whole world is a manifestation of Isakara's will, and it is established according to its will and by predetermined rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fair war, even because Iscara wants to build this world, which consumes a part of its own strength, but only by comparing the military forces of both sides, Iscara consumes more power, and it is all about winning the game. It is also to see the world. Richard really understands the power to destroy the world's demon. Why is it strong and strong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War, is the eternal theme, let us use war for the final solution, entertain me, little guys." When Iskara When it rings, it becomes the only voice in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Li heard was the human lingua franca, and what he heard was the high elf language. In fact, what Iskara said must be their own language. However, under the influence of the power of the law, it naturally transforms into a language that both Richard and Hee can understand. This also shows that, in the control of the law, Iskara is completely above them, destroying the demon of the plane, every One is born to control the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The First Legion, ready to attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless monster is moving in the distance, Although it was only a small part of the whole monster sea, from the strength of the troops, it was still several times the army of Richard and the scorpion. On the other side, the elf coalition suddenly began to change, and some elf shooters and Druids disappeared. Instead, the cavalry riding the bucks and the elf guards armed with long rifles, obviously, have more experience in commanding such units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also able to adjust the arms, Richard’s heart was moving, and immediately looked down to his own square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a standard Terran mixed force, about 5,000 or so, arms, shields, light infantry, long gunners, archers to light rides, The priest of the Master is all available. The light infantry is about the rank of the elite of the Terran, and the highest rank is the 12th-level Terran reloading knight. Richard’s gaze falls on a light infantry. The idea, the body of the soldier suddenly became more sturdy, and the head grew taller, and the leather armor became a delicate chain armor. The round wooden shield and short sword in the hand became the green oil. The kite-shaped shield and the steel long sword, in the blink of an eye, this light infantry has become a ten-level elite shield sword infantry, at the cost of the two infantry around you disappeared forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
