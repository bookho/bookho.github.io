			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and took out a piece of high-purity magic crystal A small pocket, stuffed into the hands of the old man, said: "This is the transmission fee, round trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man took the pocket and left it to the side without hesitation Followers, then seriously said to Richard: "This journey may be harder than you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know!"< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed, like a younger generation, with a relative in his hands, and a heavy shot on the back of Richard, saying: "Go then. I really hope to have the opportunity to earn 250,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no chance, old man!" Richard returned to the middle finger and strode Into the transmission array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical light flashed, and Richard has appeared on a small island tens of thousands of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small island with a large scale. The island is home to thousands of people, one of which is a barbarian. After Richard walked out of the transmission array, someone immediately walked up and took Richard to the dock. A small sailboat is ready, and the ship carries food and water for Richard, as well as something that might be used when traveling on the Caledonian continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard boarded the ship, the small sailboat set sail. Richard and the captain simply talked a few words, clearly understand their next trip, immediately hurry to drink water, then close their eyes and adjust their state to the best, while enumerating the details in the bottom of their hearts. All your own cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two talents of wisdom and truth, destroying the real name, the power of Akmon and the silver moon elves, the magical armor, and even the fate of the twins, the elf long knife The extinction of the long knife, and finally the book of bearing. With these cards in the body, although Richard has only fourteen levels of magic, he is not afraid. Of course, it is impossible to beat the mountains and the sea, but he feels that there is already a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the small sailboat finally arrived in the mainland of Calando, and the wind blowing from the mainland became vigorous and desolate, whizzing past, rolling up The waves make the boat ups and downs. The closer to the mainland, the more violent the wave was, and it was hard to drive into the breakwater and climb the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a barbarian village with tall totem poles draped with bright fabric strips and hunting in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pier here is not as fine as Noland, but the log is broken into two or three pieces directly, and then nailed to the frame made of logs, which becomes A rugged floating approach bridge. The people on the sailboat threw the two cables on the dock, and the two barbarian men who were obviously much stronger than the Norand humans took the cable and pulled it hard. The sailboat was firmly close to the embankment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha jumped on the shore, his heart beats unstoppable, his eyes loomed from afar, the sky farther than Noord, the wings of the sky The huge eagle that passed, and even the barbarian village with a strong and cool style in front of it, swept through one by one, and the heart seemed to be wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain said to Richard: "Okay, Mr. Richard, I can only send you here. The next journey, you need to be careful." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and stuffed the captain with a small bag of gold coins and walked to the barbarian village on the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your generosity! Mr. Richard!" The captain was overjoyed and shouted at Richard's background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee passed through the barbarian village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treading the Horde is clearly influenced by Noland, and has learned to build multi-storey houses with brick and stone. The village’s parliament hall is a three-story building. Building. In addition to the sacred land of the Tengfeng tribe and the treadmill tribe, it is still dominated by wooden tents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the architectural styles are different, but the various decorations that are visible are still retaining the rich traditional tribal style, and the exterior walls of the house are painted white. Decorated with thick, light red stripes, the roof of the house is erected with a huge totem of the eagle-wing type, with a cluster of brightly colored strips on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many barbarian women are tidying up the fish and seafood, and the freshly washed and sliced ​​fish are sliced ​​in layers. A group of children chased after running barefoot, screaming and running past Richard. The pavement is paved with stones, rugged, and occasionally sharp sharp corners and sharp thorns. However, the barefoot children's bare feet stepped on, but they were not injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, a few barbarian singers squatted on a complete log thicker than the waist, striding to the dock, preparing to play more piles in the sea. Good reinforcement of the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the village, there was a burst of majestic battle songs. It turned out that the hunting team that had gone far had just returned. More than a dozen barbarian men were naked in the upper body, carrying a hill-like monster, appearing on the avenue outside the village, walking towards this side. Every hunter has shiny skin, beating muscles, and there is no shortage of men's medals: scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of the hunting team is obviously very rich, and the village suddenly cheers, and both men, women and children flock to the village to welcome the returning warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a picture of living and working in peace and contentment, but it makes people feel the determination and courage of the barbarians against the harsh environment. Everyone who grows and grows on such a land is a natural warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large-scale market in the village, and the number of stores is also exceptional. From time to time in the village, you can see the Nolanders wearing barbarian suits coming in and out. This village is one of the bases of the Tengfeng tribe and the Nelson family. If you carefully distinguish the types of buildings around you, you will find that the number of warehouses is almost the same as that of the houses. A large amount of materials are collected from this small village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha letter stepped out of the barbarian village, identified the direction, and went to the northeast. According to the map of Nelson, that is the direction leading to the central area of ​​the Calando continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the village behind the barbarian has long since disappeared on the horizon. At this moment, Richard looked around and looked at the vast wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it’s the dry season of the Calando continent. The ground is covered with sparse hay, and it’s far from being seen that several tall giant trees are scattered in the wilderness. on. Tianzhengqing is fine, the field of vision is extraordinarily broad, you can see the sky, there is a lonely eagle hovering alone, and a group of takins on the distant land are not in a hurry to line up, a few hundred meters behind the cattle, a group of wilderness coyotes Follow with and without waiting, waiting for an opportunity to know when it will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a giant tree a few hundred meters away, several Gobi bloodthirsty dragons are lazily crouching under the shade of the trees, at your fingertips. Food turns a blind eye. After the adulthood, the bloodthirsty dragon with a height of three meters is the hegemon of this wilderness, but once he is full, he will be too lazy to move for a few days. The adult ritual of the barbarian youth being promoted to the real warrior is to hunt a bloodthirsty dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
