			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the safari, Richard received an accident through the Jinhui Battle Flag Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallen pastor Ma Wen, who has been active in the Sequoia Kingdom, has news. After a month or two, the Duke of the Wolverine suddenly changed his attitude. Not only did he summon Marvin, but he promised to give him and others shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Richard does not have any title or title, Marvin has fabricated an identity of an ancient aristocratic son for Richard and found an aristocratic family that has long since become extinct. , inherited their title. This kind of thing is very common in the Sequoia Kingdom, and only a few gold coins are needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtual title is meaningless, even if it is self-styled Duke's descendants are useless. But the Duke of the Wolf gave Richard a title to develop the knight and picked several villages in the border area for Richard to choose. This is the real land and the foundation of any nobleman. The title of the pioneering knight can not be hereditary. Its significance lies in the legal expansion of the outside world. The area that the knights have attacked is their own legal seal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the history of human expansion of aliens, the cornerstone of the lowest level of the nobles of the Cavaliers has always been at the forefront of the war. When the Terran gradually occupied the main position of the Qihui mainland, the development of the Cavaliers became an important force for the war between the hostile countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneering knight also has a designated area for development. In theory, it is ok to specify a large empire as a development scope, as long as you can play it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the initial seal given by the Duke of the Wolf, he actually gave two directions for development. The East is the old rival of the Duke of the Wolf, the White Rock Principality, and the West is a few inhabited areas on the edge of the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine will be the direct backing of Richard. The Baron’s territory is rich in fertility and can provide sufficient supplies as long as Richard can afford the gold coins. At the same time, Baron Fontaine will also be the target of Richard. In the process of development, inevitably a large number of slaves will be produced, and the baron is very interested in this business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the Wolf gave Richard a very generous condition, and naturally there is no reason. At the end of Marvin's letter, it is stated that the Duke of the Wolf also wants to get a 'construction' as a reward for Richard's lord. Seeing this, Richard's mind quickly deduced the news transmission route in the Bishui Oasis, and vaguely caught a little bit of the complicated relationship between the surrounding human countries. In the last sentence, Ma Wen mentioned his level. Because of this, he actually gained more power, and the priest level has been raised to seven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about it, Richard looked at the drifting of Marvin, and the latter did not seem to be surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the Cavaliers is necessary to specify the scope of the pioneer, so Richard returned a short letter, which chose a small village in the west as his own territory, and Delineated a horrible scope of development: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood and the ancestral plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After replying to the letter, Richard left the supply point of Jinhui Battle Flag and led the team again to continue exploring the depths of the blood-stained land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of blood is full of danger, and white bones can be seen everywhere. Richard has become accustomed to the scene of death and killing, and also sees the miserable scene left by the caravan after being robbed by the horse. So when the distant side saw a distant battlefield relic, Richard did not have any surprise expressions, but rather stopped the horses and waved a captain to bring a small group of Shamin fighters to see what happened. After a while, the sealed knight ran back and his face was dignified. Please look at him in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle took place at least ten days ago. Most of the bodies that fell on the ground had rotted. There was a scavenger living on the battlefield. A large group of vultures were surrounded by a body. Until Richard's war horses were less than ten meters away from them, these guys reluctantly patted their wings and flew up, but still kept squatting above the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee’s line of sight slowly sweeps across the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fierce and large-scale battle. The fighting party is a regular escort. Seeing the armor and the flag belong to the blood lions business group, it is also ranked. One of the top business groups. The escort's combat power is even more than the stables. They have more than 300 bodies left behind. Even in the blood-stained area, this size of the escort is enough to make the most horrible thieves think carefully. On the side of the battlefield, there were more than a dozen truck wrecks. All the trucks were opened by heavy weapons, and all kinds of residual goods were thrown off the ground. The goods are mainly various ores, and the value is precious to rare. If the cargo of more than a dozen vehicles is such ore, it will be worth at least tens of thousands of gold coins after being delivered to the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the truck, there are hundreds of bodies falling vertically, these should be the members of the caravan. The corpses have different postures, resistance, escape, and others are begging for mercy. Regardless of the effort, the final outcome turned into a corpse. When Richard saw the number of bodies, he knew that the entire caravan should be here, and no one was spared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residual goods, bodies that have been inspected, especially Richard noticed that there were almost no bags left with water and food. The conclusion quickly emerged, and the attackers only took away the supplies, as well as the high-value and good-looking property, and showed no interest in the bulky ore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caravan of this size, even if it is the flag of the Scarlet Cossack, Richard will carefully consider it. But now the entire caravan has become a corpse, then, what about the enemy? Is there no casualties? Is there any force in the blood-stained land that has the same habits as him, will he collect the will of his own dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s gaze fell on the body of a black knight on the battlefield. This is a very tall knight, more powerful than the barbarian. The heavy armor on his body is at least a few hundred kilograms. From the armor, the power of the knight is no less inferior to the ogre. Such a heavy body is not something that ordinary horses can carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a short distance from the Cavaliers, there is also a horrible horse that is at least one meter taller than the usual horse. This horse not only found two long fangs from his mouth, but also grew several spurs of varying lengths around his body. The war horse is not only on the giant hoof, but also on the bone spurs with dry and clear blood. Its mouth even bites a broken arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only this kind of horse has enough power to bear the black armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavalier’s body was inserted with at least a dozen weapons, and his body was centered, with dozens of members of the escort. Obviously they killed a horrible enemy with the accumulation of life. The war horse was also inserted with several long weapons, and the body of a dozen guards was pressed against him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been dead for a long time, but there seems to be a lingering terror in the bodies of the black knights and horses. A variety of scavenging organisms, whether they are vultures, hyenas, or even insects, are reluctant to approach the black armor's body within a few meters. Don't say the bodies of the knights and horses, even the bodies of the guards in this area are intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee frowned, and the black knight made him feel very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
