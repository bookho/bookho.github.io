But until the end of meditation, I have never seen the purple star. In fact, the dark blue fantasy is very clear, this kind of purple starburst is very rare, and each time lasts for a short time, most people see it, but can't capture it. And Richard can calculate its trajectory, which means that one can catch one. This speed of improving magic can be said to be unbeatable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In time, it is not impossible to catch up with Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has just been full of enthusiasm, suddenly remembered, the legendary wizard who often wanders between the planes magic mathematics will only be stronger than him, will not be weaker than him, if Let her see the third-order purple starburst, what can't be grasped? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed, slightly pleasant. If you go on like this, you don't know which day you can catch up with the legendary mage. But after thinking about it, Richard laughed again. There are thousands of Masters of Noland, and several others can stand shoulder to shoulder with He Helen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another day. The Western Expeditionary Army spent a full eight days in the Cracked Rock Canyon. Richard finally summoned all the nobles and had to open a military conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the meeting, I don’t know who discussed the issue of the proportion of troops, so the nobility was noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally raised his hands and let everyone calm down before he said: "People, it seems that the increase in the proportion of soldiers is a very sensitive issue. It doesn't matter! You have enough time to discuss. Because we lost too much in the Cracked Rock Canyon, I decided to go back to the Blue Water Oasis and join the new troops before re-executing the Long Line Plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are somewhat surprised, but no one has ever opposed Richard’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard’s gaze passed through the bloody valley and several other places, and his lips faint smile. If Saranwell wants to do it, then these are the places most likely to be ambushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at the same time as the delivery of supplies, Jinhui Battle Flag also collects intelligence from neighboring human countries in accordance with the requirements of Richard. The official of the Iron Triangle Empire did not seem to turn its attention to the small movements here, but the emperor began to gather his own private army on the eastern line of the Empire and transferred troops to the south. The goal is coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been in the Cracked Rock Canyon for eight days, but has not found the whereabouts of Salenville, which is very unusual. The later the appearance of Salenville, the more intense the attack will be. Richard doesn't think that this opponent who used to almost push himself to the road with a wolf warrior will let such a clear opportunity. Most of the time he was hiding in a certain place, laying a trap, waiting for himself to hit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obviously not feasible to rely solely on the caravan intelligence network. The detection range and range of flying bats are also limited. At present, Richard may be hidden from the main force of Salenville. The location is quite clueless. However, since no enemy can be found, it is not as good as he expected. The move to turn back to the blue water oasis can definitely be beyond the expectations of Salenwell. Since the enemy can't find his whereabouts when he doesn't move, let him move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally decided so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrange the follow-up defense, the army is open. On the road of 100 kilometers, the enemies in the middle were cleared, so the army only went for more than two days and returned to the blue water oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is ready to wait here for the arrival of the Duke of the Wolf, and then complete the sacrifice ceremony. This will be able to tie the duke firmly to his chariot. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the Blood Flag Valley, the Sir Albert, who had the title of Imperial Iron Wall, waited for seven days, and did not see the Western Expeditionary Army of Richard appearing in front of the valley. At the beginning, he was rushed to the bloody valley to be deployed. In order to bring more equipment, even some of the supplies were abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before Sir Ars arrived in the Blood Valley, there was news that Richard had defeated the orcs in the Cracked Rock Canyon. Then Richard began to camp. According to Al’s prediction, the army of Richard will appear in front of the valley for a maximum of two or three days. In order to prevent Richard from discovering his own traces, Al even the reconnaissance cavalry received it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he waited for seven days! It doesn't take such a long time to take a long rest. The Blood Flag Valley is only over 50 kilometers away from the Cracked Rock Canyon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Al was so restless, Saranwell became equally anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information came, he did not expect that Richard actually dared to fight hard with the orcs of the Cracked Rock Canyon. What is there, except for the water and a small piece of land that can grow food, and the underground caves where mushrooms can be collected, there is only the smell and feces of the orcs. In order to make such a place where hair is not long, Richard actually will fight with tens of thousands of orcs! Has his head broken? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cracked Rock Canyon is the territory of the orc tradition. There are so many forces on the bloody land where humans come and go. Why don’t anyone go to crack the stone canyon? Not because it is not worth the candle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult orcs can be good fighters. Tens of thousands of orcs, Saranwell, with the strength of his hands, are not willing to lick this hard bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the style of Richard’s always doing things, it can be seen that he is meticulous and decisive, and he is far-sighted and never does anything unsure. Even more frightening is that until today, I have never heard of Richard’s defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how Saranwell can't figure it out, Richard is a big fight with the orcs of the Cracked Rock Canyon, and he wins, but his losses are quite It’s heavy, so stay in place. The result is a full seven days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidden in a hundred kilometers away, the summit of the Iron Triangle Empire's border city of Allenville is a complete dilemma. The place where Richard camped was well-connected, and the terrain was complex, which was not conducive to his army's expansion, but it was easy to escape. This kind of place is not an ideal place for decisive battle at all. The original intention of Salenwell was to attack a thousand miles, and then set a battle with the thunder, who thought that Richard actually took a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few days, the new information finally arrived, almost at the same time to reach the hands of Sirenwell and Sir Albert. At the moment of seeing the information, Salenwell only felt that it was black, and did not know what to say. Richard actually withdrew his troops!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first idea of ​​Salenwell was unbelievable, and the second thought was to withdraw General Sinton immediately. Although Hinton can also fight for good, but Saranwell does not think that with the thousands of people under theon, it will be the superior opponent of Richard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When General Sinton received an order from the Eagle, and 100,000 hurriedly withdrew from the Flintstone Forest, the whereabouts were naturally returned to the Lishui Oasis. Discover. Once the army of thousands of people moved, it is still very difficult to hold. It was only that Sinton’s march was extremely rapid, so that Richard could not catch up. Otherwise, Richard really wants to leave these thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
