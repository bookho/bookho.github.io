When Wald rushes to Richard, the double fist will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Richard, he has lost all the routes of dodge and counterattack, and all aggressive magic has no obvious effect on the boxing fighter under the protection of blood color energy. Now The only chance is to fight hard with Wald, but with the boxing fighters who are known for their attacking power and explosive power, the result is that they are made into bolognese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Wald’s double boxing, Richard saw death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Richard’s brain was blank, and all emotions were completely suppressed, leaving only the cold wisdom talent to deal with everything, all the blood and ability Excited, a bleak prison fire emerged from the lava. In the deepest part of the fire, Desmasson’s deity is shining, and the wells of the stars are no longer swaying, but roaring and enriching. The well water containing star power is sprayed out of the wellhead, and the three star-shaped stars are constantly vibrating. A large amount of energy is forcibly separated and integrated into the blood of Richard, constantly enhancing the power of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosive power that has not been used for a long time has been activated, and the shape of the body has obviously expanded, and it has an explosive power. The magic is directly filled into the magical armed forces, transformed into a force similar to vindictiveness, full of the whole body of Richard, and the life begins to stack and superimpose, so that Richard's hands are red and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a solemn, chilling, and scented breath emerged from the real name of Desmasson and spread instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little dark fire appeared from the moonlight blade, and the entire blade was smashed in an instant, and it was extended to the whole body of Richard. Then, with Richard as the center, it turned into a circle of fire. Spread out in all directions, where the fire waves pass, the ground crystallizes immediately, such as a shining diamond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and stared at Wald, who had already rushed to the front. When his eyes opened, everyone suddenly felt an indescribable feeling. The feeling passed over my heart, and the heart stopped beating in an instant, as strong as Asiris, and I felt the heart was bursting and unable to tell the uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when the positive Wald saw Richard's eyes, he was shocked. In his eyes, there were no pupils in his eyes. They were all flowing lava. Through Richard's eyes, you can see a complete abyss world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boxing screams of earth-shattering arrogance, the fists squat without change, only the space cracks that sputtered to the four sides quickly, this can be seen Fight the power of terror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s knife flashed, it seemed to move, and it didn’t seem to move. It’s just a flash, his people are already ten meters away. Behind Wald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boxing fighter’s fists slammed silently on the ground, and the ground immediately fell down, and the cracks radiated around, until dozens of meters were stopped. After a punch, with the boxing fighter as the center, there was a huge pit with a radius of tens of meters, which was as deep as ten meters. The whole process was not silent, as if the world was originally silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming sound, the moonlight rubbing on the ground, also broke the silence of the world, Richard hands scythe, the whole person can stand by the support of a long knife Steady, his face was red and white, and his mouth was full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde was so arrogant that he shook his big head, and the knot of the Kakakaka in his neck, he moved his body again, the same The squeaky bones blew out, then broke out and pulled the fists out of the ground and turned to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not even turned his strength, and the finger joints of the knife have been all blue and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two armies have already held their breath, watching the progress of the next, still leading the Raya of the knight, biting his teeth, reaching out and hanging on the devil The throwing spear, followed by his movements, all the knights at the same time took off the spears, ready to kill if Wald took another step, the two-packed knight's volley, is the legendary strong Can also be killed on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But an elite squadron next to the squadron suddenly slammed into the front of Laya, these elite squadron knights are full-time squadrons, The secret link of the soul link can be received by Richard's command. The instructions they give represent the will of Richard. The Raya face that has long been familiar with this point has changed, and finally slowly put down the hand that gripped the spear, but he In the dark, he made up his mind that if Richard really died under Wald's hands, then he would lead the knights to kill all the rebels, one will not stay, as for the honors lost by the disobedience and the failure to keep promises, Raya can all not give a damn about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wald took a step toward Richard and stopped. Then he laughed and said, "The kid is doing really well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence Just finished, a blood line suddenly appeared on the broad back of the boxing fighter, and the blood immediately splattered like a flag, extending a few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walde looked up to the sky, watching the sky that was reddish by the three sunsets, muttering something, and then slowly falling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, his huge body fell on the ground, and the dust splashed over the boxing fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield is still silent, Asiris walks forward, every step of the body will flash more than ten meters, after a few steps At the side of Richard, he released the healing therapies on Richard. After three treatments, Richard looked up and said, "I am fine, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Richard’s feet are constantly open with white mountain flowers. He has been able to use his power to pray and heal himself. Asiris nodded before he walked to the boxing fighters, kneeling down and opening the darkness. Code, began to mourn the scriptures, so as to send off for the former comrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raya raised a long gun and pointed it to the left and right. The knight was divided into two teams, and the left and right were swept to the army of Wald. With a long sword, the murderousness rises to the sky. With his movements, all the soldiers have pulled out their weapons, and at one time they are murderous and murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raya’s eyes, knowing that the enemy is the most difficult to deal with, these fighters may not be personally strong, but they will have a determination to fight the blood. However, he did not fear at all, clenched the rifle, and the light blue temper filled the whole body. As soon as Richard made a command, he would forcibly rush into the enemy line and use strength to run over the enemy's body. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the general glanced at the left and right knights, snorted, did not choose to fight, but reversed the sword in his hand and inserted it in On the ground, two thousand fighters put their weapons on the ground in the same way. This is the way they commemorate the comrades who died in battle. Wald was their commander in his life. When he died, he was beaten by each soldier. The comrades-in-arms commemorate, in a sense, this is the highest honor a general can harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard finally recovered some strength. He walked to Wald and looked at this hilly warrior. Wald was still round. With his eyes open, he seems to be watching the sky that is gradually covered by the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard also kneels beside Wald, gently put his hand on his thick chest like a city, whispering: "At the last blow, he took power, and I can't control it, so this one It’s not that simple, Achilles, go check, find all the relatives of Wald, see what they are doing now, is it threatened, no matter who is behind the scenes, I will let them pay ten times The price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you wish." Asiris is as respectful as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha stood up and looked at the undefeated meteorite highland defender and said, "Raya, first take them back to the barracks, then let all the generals Come see me, be prepared, and soon I will reorganize it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." When Raya took the lead, she was obscured by the bound knight. The army ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait." Richard called Raya and added: "Let them bring their own weapons."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raya glimpses, but still leads the way, the defenders are very surprised from the generals to the soldiers, and then most people seem to breathe a sigh of relief, allowing them to keep their own weapons, meaning Li The inspection does not regard them as rebel forces, but this is the essential difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening passed, night fell, the night became thicker, and then the night was deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the midnight, Richard and the five generals in the garrison talked one by one, and Wald’s body has converged and is ready to bring back Rand, buried in the family cemetery of the territory, through conversations with the generals, Richard also understood the basic situation of the meteorite highlands. The generals did not want to betray, and the force, strength and tolerance shown by Richard also won their Recognized, at this point, the high status of the meteorite has been re-accepted to Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finally could be alone, he first slammed the table and spit out a long-lost turbidity. This is not the result he wants, even It can be said that it is the worst result of the anticipation. Even if Wald is really rebelling, it is better than now. Wald is defeated and captured, but it is not necessarily dead. If you say it, you will be born and died with Gotton. The thirteen knights, Richard are willing to give them a good ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle at dusk, replayed in Richard's heart over and over again, Wald's blood-protection inspired by the overdraft of life is extremely resistant to magic. Force, while the sudden increase in strength and speed made Richard feel the deepest crisis. When his fists fell from the sky, the momentum in the moment was enough to tear the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
