The question, if answered, hurts the fundamental rules of my existence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two successive questions, Richard saw that there was less time on the altar. More than half. The second question, although the Eternal and the Dragon of Time did not answer, but was also counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately said: "I have completed the blood journey, and in accordance with the ancient tradition, I now ask you to give me the right and glory of living in the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a routine statement. According to past practice, after this sentence, the owner of the sacrifice will get a brand of time. This branding is equivalent to a key. It is a proof that you can enter and exit the floating island and live on the floating island. At the same time, you will have the right to function as a floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard finished the vows, the strange thing was that he did not get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the sound of the dragon of eternal and time is ringing again: "God is not enough to support your request, add sacrifices, or withdraw Request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, I did not expect this response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the request is of course impossible, but after the opening of the points redemption system, the Richards sacrifice is no longer awkward. The dragon and the great demon are full of sacrifices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard opened the space equipment and poured the sacrifices equivalent to the three top sacrifices on the altar. These sacrifices were originally intended to be exchanged for equipment to enrich the exchange system of the Archimonde family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offerings have turned into the power of time and flowed into the torrent of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Faustian suddenly vibrates, and the rainbow in July releases the eye-catching brilliance again. A beam of light emerges from the top of the Temple of Eternal Dragon and shines on a floating island. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating island was originally identical to other floating islands, but at this time a protective cover emerged around the beam, and then began to collapse, revealing the inner floating The true face of the island. On the floating island, the same light is shè, and the shè is on the rainbow in July. The floating island itself moves slowly and enters the predetermined trajectory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In FS, almost everyone took to the streets, or stood in front of the window, stunned and looked up at the huge floating island in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, everyone is looking up, because the trajectory of this floating island is far higher than that of FS, and on all other floating islands, Even under it, there is a whole layer of floating islands that have never been unsealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Island Unblocking! This is the floating island unblocking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole of the world, there are only a handful of long-lived veterans who have seen the last time the floating island was unsealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President of the Royal Masters Association, Tol, is one of them. At this moment he stood at the window and stared blankly at the energy that was constantly drawing from the rainbow in July. The floating island that started running, I didn’t know that the wine glass in my hand had already fallen into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...how is this possible..." Thor slammed his eyes and felt that he was cheated. . However, the scene he saw clearly told him that the floating island was the third floor, and it was the floating island in the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thor flew back to his lab, quickly spread the magic paper, and calculated it on the fly. He does not believe his eyes, he must have enough data to convince himself. But after counting it a few times, Thor felt that he couldn't believe the data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the altar of the Eternal Dragon Temple, when Richard took over the golden sè light ball that represented the floating island, it was also a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old dragon said that the sacrifice was not enough, he knew that he might get a high floating island, and maybe even more than the royal floating island. But in his expectations, it is at most 5-1 or the floating island of 5-2. I never thought that the dragon of eternal and time gave him 3-1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a glory, and a testament to Richard’s position in the face of Eternal and Time Dragon, but the problem is that this glory does not seem to mean anything to him. In addition to the larger area of ​​the high-rise floating island, what can be used? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragon seems to know Richard’s thoughts and says, “This is a special reward for you, because only the first three layers of floating islands are It's really special. They have some of the permissions to control the floating world, so they have extraordinary abilities. You will know when you step on the floating island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;“Cāo control floating world?” Richard sharply captured a key word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. This sentence is also a part of your reward. Therefore, trying to gain the grace of God and jumping to the floating island is the only way to gain the great power of fait. The way. When you climb the first floating island on the first floor, you will know the truth of Faust. In addition, if you want to return to the sand, a lot of grace is the only choice. Your present grace is not enough." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling that the will of the Eternal and Time Dragon will fade away like a water, and Richard hurriedly shouted: "How much grace does it have?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eternal and Time Dragons burst into a low-pitched laughter, and then went away, and did not answer the question of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The altar gradually restored the original appearance of the ruins, and Richard took a moment to walk outside the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, the dragon of eternal and time seems to be particularly fond of him. But Richard doesn't know if this is a good thing. If you only look at the examples of predecessors, such as Philip and Vatican, then this is probably not a good thing. But what the old dragon gave, always made him difficult to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the altar, Nolan is waiting there. At this time, she looked at Richard's gaze, which was already very complicated. Among them, there were joys, envy, and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard is coming, Nolan said: "Richard, hopes to see you, she has something to say to you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha's eyebrows are slightly wrinkled. He had no good feelings for hope, and the great priest had an extraordinary interest in rights and yīn, and last time he stupidly put his mind on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Richard did not know the great significance of his space lord title. After no face reminder, he really understood the level of power in the eternal dragon temple. Architecture. Strictly speaking, except for the gods and his title holders, other priests are dispensable. It seems that many people, including these big priests themselves, do not seem to realize this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is she doing?" asked Li. He has no time to waste on a woman who is already dispensable and not smart enough, although her chest is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's about Ryan. Ryan has corrected a lot now. And she thinks that Ryan is the best person to become a god. So I hope to see you and get your support."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Nolan and said faintly: "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan smiles: "God Where is we able to intervene? Ryan is indeed very talented, but talent does not mean everything. However, hopes have been supported by ten floating island giants, so when the sacrifice, God graces Ryan to tilt this piece Things should be implemented soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately understood, sneer: "She is using other floating islands to pressure me." , huh, huh!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan’s heart suddenly inexplicably chills, and she discovers that Richard is completely different from the past. He just stood still, and the huge sense of oppression was enough to make people suffocate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan suddenly remembered that Richard had just forced all the giants to have a courageous battle in front of the bloody road, and there were rumors that he had defeated the undecided . Such people, don't say that now, even in the past, is it that some floating island giants can unite to suppress it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly said: "Ryan is it? Then, call him, let Xi Xi and other big gods come over, just discuss this. "Things!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nolan opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but he couldn’t say a word, he had to turn and hurried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the hall of the Eternal Dragon Hall zhōng yāng, the priests and shrine knights who have visited him, and most of them do not know how to be good. Some will come up with greetings, while others will rush around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, hope and two other great priests came to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside them, Ryan has faded a lot of greens, and people have grown taller and become a mature and stable teenager. His appearance is more biased towards his mother. It is very beautiful. Although it is not like Nyris, it is a beautiful woman who has fallen into the country, but it is also quite temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Richard, Ryan immediately took a step forward and said, "I am very honored to see you again. Your brilliant journey of bloody journey will be a must." Will shine in the history of the Holy Alliance! I made some mistakes when I was young, I hope to get your forgiveness. In the past, many families with a long history in the Holy Alliance gave me a lot of guidance and help in the future. I also hope that you can get your guidance and support as well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the performance of this boy is impeccable, and he is really talented. I don’t know which level of experience I have experienced. It’s already 18th. Great god official. He took off the tenderness, and he was more calm and bold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The juvenile’s words are also beautiful, and the reality of the many giants’ support has been pointed out. If Richard does not support him, it will be the same as these floating island giants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard’s strength has now reached the point where Ryan’s deep hatred is hidden, but how can he escape the perception of Richard ? Even if he really passed Richard, Richard wouldn't think that a guy who dared to take his own squad when he was twelve or three years old would really become tame and harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the strong suppression of the past, or the positive display of Ryan now, the purpose is actually the grace of Richard. It is no wonder that Greek and Ryan always remember the grace of Richard. He accumulates wealth and gets sacrifices too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have not left the Holy Alliance, Richard’s sacrifice is equivalent to one-third of all floating islands. After Richard was promoted to the St. Architect, he developed a point redemption system. On the number of sacrifices, he could overwhelm all the floating islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Ryan’s eyes and suddenly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS1: Thanks to the new ally g_bit, Congratulations is to love the singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS2: Today is Christmas Eve, two years ago at this moment, "Sin City" released a prologue, more than 700 rì nights accompany you through ,Thank you everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
