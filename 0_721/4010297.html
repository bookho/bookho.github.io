The entire long street, here is the only shop to open the door. When he walked into the store, he found that it was still the same as the last one. The shelves were mostly empty, and only a few very inconspicuous pieces were placed to show that it was indeed a storefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after Richard’s random sweep, he was shocked and couldn’t help but look at it. It’s true that these equipments that are thrown on the shelves are actually epics. level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a hoarse voice in the middle: "Who is it? Do you want to sell things? You wait a while, I am busy now. !啧啧! This leg is really long and straight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old and colorful voice belongs to Lawrence, so Richard said: "Master Lawrence I am Richard. Is White Night here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Richard!" Lawrence rushed out from the inside and looked up and down. The eyes are even more ecstatic: "You kid can actually run here alone! It's amazing, let me see your level, um, 16th grade, good! Speed ​​is fast! This upgrade speed, almost No, I am slower than Laozi, and I look at the Holy Alliance. It may be that Su Hailun’s little girl is faster than you. How come you came, have you got the squad of the bear’s first superintendent?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, Lawrence is already looking forward to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and shook his head and said, "No, I have the strength to deal with the bear chief." I am looking for the White Night to finish with her. The agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree?" Lawrence looked at Richard's gaze suddenly became unspeakable, then nodded and pulled a husky scorpion Cried: "White night! Your little lover is coming to see you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weak voice came from inside: "Lee? You come in!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence took a shot on Richard’s back and said, “Go, go in! She’s not very convenient now.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shop itself is not big, there are only three rooms. But because of the size of the aborigines in the days of the sun, every house here is like a hall for Norand humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the innermost one, you need to walk through the long corridor of up to 20 meters. Then Richard saw a small house that stood in the hall. The building materials looked like wood and stone. The handwork couldn't be said how fine, the surface was not even polished, and the natural texture of the wood stone was exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at first glance, Richard found that it was a bit strange. He’s always proud of his ability to perceive and detect in front of this hut, without any reaction. . When they came to the near side, Richard recognized most of the categories in the stone wood by his eyesight. They were all very rare magic materials, with excellent isolation magic and sensory detection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence opened the door and gestured to Richard to let him in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard got into the hut and saw the white night at first sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white night body is now lying on a metal bed in the middle of the cottage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a weak breath and she has dozens of wounds. The wounds are no longer bleeding, but the rolled flesh shows a bleak blue-white color that looks terrible. What shocked Richard was that the chest of the white night was cut open, supported by a metal bracket, and the internal organs were still slowly creeping. . It can be seen that in the chest of the white night, there are three hearts in a triangular shape, of which only one heart can still beat normally, and the other two hearts will wriggle after a good interval. Every time you move, you will have a lot of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee lost the voice: "White night, how did you become like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night side Too much, I even showed a smile to Richard, and said faintly: "I am still alive, it is the biggest good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Richard, Lawrence screamed heavily With one voice, he said, "If you don't have me, it will be strange if you can live this time! Kid, stand there and don't get in the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence put Richard pushed aside and reached for the wash in the basin next to him. He picked up a silver sharp dagger and reached into the chest of the white night directly, picking up a viscera that Richard could not even identify. Cut it with a dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence was once a sacred architect. Now, although his hands are not stable enough, he can still see the exquisite skills of the year. The dagger cuts off a piece of thin paper-like slice from the internal organs. Each time a piece is cut, the dagger is gently picked, and the purple-black visceral slice flies up and falls into the trash can at the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on?" Richard looked horrified and couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on!" Lawrence snorted heavily and said with hate: "This madman, nothing to fight for the legendary strongman, the result Now it has become like this! I haven’t closed my eyes for ten days, so I saved this madman back. You also see the current situation, I guess I have to work hard for three or four days to fully take this guy’s I will give it back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night said faintly: "But the legend is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence is angry again: "Oh, you are amazing! Now you can kill the legend, but what about it? If you have Laozi, you can still live today. You can't wait another two years? In a few years, you are not a legend. When you are dead or alive, you are always embarrassed to come back to me. And Laozi has not done you, if you die first, am I not losing money?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night no longer cares about Lawrence, but turns to Richard and says, "Is life finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;In her voice, there was a bit more tension and anticipation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha nodded: "Do it well, a total of four."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four! Very good !! White night, excited, actually want to lift the upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move!" Lawrence screamed, and the white night had to lie back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence hates to put a bottle of unknown ingredients as pure water, but there are countless tiny particles of liquid pouring into her chest, which immediately rises There was a smog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard can see that the body of the white night is instinctively twitching, obviously painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence is even more furious, saying: "Life is absolutely extinct! If you are willing to wait for a while, plus life, how can you hurt like this! Wait, life is absolutely ruined! Richard Cha, where did you get the life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha, said: "I did it." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you do? You made life awkward? You have been able to make a life extinct? Damn, how old you are now!" Lawrence Howl I almost jumped out of my hand when I held the bottle in one hand and grabbed the dagger. Scared that Richard quickly pressed the old man, lest he hurt the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night suddenly sighed and said: "Old man, I am sorry. I saw him, there is no way to control myself, I must kill him personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence nodded and said, "I know. But if you have a life, you will not be so embarrassed if you make a fool later. You little lover." It’s really amazing. Now I can make a life annihilation, and it’s four shots. It’s not like watching him for a few years. It’s Laozi’s... oh!! Laozi was naturally stronger than him. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence turned his head and said to Richard: "Hey, kid, since you have made life, you are the third-order magical arm." Can you make it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha opened his clothes and revealed a piece of his body, saying, “It’s already here.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence nodded and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night suddenly said: "Li Cha, I only gave you three sacrifices, but you made four lives. Oh, let me think about it. ... the old man, lend me something in your box! I have to pay the account of Little Richard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence snorted and said: "Let you? You still got it! For so many years, have you owed me less? Is there more than one life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence’s mouth It was very rude, but he turned his head and said to Richard: "Hey, Richard, there is a box outside, you can pick one thing inside, but if you can arm the fifth-order magic in the future. If you give it, the things inside are all yours. The original box I was prepared to leave for the night after death, but your two little guys are obviously unclear, it seems to give you and give her It's all the same. Go now, you have three minutes to pick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already taken enough." Richard frowned slightly, refused Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, three pieces of top-level sacrifices were exchanged for four pieces of life, which is a big deal from the market price. But for Richard, his total cost is only about 10 million. 200% of the profits in the construction industry is not shocking, but because of the huge base, let Richard also feel that earning too much. And seeing how the white night is now, I know how her rich family came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night said faintly: "I don't care what your life costs, these four lives are absolutely priceless for me. A top festival In exchange for a product, I think it is already a big profit. Go take it, three minutes, don't waste time. I have something to say to you after I come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hehe hesitated, went outside the hut, and saw a broken box full of rust. This thing is placed in a place like the absolute battlefield. It is estimated that no one is interested to open it and take a look. The box is not locked, the buckle has long been deformed, and it is not buckled at all, so the cover is hidden. As soon as Richard pushed, the lid of the lid was opened, and then a scent of rancid scent came over and let him almost spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
