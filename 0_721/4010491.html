			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha finally understood the meaning of the old man, if the fifth-order magic If the armed design is successful, then the world may know the design plan for him. No matter who spends the price and purchases a fifth-order structure, it must consider the problem of repairing once damaged in the future, so the customer of Richard is equal to his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee asked Lawrence to delve into the design drawings, and he was free to find a room, set up a news alert, and began to meditate, since entering the big After the magician's realm, Richard has just digested the new ability, and now has time to start practicing 'Deep Blue Meditation', which is a meditation for the big magician. At first, Su Hailun once said that deep blue meditation is the real meditation. The introduction, as for the previous dark blue fantasy, is completely created when she is okay, in the attitude of anyway than the general meditation effect, she naturally can not spend too much thought on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the study, Richard found that the deep blue meditation is far more profound than the dark blue fantasy, and the light is the first step, placing himself in a state of silence and ethereality. In order to resonate with the world around the soul, it is very difficult. Li originally thought that he had the foundation of deep blue fantasy. This step should not be very difficult, but he did not expect the essence of dark blue meditation, all magic instantly changed. It has to be heavy and stagnate, and there is a tendency to concentrate, so that the magic operation becomes extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed some inexplicable hearts and began to sort out his magic bit by bit, remembering that Su Helun taught him the dark blue series of meditation. At that time, I once said that once I broke through the first level, I will show a completely different world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the truth of the world, she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Su Helun feels that this is a level, it is naturally very difficult, Richard gradually closes his mind, put all the thoughts in the dust completely, slowly consciousness Just like if you don't get into the sea, the surrounding area is getting darker. There is no danger in the deep sea. If the magic of Richard's magic is slightly messed up, it will lead to the hard-won meditation realm, and it will take a lot of time to re-sedicate. At this stage, the Dark Blue series of meditation has been completely different from other meditations in the mainland. Richard now has some doubts about the racial identity of the legendary mage. Such special meditation is probably tailored to her race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and time again, time passed quietly. Richard himself consciously forgot the number of failures. I don’t know how long it took, and Richard suddenly entered a strange realm, it was dark, pure and transparent. In the dark, he could not feel where his body was, only the consciousness was hanging in the darkness of the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness suddenly becomes more transparent and far-reaching, and Richard can feel that his consciousness can be stretched out, and can stretch infinity and deep into the darkness. It seems to depend only on guts, but the longer the consciousness stretches, the more fear Richard is. It is a terrible feeling that cannot be said. It seems that at any time it is possible to get lost in the dark and never return to his body. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there is a sudden blue in the dark world. In the boundless darkness, the blue color is so conspicuous that it is impossible to be Ignored, Richard stared at the blue color with full concentration, and felt that the blue light seemed to move, changed the trajectory, and flew to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue dot flies closer and closer, and later becomes a blue light ball, and then grows bigger and bigger, when it floats in front of Richard, Richard It was discovered that this group of blue light was wrapped in a blue planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet is round and flawless, with a blue-gray color, and a ring of halo around it, which is slowly rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an indescribable scene. Intuition tells Richard that this planet is so huge that even if the whole Noland continent is placed on it, it is more than enough. It is in the face of Richard, but it is as big as an apple. Doesn't that say that Richard himself is much bigger than the entire Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So reason has easily rejected this illusion, but Richard faintly feels that this does not seem to be an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to break a glimpse of consciousness and entangle the planet, just as he wandered the stars in dark blue fantasy, where the planet shook and slowly changed. In the direction, flying to Richard, Li looked down and watched it slowly fall into his own 'body', saying that it was the body. In fact, it was just a large piece of boundless black fog, but the planet was entangled in black fog. After that, it will not move, but will rotate quietly. Occasionally, it will radiate a star-like energy. Richard’s consciousness tracks this energy, so he actually sees a small one in his body. With a blue light spot, he constantly zooms in on the light in the field of view, and gradually the light spot becomes clearer and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually a well, an ancient well built on a floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of Gujing is very familiar, and Richard immediately recognizes that this is the well of the stars that Saron corresponds to. From the wellhead, you can see that there is a clear water inside. It is emitting a mist of water with a strong star power. At this time, there is a burst of star power, and the well water of the wells of the stars immediately swells, and the water mist is also rich. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha finally understands that the deep blue meditation was originally to capture these floating planets and then provide them with stable star power. If the number of stars is sufficient, then The speed of magic growth is naturally faster, but Richard still has too many places to understand, such as where is this dark world, how come he comes, and where the planets come from, why can they be themselves? capture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does they really be a planet, and if not, why can they significantly increase their star power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has waited for a long time, but he has never seen the second planet again, so with these questions, Richard is ready to withdraw from the world of meditation. However, at this moment, a little dark red suddenly appeared in the darkness. A new planet flew out. Unlike the blue-gray quiet planet, this new planet is dark red, spinning fast, and The flight path is irregular. When it is flying close, Richard sees that its surface is full of huge cracks, constantly ejecting the rising molten fire column from the inside, and at first glance, it is known that the planet is on the verge of destruction. But what kind of power can destroy it like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked out again and tried to capture it, but consciousness wrapped the burning star, and Richard immediately screamed in the world of nothingness. At one click, the planet was full of burning fire, and with the consciousness of Richard, Richard only felt that he was holding a burning red fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the burning planet changed its trajectory and flew to Richard. Richard felt a sharp pain again. This time it was like being stuffed in the body. A fireball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wells of the Stars have changed immediately, the wells are violently violent, and the wells are constantly smearing, and Richard knows the burning of the planet at this moment. What is power, it is the origin of the dusk land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the plane is naturally not to be said to be powerful, the power of the out-of-control plane is also extremely violent, and Richard is not easy to control the burning planet. The amount of violent violence that was sprayed around, and finally had to leave the third consciousness to control the origin of this plane. Richard had little knowledge of the world of meditation, and he did not know how long this plane can remain, but already After a lot of time, Richard felt that he needed to end the meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard opened his eyes, it was the magic clock that looked at the time. It was already seven days passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Richard saw the old face of Lawrence at the door, and asked him to come in and asked, "I meditated for seven days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence looked at each other and said, "Then you think, deep meditation on the battlefield, want to find death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and said apologetically: "I didn't think of a small accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted, Put a few design drawings into the hands of Richard and say, "This is some of the gadgets I have come up with in the past few days. It can be used with your magical armed forces. Your magical armed design is already Very perfect, there is nothing to change, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawrence looked at Richard from the perspective of the monster, and said for a long time: "You Adjusting the energy output so high, and adding four additional output channels, it seems that your body is not much weaker than the bear's first warlord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, resilience is justified." Richard said, while looking at the design drawings that Lawrence handed over, he is now a master in the field of construction, and immediately sees the core ideas of these designs, they are small structures. Almost no bearing capacity is required, and it can be attached to other construction positions at will, mainly to provide various assistance to the magical armed forces. They do not have their own energy output magic array, but they are driven by collecting the energy of the magical armed overflow. The more I look at it, the more I admire it. Lawrence is truly creative. I broke the routine in many fields. If it wasn’t for the serious injury caused by his death with the legendary Master Daksodars, it must have been true now. The holy builder is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence said: "You will stay here for two more days. Let’s take a look at these designs. If you have any ideas, we can discuss them. I can only design them now. The design of the things can not be done by themselves, it is inevitable that there are some places that are not well thought out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and began to study these small pieces In the structure, these small structures are filled with the energy of the excess overflow, which is stored and, when necessary, can provide a little magic, and some will wash away the extra energy, and the other three are as Lawrence said. It is used to provide pure 'light and shadow effects'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
