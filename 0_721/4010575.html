			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day of the battle is over, this is a surprise for Richard The situation, although his construction knight played a huge power, and broke the guardian elves, but Richard was trapped under the tree of life, this time Lin Hai chose a smarter way, no longer directly attacking Li Inspecting the soul, but fighting in the way of suppressing the opponent and strengthening the already side, under the strong forest will, the strength of all the guardian elves has greatly increased, and the high-level shooter of the 16th level or above has a full blow, there is a holy The power of the field hunter's attack, this kind of attack, the construction of the knight wants not to be hurt, you have to use the power of the wild barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restoration of the power of the Holy Unicorn will take two days. With its help, Richard is not afraid of the siege of the guardian spirit, and has the confidence to kill a Bloody road, back to the forward base, once it reached the forward base, there was no suppression of the forest will. At that time, the guardian elves came to die, and how many killed, but the road to return to the base is far away, the battle must be continuous, strong There is nothing in the knights of the structure, but many old people, women and children in the Yongye tribe cannot bear such a journey, and they will inevitably suffer heavy casualties. In addition, the migration of the Yongyao Tree of Life is also a big problem, the life in the process of migration. The tree can't provide enough shelter, and the engine power is also very problematic. It can't play the characteristics of building a knight to go like a wind and aggression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard found that he couldn’t leave unless he was willing to pay a big price. In addition, the lost follower doesn’t know where he is now, the only thing that makes him A little peace of mind is that no matter whether it is twilight, tiramisu or mountains and sea, it is not a fierce in the general sense. Even in the depths of the forest, there is a suppression of the forest will, it is not easy to kill them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard was not prepared to leave too early. He transferred Ellie to Greenson and assembled hundreds of knights. Showing off, but really eager to kill, guardian elves are sparsely populated, the strategy of eliminating the power of life is extremely suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the Yongyue Life Tree, Richard is ready to let the guardian elves flow first-class blood on this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, the forest calmed down unexpectedly, except for the occasional cold arrows that were quietly shot, the guardian elves did not have big moves, but the sky Still dark, like entering the night, no more dawn, the dark sky means that the suppression of the forest will never fade, and every night elf can be keenly aware of this suppression, they are in the tree of life. I still don't feel abnormal when I am down, but as soon as I get close to the edge of the forest, I feel a bit of chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the night elves know that now entering the forest is undoubtedly a dead end, and Richard is doing more thoroughly. He even withdraws the elf hunters who are crouching on the edge of the tree crown of the tree of life, and they are stationed in the middle of the canopy. This way, if the peripheral edge is given to the guardian elves, Richard's approach is like treating the night elves as flowers in the greenhouse, carefully caring for them, but there are also many pride and fearless life and death in the Yongye tribe. Warriors, they asked for war several times through Merlin and so on, but they were all rejected by Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been so calm for a few days, the guardian elves have new moves, they don’t know where to learn the strategy, they actually sent a few big tricks. The hunter and Druid started to insult the Elves and Richard, and the insults included the embarrassing embarrassment. For the elves who have always been elegant, this is unimaginable, but the effect of this strategy. Unexpectedly, all the night elves are boiling, and the number is called to fight with the guardian elves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Richard immediately no longer hesitated, but personally brought two hundred knights and rushed into Yulinhai. The water flower naturally followed the inside of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lin Haizhong is also dark, almost no fingers, but in the eyes of the guardian elves, the forest is full of light, you can see the most delicate leaves The context, in this environment, the eyes have not played much of a role, more need to rely on perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deep forest, I really encountered the ambush of the guardian elves. When a sharp whistle sounded through the forest, countless whistle began in Linhai. One after another, one by one in the canopy, flying like a fly, to the team of Richard, the land of the forest is shaking, the ancient tree is activated into a tree, there are more real war trees The beast cavalry of the guardian elves rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the enemies that are surrounded by them, feeling the heavy pressure of the forest, the ears are still echoing the guardian elves’ bitterness, and Richard slowly pulls out The knife has a magma surge in the depths of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who shouted the first “kill.” I don’t know who the first blood splashed, and the melee has broken out in the forest. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night, under the tree of life at night, almost all the elves of the night come out from the shelter, surrounded by the tree of life, touching them with their hands and with their bodies. The mother tree, the elves are all sharp, they feel that the earth is always trembled, and those high-level hunters can detect the turbulent turbulence in the forest will, which means that a fierce battle is erupting in the distance, and the war even affects here. Forest will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elders, for the Yongye tribe, or for the self, it is not important in the mind of the Eternal Elf. Richard took his knight and went to the deep battle of Lin Hai as an insult to the guardian elves. The response of the elders, even the Eternal Night Elf knows that there will be an ambush in the depths of the forest. How can Richard not know, but he still goes, with his knight, the line of straight and tall riding, deep and profound Printed in the heart of every elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the tree of life, Ellie is sitting next to the sharpening stone, struggling to polish her own sword, and the sword has long been sharply sharp, but she But still do not know the satisfaction, never endlessly grinding, as if to make this long sword to become the sharpest artifact in the adult, the thin sweat has been densely covered with Alice's forehead, the red short hair is wet with sweat, tight Close to the full forehead, a general came over. He glanced at the long sword that had been worn over and couldn't help but ask: "Adult, you have something to worry about."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." The general wisely decided not to continue the topic, but to ask Another thing that has been worried about: "Adult, if Richard can't come back, what should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噶吱, the hand of Ellie The long sword suddenly twisted into a twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Countess’s eyes have been fixed on the general who has followed her for many years, and said in a very cold voice: "How do you know that he will not come back." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This general is also a long-time squad, although only seventeen, but if he was not seriously injured in his youth, he was already a Sanctuary. Therefore, regardless of personal strength and marching, it is a temporary choice. He does not care about the feelings of Alize, and bluntly said: "It is very simple, the will of the forest, the number of the enemy and the enemy, and the inevitable Ambush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three factors together, it is indeed possible for Richard to be completely annihilated, and the construction of the knight is not really invincible, even if the number is huge, It is difficult to offset the effects of adverse environments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice stared at him and said in a word: "If Richard does not return, then you will send these knights and elves. In the base city, I don't care what you do, but I must send them back to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general immediately became stunned and asked: "The grown-up What about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, Ellie took out a new long sword and began to polish it. She said, "I will go to the place where Richard died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The general took a sigh of relief and wanted to say something, but found that he could not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed by in a minute, and in the long wait, even if I felt that time passed slower, it was already one day and one night passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha still has no news, he and his knights are like disappearing in the forest, the night elves are beginning to uneasily commotion because they I know that when life is swallowed up by the forest, it is like this disappearing silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s another day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice has already ruined seven long swords, and she finally decided not to wait. When Richard left, he left a hundred and fifty The knight assisted in guarding the tree of life and handed over the defensive responsibility to Alice. In the past, Ellie had never let Richard down, she was constantly developing the territory, but in Noland, and It wasn't in a sub-planet that couldn't be named, but this time, Ellie felt that she had to disappoint Richard once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired female warrior is neatly tidy and turned over to the war horse. Under her severe swearing, all the generals and the knights are standing still. The land, overwhelmed, the night elves have packed up and placed them on the back of the magic rider and the beast. The night tree of life is swaying the leaves, as if to make the last land that has been rooted for hundreds of years. Say goodbye, when the horn sounds, the tree of life will shake its huge body, pull out the deep roots, and embark on a long journey of migration. It’s just that this road is hard to go. I don’t know how many people will be able to Live back to the base city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice has already sent the horse to the forest, but at this moment, the black mist that lingers on the edge of the forest bursts open, and a sly magic ride from the black Jumping out of the fog, falling on the greenery between the forests, this is the magic ride, it is lowered its head, the four hoofs are uneasily planing the grass, and the breath in the nose and the ribs constantly spurts white mist from it. From time to time, there are large drops of dark liquid dripping, which looks like blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the person on the back of the magic ride, Ellie finally screamed: "Licha,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really Richard on the back of the magic rider. With a charming smile, his back is always so straight, even if his face is pale, the wound from the ear to the chest is still flowing with blood and water. Cover his edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
