			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veterans look at Richard, look at the black-pressed knight, then look Looking at the ruins that were removed around the portal, suddenly there was a sadness in the inexplicable heart. In the Gordon era, they had the ability to have status, and they were not afraid of death. They also accumulated countless military merits, and the cost of the passage was high. Underneath, it is impossible to reinforce any support from Noland, so they are propping up the backbone of the battlefield of Hughland. These veterans are unruly, sometimes even the orders of Senma are not in the heart, they can make them convinced, also It’s only one Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, there is no deliberate reinforcement of the plane channel, but Richard directly pulls in a complete and incomparably elite army, which means what means These veterans are no longer able to control the middle forces of the planes. In other words, they are dispensable and there is nothing to bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights coming out of the portal, all of them are exquisitely exaggerated, and the knights are all shining with magic all over the body, as for followers They, their equipment can no longer be described as gorgeous, the power generated by epic equipment fluctuates, as long as a slightly sensitive person can appreciate it, compared with them, the generals of Hulan are also so cold as a country. Poor boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that came out of the portal was a star that was three meters in diameter but ten meters long. The behemoth floated silently in the air, but More stress than anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is very cold and very bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The porch is surrounded by ruins. The past era has been completely buried under the rubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans are the experiencers of the old times and the witnesses of the new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the army has all arrived, Richard immediately turned over the holy unicorn and said to Senma: "You gather the army and then come, we don't rest." Go straight and go to the next camp overnight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master Richard." Since getting the new armor, Senma has changed his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Li’s instructions, he led the followers and the Cavaliers to the base city and rushed to the first camp dozens of kilometers away. Looking away, this gave a glance to the restless veterans, and sighed and walked to his command building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senma adults, wait, what do we do." Several veteran veterans stopped the horses of Semir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to do." Semma sighed, knowingly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several veterans look at each other and one of them says, "That, Richard...the adult, are you going to fight?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma nodded and said: "Yes, this time, Richard is determined to break through the Valley of God and cry to the Nest."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this..." The veteran wanted to say how this could be, but then I thought that it would be impossible to rely on them more than a hundred veterans alone, but Li Chaguang was a knight who pulled out a hundred rides. This is the real big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the adult of Richard to fight, then we, Senma, you will bring us, yes." Another veteran asked uneasily. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Senma sighed and decided to tell the truth: "You will stay at the base."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we are warriors, not guards." The veterans are all screaming, but this time it is different, not so much a threat, but rather a pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave at the base, this is the order." Senma's tone has no room for negotiation. The veterans can only let go and look at each other. They all saw uneasiness from the depths of the other's eyes, and then slowly dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma has already understood the meaning of Richard. The most hated of Richard, who is good at the precise command of the battlefield, is the savage military, the unmanned warrior, even if the individual strength is stronger. It is also resolutely abandoned. The reason why Richard’s growth is that it is no longer necessary to declare that these veterans are no longer needed. Although these veterans can still receive generous treatment because of their accumulated merits, the battlefield is their embodiment. The place of value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma returned to the command and immediately began to mobilize the army. This time she only transferred a thousand highly mobile, light and elegant troops, and then began to collect the accumulated supplies. In order to prepare for war, but when Senma took up the inventory of war materials, there was still a god, and a large amount of materials were accumulated in the warehouse, but this amount was measured by the standards of the Gordon era. Senma knows that there is also a large amount of war preparations in the belly of the star, which is enough to support Richard to fight a high-intensity war. The star has been strengthened by a large number of shadow drills, and the materials stored in the body are nearly 1,000 tons. More than one, the quality is high, not even the original materials of Hughland can be compared, perhaps because the impact on Senma is not enough, Richard even stuffed dozens of tons of fresh beef in the star body, this is the supply The food of the elite knights, but as long as they are cooked, they are the top food for human warriors. As long as they reach the strong knights of the knights, they are even more willing to eat raw meat directly. Their powerful body can deal with various foods. Raw was able to bring a richer nutrients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the materials on the list, although the quality is not as good as the one prepared by Richard in the star, but Senma decided to do his best, so he spent more than an hour to draw up a logistics supply plan, which will be in the warehouse. Half of the materials were transferred, and a logistics force of more than 3,000 people was set up to transport and protect these materials. From this logistics plan, we can see the military literacy of Semir. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is well prepared, and the logistics team can start tomorrow morning. The strategic materials that are lost in the warehouse must be completed by Richard. Of course, according to Xin A Kemond’s standard, looking at the plan in his hand, Senma is sighing. She understands that there is a star in the hand of Richard, logistics is not a problem, but she still has to do this, nothing more than for those who have been fighting for The veterans of Hughland strive for a little performance, just like a coveted lion. The minions are no longer sharp. Only by the empty roar to remind the people around them, it has once been magnificent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha came to Shulan, brought a star, and brought the horrible knights, who were originally stationed in Shulan’s more than 20,000 warriors. The sons have lost their role, and their greatest use, perhaps occupying the territory, stabilizing the situation, the most difficult and most critical battles, has not been able to reach them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma raised a pair of long legs, habitually threw it on the desk, looking up at the ceiling, the bottom of the heart and the veterans were faintly lost, the entire Hulan Garrison, in the eyes of Richard, perhaps she only has some value, Richard has a squandered military expenditure, no matter which plane, material and realistic people are many, as long as Richard is willing to pay, you can recruit A large army, the hundreds of unruly veterans in the base city, and ordinary warriors differ only in their will, experience, and loyalty to Archimonde, but they can deal with twice the enemy but cannot deal with it. Three times, four times the enemy, but Richard can easily recruit tens of thousands of troops, and then armed them to the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma’s eyes passed the ruins in front of the portal, and Gordon was gone. It’s the time of Richard, the two generations of Archimonde Different styles, the traces of belonging to Gotton may be less and less, and there will be more and more people belonging to Richard. Everyone, including Senma, is faced with choices and cannot grow up with the new era. The old era is dying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sen Ma Teng stood up, picked up the sabre and hung it on his waist, and strode out to the command post. The army had already assembled and she would lead They rushed through a long road of wind and snow and met with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
