In his hand, it became a dragon call." Gordon gave the answer quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, your teacher had just entered the legend, and there was something small with our Archimonde family... um, friction. At that time I was also Young and eager to win, so I took the six equally energetic little guys in the family to fight with her. At that time we were not legendary, but the number is enough, the professional mix is ​​also good, plus the total strength and legend In the first battle, Su Hailun was just entering the legend, and there was only one legendary magic. After this magic was let go, she was just a peak-level big magician. Although some of us will definitely die under her legendary magic, but When did the real Archimonde fear death?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorton looked up and stared out the window, telling the story. In his face, there is casual publicity and pride. The seven young Archimonde dared to fight against the legendary mage, not only at that time, but at all times, it was proof of courage. Of course, most of the time, courage and recklessness are an inseparable twin, perhaps with a stupid sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after pride, Gordon’s face was replaced with a smile, slowly saying: “Your teacher’s first legendary magic is red. The dragon summoned. The opening of the battle was very classic. The big magisters in our time stopped using the same time to stop the time of Su Helun’s time. Then she relied on the absolute advantage of the speed of casting to limit our actions with group restraint. And open any door to telemeter to 100 meters, complete her legendary magic. When her spell is half, we know that it is the red dragon summoned, we even felt the hope of victory! After all, red The dragon itself has no legendary power. We can use two people to hold it, and then the rest concentrate on the legendary mage. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon is struggling The expression, obviously, the shadow left by him in that battle was not small: "When her spell is completed, there are three dragons in front of us! It includes a red dragon and two black dragons! Then... then it is very Simple, three dragons rushed over In the process, all of you have fallen down. In the process, your lovely teacher has started to eat fruit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li took a mouthful Cool, shocked: "Why there are three dragons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also learned later that her blood ability is actually a very rare summoning master! Therefore, the ordinary red dragon summoned her hand into a dragon call, not only the black dragon, the dragon species above the red dragon, but also more than one. Of course, there is no difference between the two heads and the three dragons. Gotton sighed and shook his head, then smiled at Richard and said, "If she casts a dragon call now, she must not only call out three dragons. Boy, you understand now, who is If you want to fight with your teacher alone, then you will not be able to go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fighting power of the adult red dragon is actually similar to the samurai warrior. Strength fluctuates between 18 and 20. Therefore, in the battle of the legendary strong, more than one red dragon is a powerful boost, but it is not enough to decide the battle. But more than three red dragons can definitely decide the battle. The strength of the adult black dragon is stable at the 20th level. It is the closest to the legendary existence. It is much stronger than the Red Dragon. Each additional black dragon has the power to reverse the situation, let alone two heads and three heads? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s downfall is that the teacher of Richard is actually the one who is the least concerned about single-handedness, but the talent of others is so powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, between Su Helun and Gordon, Richard will definitely stand on the side of Su Helun. He immediately expelled the bad thoughts and then asked the end of the war: "And then? How many of you died?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon smiled, Said: "One is not dead. There is not a big contradiction between the two sides, and your teacher does not like to kill, but prefers to do business. She not only let us go, but even gave us a sum of money. It is used as the starting capital for our campaign. The price is the first plane we have laid, and we have to pay half of the income to her. Among all, I get the most money. But the battle The plane is not without risk. The seven Akmonds of the year, there are only three living now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the understatement of Gotton, Richard heard unusually fierce. The seven young powers who dared to challenge the legendary Masters fell into four places in the plane war in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Gordon looked at the sky outside the window and put on a serious expression and said, "Okay, time is not too early, so don't say those." Richard, you are an adult, and you are already a regular member of the Archimonde family. As a patriarch, not your father, I will continue to give you some resources. But in return, you also need to comply. The three ancient traditions of the Archimonde family, and the need to remain loyal to the family before you fully return the family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before returning the family?" Inquire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the future, when your contribution to Archimonde has exceeded the family's investment in you, you can no longer be bound by the family. Instead, they develop according to their own wishes. Many Archimondes have embarked on this path. But before you discharge your obligations, you must obey the ancient traditions of the family. This is the responsibility of every Archimonde. Seriously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which three ancient traditions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s look became more solemn Straight to the body, Shen Sheng said: "One, to maintain the purity and continuity of the blood; Second, there is no civil war between family members; Third, the most powerful Archimonde has the obligation to guard the family cemetery."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter two are well understood, but the first point makes Richard somewhat confusing. Gordon knew that Richard actually knew little about Archimonde's traditions and secrets, so he explained it in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archimonde family inherits an ancient and mysterious blood, with strong and unstable blood, and has a blood circulation capacity of up to 22 Kind. The richer and purer the blood, the more likely it is to gain a strong bloodline and become an unbeatable powerhouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from hundreds of years ago, the Archimonde family had an old family training, that is to maintain the purity and inheritance of the blood, is each Kemond's most sacred obligation. The blood heritage needs to have offspring, and the richness and purity of the blood requires two people who also have the blood of Akmon. So every tribe who is supported by the Archimonde family needs to marry or marry an Archimonde until they complete their contribution to the family or give birth to a child. In many cases, the other half of Archimonde is appointed by the patriarch or the strong within the family, and he has no choice. The weaker the strength, the less the voice in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the history of Archimonde, there are many examples of intermarriage between relatives, and there is even a marriage between brothers and sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard understands why the meeting between the black rose castle and the brothers and sisters, the atmosphere will be so weird and strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
