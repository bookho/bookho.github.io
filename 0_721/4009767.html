			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the street has long been bloody, all the servants have been cut off the limbs The aristocratic youth who participated in the work each paid a right hand as a price. And Fogg is still hanging on Goliath's left hand. He is too pale because of blood loss. He is too weak and has no strength to scream. He can only scream a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Goliath stared at Fogg with interest, just as the brown bear saw the winter fish, and even held his hand and turned around. Said: "Joseph's boy, you are just a deserter. Joseph's old guy can actually take his own son out as abandon, it is really unexpected! You can rest assured, I will not kill you, That will bring me too much trouble, but your piece will never be used after that!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, Goliath’s left hand Shaking up violently, Fokker swayed like a puppet, and the sound of the bones cracked in his body. His pale face suddenly appeared a layer of blood red, then his eyes turned and he finally passed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlookers are discolored again, but no one speaks. Goliath shattered all of Fokker's grudge and ruined his internal organs. In the days to come, Fokker can no longer practice martial arts, and can only spend his life in weakness and illness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the other side of the woods, Senma snorted coldly, and the fine sword in his hand was lightly licked, and the blood attached to it became a string of blood. Beads, draw a beautiful symbol on the ground. And ten meters away, the snake was leaning against the big tree, one hand on the chest, one finger on the horse, all the faces were shocked. The blood continued to flow from the fingers that held the chest tightly, and the sputum of the majority of the robe was dyed in an instant. What he wants to say, but all the mouth is full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma went two steps forward and picked up a delicate blue and black handkerchief from the ground and looked at it and said, "The original It’s a refined level of alchemy, let me see what is engraved here... Hey! It’s the famous 'poison needle', you really want to pay the money, no wonder I think the threat is so big! Accepted, anyway, you don't need it in hell, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the statue of Senma, the snake reaches out and seems to want Grab her. But the feeling of weakness that followed immediately swallowed up all the consciousness and let him slip to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma walked to the edge of the forest, frowning at his waist, where a blue-black arrow was inserted, and only a little tail feather was exposed. She did not move the arrow, but instead gnawed her teeth to the corner of the street and saw that Richard could still stand on his own strength, which was relieved. Then the blood on her face suddenly faded, and the stunned momentum dissipated, and even a soft expression could be seen from her charming eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warlin also climbed up and stood beside Richard, looking at the blood, stumps and screaming people in a place, his face dead The same white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gomalia has now thrown Fokker on two Joseph servants who are still tossing and turning around, looking at Senma and laughing: "You are still so beautiful! But recently the taste has changed a bit. How do you like to insert something in such a small waist? If you don't go back to the treatment earlier, you have to go to the Eternal Dragon Hall for a few days. Of course, the temple treatment anyway. It’s Gotton’s money, it’s not related to me. It’s not bad to let him take out a blood!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma took a deep breath, looked still, strode Going to Richard, I lifted him up and then gave a gift to Goliath and Ellie, saying, "Then I will go back first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Go, the old guys in the parliament have me to deal with it." Goliath waved a big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senma did not stop, grabbed the head and walked to the temple. As long as you turn a corner, you can enter the line of sight of the temple guards. At that time, whoever dares to shoot them will incur the attack of the temple guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallin cried: "Hey! Bring me!" But Samma simply ignored him and soon disappeared into the temple with Richard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolingh screamed a few times, and had to live in a sly mouth, with a sinful color on his face. Although he is the son of Gotton, his position in the family is not high, and it is completely different from the 13 knights who follow the birth of Gotton. Although there are many children in Gordon, before the appearance of Richard, other people actually have little privilege. In contrast, Wolin’s privilege is even less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the back of Senma, Wolin suppressed his voice and said with a hateful words: "Mom, isn’t it a scorpion--? Just because of me Mom is a civilian, who dares to look down on me? One day, Laozi will kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a word is finished, Wolin suddenly realizes that there are people in the family. Two strong players. So I immediately sneaked aside and sneaked aside, and found that Goliath and Ellie were talking to themselves, and they didn’t seem to notice their self-talk, which was reassuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golly’s eyes narrowed slightly and looked at the corner of the building exposed on the hillside in the distance, saying: “There are a few mice over there, very far apart. You can smell their smell! It should be that Joseph’s Raymond is there, although I can’t feel his breath, but the other ones should be his men. The kid heard that he’s recently risen in the Joseph family. It’s very fast, I think most of this time is related to him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sneered and said, “Not half, he planned. I This is to talk to him in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good! I am not good at this kind of thing, it depends on you. Now if I pass, I will probably kill a few Personal," Goliath said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me! But for that matter, you have to help me!" Ellie said simply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deal! Richard, the little guy, I can also look very pleasing to the eye, but it may not be able to convince the Gotton guy! I can only say that I try my best." Goliath opened her mouth and smiled happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the end of the boulevard sounded like a thunderous hoof, and a group of golden helmets with red cloaks dressed in royal cloaks turned from the corner. Quickly rushed to the corner. The headed knight saw a pool of blood and debris, especially the emblems of the Archimonde and Joseph families, and the corners of the eyes involuntarily twitched. He jumped from the war and went to Goliath. He said, "I am the patrol captain Dean of the Royal Knights. How do you call it, what happened here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorea embraced his arms and said, "I am Goliath, Archimonde, Count of Goliath in the province of Weixi! As for what happened, then, look Many people here have seen the complete process from beginning to end. As for myself, I am now willing to accompany you to the parliamentary aristocracy for an explanation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Heard the name of Goliath, Dean pupil shrinks sharply, but the attitude is more respectful. He immediately turned around and let the knights of his men go to the pastor and the priest to come over. Now, apart from a few servants, there is no real dead. However, if you drag on for a while, you will have to die. At that time, the account is likely to be counted on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
