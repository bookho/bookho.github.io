			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppressing the top elves, it is equivalent to suppressing the entire eternity The night tribe, although there are still a few night elves jumped out of doubt, but when they were also directly executed by Richard by Thunder, the entire tribe was temporarily quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Richard took stock of the entire Yongye tribe’s inventory, and there were two life fruits, dozens of kilograms of elf high-grade weapons dedicated forging moonstones, dozens The leaves of youth, more than a hundred long bows of nature, and the branches of five life trees, the power of nature is made of the branches of the tree of life, the power is half the size of the human longbow. The twigs of the tree of life are still the only materials for making the staff, and the staff made with them can be epic gear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the nature of the long bow or the life of the staff, manufacturing is extremely complicated and troublesome, the entire production process of a long bow takes twenty years, and the life method It takes fifty years for the rod to reach the full power. Many of the materials of the two kinds of equipment are derived from the Everlasting Tree of Life, so it is more effective than the ordinary Greenson Tree. For example, two fruits of life can provide fifteen years. The extra life, not the decade of other fruits of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inventory of the Yongye tribe is roughly worth three top-level sacrifices. It is a great reward, but Richard will not take it away. He also wants to give the whole tribe. Entering a large amount of resources to support and develop the power of the elves, and there is still a problem in front of Richard, that is, the Yongyue Life Tree is too far away from the forward base, and there is no time for more than ten years. If you want to get through the channel between the two, and there is no channel, then under the constant suppression of the forest will, the Yongye tribe is still an island, and it will fall sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since the proverb has moved, the tribe to which the world tree belongs must not be too far away. In the forest, facing the world tree, Richard feels his head. I haven't gotten into the water yet, I can't do this stupid thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard faces a tough choice, whether to put the Everlasting Life Tree here, or to migrate, and the migration is a heavy blow to any tree of life. Especially from the never-night tree of life from Noland, it will be in a period of weakness in the decades after the migration, and it is possible to drop a grade directly, and put it here, relying on it, and then re-arranging With enough construction knights, Richard still has the confidence to withstand the offensive of the guardian elves, but the consequence of this plan is that there may be nearly 100 builder knights and two or three strong followers before the channel is opened. It’s hard to say that it’s a good choice for Richard, who has always pursued strategic initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about most of the night, Richard once again communicated with the Everlasting Life Tree and informed him of his decision: “Prepare for migration.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Tree is again in Richard In front of the image of Lin Jing, he said: "The migration will make me have a period of weakness of 30 to 40 years, but if you are willing to give me two fruits of life, then this period of weakness will be shortened to three years." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three years, let me consider it first." Richard did not immediately make a decision, the three life fruits brought by the two life fruits, to the present Li Inspecting is not very important, but it is extremely important to others. Their value is equivalent to two top sacrifices. The top sacrifices can do more, in contrast to shortening the weakness of the tree of life. The period is not that important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am in a period of weakness, the fertility rate in the tribe will be greatly affected, in addition, I can not provide additional defense measures, the field will be reduced, the tree People will fall into a deep sleep." The night of the night tree of life is a series of shortcomings of the weak period, which dissipated, but it still failed to convince Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning light lights up the forest again, the elves of the Yongye tribe begin a new day, but this day is destined to be remembered in many people’s hearts. One day, because Richard announced that the Yongye tribe will leave this land that has lived for more than 100 years and move to the base city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tree of life grows on a piece of land for ten years, this land is not just a conceptual territory, it will be contaminated with the breath of the tree of life. Rich and energetic, the elves stand on this land, do nothing, the power will grow slowly, and there will be a feeling of comfort that no other place has. All the elves are attached to the tree of life and love the homeland. Realistic basis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a choice, Richard is not willing to migrate the tree of life, but the cost of holding a large number of knights in Greenson will be even greater. However, there is not much reaction. They also know that the current power of the tribe can't resist the forest camp. But many elves still doubt the true strength of Richard. The Yongye tribe migrates to the base city and can get it. Preservation, the forest camp once moved along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question, when Richard’s costume knight appeared, he got the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first rider knight came out of the forest and appeared in the territory of the Yongye tribe, the alert elf sentry almost shot the long arrow in his hand, the reason It was the strength and murder of the knight that was too big, which made him feel extremely nervous, even frightened. With the instinct of the hunter, the elf sentinel knew at first glance that the guy who was wrapped in the heavy body at first glance It is his own natural nemesis, and he also smells a strong magical smell from the knights, which are often linked to destruction and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the sentinel remembered this time. Richard said that his knight would arrive recently. He looked at the knight in the tree and thought that if this was the general of the leader, it would be fine, but in the knight. Behind him, there were several costume knights coming out of the forest, and the breath was as strong as him. With the appearance of a rider, the Elf sentry was completely sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hundreds of costume knights appeared under the tree of life, the entire Yongyue tribe had a great commotion, and all the elves went out of their homes. Suddenly watching the knights who are neatly arranged on the edge of the green space, hundreds of knights gather together. The calm and irony momentum, the bloody and full-bodied blood, seems to reduce the temperature under the tree of life by ten degrees. This is a torrent of steel and magic that can destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is standing in the sly room at the moment, but when he sees his knight in the window, he is a glimpse. He does not perceive these structures. With the arrival of the knight, the followers along the way failed to contact him, and on the back of the holy unicorn, clearly sitting on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the soul connection between himself and the followers is suppressed by the forest will, and as soon as he thinks of it, Richard’s heart immediately floats a vague uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights began to dismount at this time, camping on the edge of the grass, and Ellie was guided by the elf warrior, striding toward the tree of life, red The short hair is like a beating flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your followers not only ignore the command of my army, but most of them have not joined me until now." This is Ellie seeing Lee. The first sentence of the inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They didn't meet you halfway." Richard asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Ellie said categorically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha understands the meaning of Ai Li’s sin, and any outstanding general can’t stand the situation where his soldiers have not listened to orders, but Richard There is not much thought. In the tradition of Noland, the strong people at the Sanctuary level can get considerable freedom of movement on the battlefield, and even decide whether to withdraw in advance according to their own judgment. In the true sense of the army, Only at the level of the knights, and Richard’s original talents are outstanding. Over the years, Richard has been born and died, and his combat experience is extremely rich, and when the talents of Richard’s builders are fully utilized, wealth It is no longer the shortcoming of Archimonde. Instead, it becomes an area that can compete with any giants. Therefore, a large number of pharmacies, equipment, and even special items from sacrifices have armed these followers to each tooth. It can be said that every follower is no longer a sanctuary in the ordinary sense. Such a person, the idea will naturally change, they are almost in the eyes except for Richard. Alizee want to make them the same as Richard obey orders, destined to run into a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
