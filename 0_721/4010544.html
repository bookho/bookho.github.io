			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you need a combat unit that can resist the will of the forest, only wait for me four When the order is high, it can be manufactured in large quantities.” The wisdom of the mother nest larvae is extremely high. When we see the environment of Green Forest, we understand what Richard needs. Then it sends a new piece of information to Richard. It is from All the resources needed for the first-order promotion to the ninth order, it can be seen that this larva does continue all the information of the ontology, and the ancestor body knows what it needs only when it is about to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this list, Richard frowned slightly. He found that the resources needed for the mother's nest were even more than the body, especially the need for divinity. Larger, considering that the parent nest can create a special unit after each fourth stage, and these special units are almost all created by divinity, then the required divinity is even bigger, the more to the back The more divinity required for some special abilities, the divine nature has become the biggest bottleneck restricting the growth of the mother nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the resources needed are doubled, the importance of the nest is still irreplaceable, so Richard immediately said, "Okay, at least when you advance to the eighth Before, I need everything I need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many resources needed for the mother's nest, but the benefits are also there. The number of combat units it can create is not the original. It is said that it is two-thirds of the ontology, but only one less than the ontology, so that in addition to the highest-order arms, there are not many differences with the ontology in other aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last parent nest larva confirmed to Richard the scope of his activities, and Richard thought about it, thinking that this place is good, so the mother nest larvae Around the area, the twilight will remain, while the splashes and tiramisu take turns to protect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrangement was completed, and Richard passed the natural enemies of the tree of life to the mother nest larvae. During the eating and growing process, the mother larvae can slowly digest these. Information, and will develop targeted combat arms, in this regard, the mother nest is an expert, the last bird robber can be said to play a vital role in the life tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the mother's nest stopped eating, quietly squatted for a while, then discharged a whole eight milky white eggs, and the follicles hatched after half an hour. There are eight worker bees, but the prototypes created by these worker bees and the body are much smaller than each other. Each one is only half a meter away. The worker bees on the mother nest are now bigger and bigger, and the number is over three. Meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eight small worker bees were born, they rushed to the nearest big tree and began to forage. In just a few minutes, they ate their stomachs and then began to grow. They also had a terrifying growth rate. It took only a few hours for the sputum to break out, and the head grew to nearly one meter, and then began to eat again. After this time, they would convert what they ate into energy-rich honey, and then feed. To the mother's nest, the mother's nest is also trying to eat, grow, and not stop for a moment, only one day to grow up a meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is always with the mother's nest, watching its growth and eating process. The next day, the mother's nest has created eight small worker bees. Therefore, its growth rate is faster, the mother nest is eaten all the time, the things that can be eaten are limited, and the honey liquid produced by the worker bees can significantly increase the speed of the body growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight then knocked on the nest of the nest, and then poked out a pink finger, actually poked on the insect A deep hole came out, and the twilight shook his head and said, "Your insect is too weak, and a five-level guy can kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The mother's nest replied: "I don't need insects, I just need to grow fast, defenders, don't forget your name, and protect my safety is your number one priority."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight smiled and said: "Wrong, protecting Richard is my most important thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest After a moment of silence, even after eating for a while, I said, "I remember that the order given to you by the body is not like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luo, if Richard has something wrong, the body will not live for a long time, at least for now." The twilight seems very relaxed, and does not take the order of the mother's nest body seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has been thinking for a while, the whole turn over, staring at the twilight with more than ten eyes, slowly said: "Your soul has Very complete, independence is so strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight is not shrinking and looking at the nest, saying: "Your soul is no longer It’s a simple simulation of divinity. I have observed you for a day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has turned and went to eat, ovulate, calmly said: “According to the environment, it is the most basic ability of each nest. I just did what I need to do most.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight smiled again and said, "Is that true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest replied: "Then you said."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God knows." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest does not care for her, but continues to eat, but the twilight does not intend to give up, continue to follow the nest, and poke a few on it. A small hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The defender, you have wasted one-tenth of the energy of a worker bee. In the long run, this energy is quite significant." The mother's nest is cold and cold. Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't call the defender, my name is twilight." The twilight emphasizes, while continuing to poke the hole in the nest, saying: " You see, I am not afraid to tell the fact that my soul is already independent. What are you afraid of? Do you want to betray the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is cold Authentic: "The few people around the master can all want to kill you, I mean, your loyalty, they will not see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;绯色The beautiful little face hidden in the shadow suddenly dimmed, and then said nothing: "That is my business, you do not need to control, it is you, the current state is not afraid to be discovered by the body."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is silent for a while, only a long time later said: "Defender, no, twilight, what do you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The twilight eyes immediately lit up and said, "I want the secret of your soul independence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible." Refused, "Because I don't know why this is happening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, you don't know now, you will always know, because you are good at analyzing by nature. The power of the soul level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest has quietly created a new batch of worker bees, and then said: "Then I can get anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight smiled and said: "The time of growth, and, without prejudice to my protection of the master, I will protect you, you see You are soft like a bread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother's nest said coldly and coldly: "I am trying to grow at the fastest speed. Now under the protection of the owner, there is nothing that can threaten me. I don't need to waste resources on insects or other attacking ability. On the other hand, in the twilight, you have poked off half of the worker bees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight smiles and pokes a few small holes in succession. Satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Richard received the news that the mother’s nest was promoted to the second order. Like the ontology, the parent’s nest also gave his details when he was promoted. Passed over, the mother's nest has the opportunity to strengthen their abilities when they are promoted. The mother's nest is divided into two opportunities for increasing the number of combat units. For the mother's nest, this is a moderate choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the mother’s nest gave birth to twelve eggs in one breath, and the twilight glanced at the forest. There were already dozens of worker bees busy, from time to time. The worker bees fly back to the nest and feed the honey to the mother's nest. All the workers created by the mother's nest in the past few days are all worker bees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seven days, Richard received the third-order information of the parent's nest, and this time the mother's nest chose a power that made Richard feel strange. Worker bees multiply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability allows the female nest to create worker bees, which are produced by the double-nuclear breeding eggs, from which two worker bees can be produced in each egg, invisible, worker bees The number of creations is doubled. The problem is that the mother nest needs so many workers to do. In Richard’s memory, when the body was promoted to the third order, there are quite a few good abilities to choose from, and Richard also I feel a little strange, because the mother's nest did not let Richard choose the ability for him when he was in the promotion stage. Instead, he made a decision directly, but Richard turned to think that he gave the information of the natural enemy of the tree to the mother's nest. In the Greenson plane, it can be said that in the future, this is the main enemy. The mother nest is estimated to have an evolutionary path for this purpose. In this way, Richard does not feel anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest, when the mother nest and the large number of worker bees have created a small open space, it produces fourteen eggs, and Two worker bees climbed out of each egg, and the twilight was greatly surprised. "Why worker bees breed, why do you choose this ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother After a long time in the nest, I replied faintly: "This plane is vast, with endless food and energy, and no more worker bees."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
