There has never been a similar situation in other superpowers. Even if it is uncertain, Richard can roughly perceive her power. Level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martins indulged and said, "I think this may be related to the condition of the heavens. You also know that the Glorious Lord is closely related to the heavens, and may even be a certain The people of heaven are born in Noland. But now the situation in heaven is very chaotic, the news is messy, and no one knows what happened there. Now the passages to the heavens are closed, even if it is Micah. The original heavenly people of Le could not go back. The Glorious Lord God has not responded to our prayers and calls for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop for a while, Martin continued: "There must have been something that we can't understand on the pope. I now suspect that he may be associated with some mysterious forces. I need some time to figure this out. Before I figure out his cards, I It is not recommended that you challenge him now. I said last time that he is trying to become a god himself, so it is also possible that when we challenge him, I will find myself fighting a god who walks in the world. To say that you and I are now the strength is not enough "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This is what, Richard also turned serious and heavy, nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most dangerous time of the Lord God is not to raise the gods, but to ignite the fire, but has not yet established between the kingdoms of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period, he is between the main plane and the void, can walk freely in the main plane, but the power of the power is after the rise of the kingdom of God Not far from each other. The main god of the subliminal power is equivalent to a powerful legend, and like the glory of this level, the combat power can rival the super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Pope has already ignited the fire, but can make Richard and St. Martin not see, then Richard may hit a super strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this period is very short, and the gods without the kingdom of God will be squeezed out by the rules of the plane. So, as St. Martin said, time is on their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the heart of the big lord in Richard's body slowly pulsed. The energy it plucked was all over Richard's body, but Richard's body couldn't bear so much power, so a circle of invisible waves scatter in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin saw the energy abnormality of Richard’s body and asked: “Is there still no way to control it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Richard nodded and said calmly: "The power gap is still too big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin said with envy: "This is what you can The reason for superimposing a Midrande battle version on everything else is gray? Your carrying capacity is simply unlimited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha smiles, Say: "My luck is good. But it may not be comparable to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin said: "I have been working hard, you are the same. Otherwise It’s just that the opportunity can’t be grasped. In fact, you dared to approach the heart of the big lord, and the courage is really big enough. According to the truth, how can you just suppress it with your legendary strength? Under normal circumstances Either it is directly smashed by the power it emits, or it is controlled by it, and it becomes the shackles of the abyss of the abyss. Ghost!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the hateful tone of Martin’s speech, Richard was helpless and said with a smile: "We are still standing still. The same camp?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin’s face looks stunned: “Yes! There’s not a pope that’s old things, it’s not a guilty time. People like you, if you have the chance to kill it, you must not miss it. The world is big and small. Heroes have one for me, no need for a second!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know what to say, and he coughed a few times and said, "So, should I stand on the side of the pope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin's face suddenly changed, and hurriedly said: "Don't be! You are so big with his enemies, that he would not accept you if he wants to turn it down."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha white gave him a look and said: "There is no hatred of him and you." Well, no kidding, what is the situation on your side?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin said: "It's not bad. It is very calm with the Pope. Everything has never happened. All decisions are voted at the Cardinal Conference. The meeting is actually me and him now. So anything. It’s all about negotiation. In addition, the old guy in Chinese has already returned. His current attitude is very subtle. It seems to have been shaken. I feel that if I work harder, I can win him.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, are you not the big picture?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marst nodded: "Really. If Chinese Ken will definitely be able to contain the Pope. This old guy has a lot of cards and will not be much worse than the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said: “The relationship between us will be different by then?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s face is of course: “That’s of course! Putting the old in the church Guy, after I became a pope, the first thing was to start the dynasty and the church army. Your black rose castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee face sè suddenly blackened, although I have known for so long, but so staggered thinking and so direct to St. Martin The attitude is still very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed a few times and said, "You really... what do you say? I really don't know what to say. But you Just dare to fight over? The Glorious Lord God has gone out of the situation. The strength of the superpowers on your side has all fallen sharply. The most important thing about this emptiness state is to keep the old nest and dare to come to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martinus shook his head and said: "You are too underestimating yourself. For me, you are an enemy that is more dangerous than anyone! Destroying you is the first big thing. It’s not that I don’t want to kill the old guy of the Pope. I can’t move too much power. I’ve been leading the Black Rose Castle myself.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A long sigh of relief, finally revealing some hidden shackles: "If you dare to come, I will let you all over the army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin Looking at Richard deeply, I suddenly showed a sunny smile: "I really didn't read it wrong! In that battle, you didn't have all the cards at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With you next to me, how can I arbitrarily play cards?" Richard sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Martin suddenly shrugged and put on a harmless smile. He said, "Before I kill the pope, we will not be able to fight for a while. Or let me say another thing, I have a friend, her origins are somewhat ......Special. Let me just say, she is from heaven, and now she can’t go back. She needs some equipment and equipment. I just heard that you have opened up a new battlefield for the abyss and let her Also register to participate! Remember to take care of me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei was completely speechless, and said slowly after a while: "You think I will help you always remember "People who flatten my nest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin smiled and raised a booklet in his hand and said, "You can't refuse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha doubles and asks: "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin laughs It’s brilliant: “The darkness of the travels, written by a oracle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How can you have this in your hand?” Richard’s gaze suddenly He was extremely sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin’s innocent expression: “Unintentionally turned out from the secret database of the church. You also know that our church has existed for so long, each There will be a lot of unpredictable things thrown in the year. So you have to ask me about its origins, and I can only say that I don’t know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then how do you know that I want this thing?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess." St. Martin's sunny smile reveals a little rogue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and said, "If you know so much, why have you just killed me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin also sighed reluctantly and said, "I think, but I can't do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He made a slap in the face, and added a sad expression. "For example, the old things in Chinese, I can tell the details of his bottom, even when he was a child, he stole the ass of several little girls. But then that What's the use? I still can't beat him. You just said, I really want to come and destroy you, you must let me go all over. So!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Richard did not relax and asked: "You just said that you don't know the Chinese card..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be free to talk about it, don't take it seriously Ah! So, this thing, want it, want it?” St. Martin smiled and waved the booklet in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a feeling of being ridiculed, Richard still grits his teeth and says: "Get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Then my woman..." Martin smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha said categorically: "As long as I don't die, she won't have anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Complete! Dealing with you is a pleasure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the image disappeared, St. Martin seemed to think of something again, hurriedly said: "Church secret library There are still a lot of things in it, maybe I will find something, so let's work together! When I clean up the old things of the Pope, I will come and hit you, you can rest assured!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When St. Martin’s image disappeared, the last wave of the communication magic array sent him a mutter: “Do I know too much?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication magic array is finally quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Richard did not look in the mirror, he knew that his face must be black as never before. At the headquarters of the church, St. Martin stood in front of the communications law, with a smile on his face, but apparently fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An illusory light and shadow emerged behind him, she hesitated and screamed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Martin returned from his meditation and saw that the girl with four light wings immediately said with some heartache: "How come you come out again?" "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I am worried about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It should be that I am worried that you are right! You appear like this, and the burden on the body is very heavy. But you don’t have to worry now, I have already found all the materials. After the ceremony, you can have the world in this world. Walking the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
