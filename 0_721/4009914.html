			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolfs are getting bigger, and from time to time there will be a small group of new gangsters joining In the course of hunting, this is already a wolf group with a scale of more than 4,000. If the new one is a horse, then it is mobile and has a large number of people. If it is a slave group, although the number is not much, it is the individual combat strength. All in all, being able to survive in the blood of the land has its own uniqueness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a lot of murder in the quiet night, but the sleeping people are sleeping, and after the battle between life and death, they all choose trust partners. And sufficient physical strength is the guarantee for living tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold of the night made Richard subconsciously wrap the blanket. His eyebrows are wrinkled and he seems to be doing something bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indeed dreaming. For a magician with considerable meditation, dreaming is hard to come by. At this moment, he entered the dream. In the dream, Li is riding in the battle, staring at the vast mountains and rivers ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the territory of the Schumpeter family, and the other side is the Joseph family territory. From afar, you can see that the people on the two fields are running back and forth. It is very busy. They continue to withdraw from the city, gather together into a stream of people, and flee to the distance. Knights with small stocks everywhere constantly rushed out of the villages, towns and cities, gathered into a team, and finally merged into a torrent of water, in front of Richard. The knights in the village seem to be inexhaustible, and there will be a few more in a while, and they don’t know where they came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that if he waited, the other knights would only get more and more. So he raised his hand and pointed out the attack command in the consciousness. After the two teams of knights had the arm fingers, they quickly left the queue and ran out from the two wings. They circled a great arc and fled to escape. The way back to the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Richard continued to follow the instructions in the consciousness, so each two teams of knights rushed to the two wings of the opposing knights, and then Lee was behind him. The infantry began to move forward, compressing the opponent's charge space. The archer has already opened the bow, and then a dense arrow of rain fell to the opponent's cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How clearly is the distance between the arrows, how does this arrow rain hit the opponent's battle? It is Oral who does not have this ability now. Only the big shooter with the Elf and the fifteenth level can shoot a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back in disbelief, only to find that in the high ground behind the battlefield, standing is a row of tall elves Shooter. These elves are about a third larger than the average elf. It is said that after some elf warriors reach the realm of the big shooter, the body shape will become larger, which will greatly increase the strength of the arm. These characteristics are very similar to the devil, distinguishing the power of the devil, just look at the size of the block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some of Richard did not understand, when did he have more than a thousand elf shooters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his consciousness was immediately connected to the team's elf shooter, just like the connection with the mother's nest. So Richard immediately set the target focus for the elf shooters, and the goals of the thousand shooters were all concentrated in a small area of ​​the left wing. Then a new wave of arrows flew over the head of Licha, drifting over the kilometer, and falling intensively, and instantly turned that area into a complete dead land. Hundreds of knights fell directly, so there was a sudden blank in the horizontal array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Richard saw that the arrows flying in the air were far more than a thousand branches, and looked back. It was discovered that each of the elf shooters had three arrows on the longbow and then shot them once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is innocent for the skill of the elf shooter, because the consciousness has been connected to the cavalry of the left-wing assault, mobilizing their direction, facing the horizontal array that was only shot The notch is cut into it. Only after the order was finished, Richard discovered that the horses of the knights did not know when they became tall earth dragons. He looked at the heavy infantry who was pressing forward slowly. Sure enough, they expanded one point each time they walked forward. When they arrived at the distance of the short soldiers, they also turned from human beings into tall, devils. And the dragon came from the sky, and a giant dragon appeared out of thin air, waiting for Richard's order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite, all the fugitive civilians of the Joseph and Schumpeter family suddenly turned into powerful knights, rushing past the troops. Richard was shocked and immediately ordered to adjust his formation and assigned a reinforcement to go. However, the two sides have been violently hedged together, and the strange scene has appeared. The other knights will be turned into civilians as long as they are cut down, and they will fall into a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha has no time to take care of these civilians, consciousness is running at full speed, and several orders are issued every second, but there are hundreds of totals in the party and the other party. The team, on the battlefield where more than 100,000 people are killing each other, he still cares for him. Richard felt that his head was sore that it would explode the next moment, but he could only hold his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the fiercest battle, the sky in the battlefield suddenly became dark, the colors of the whole world have been lost, and all turned into a black and white world. All the fighters stopped moving, then became blurred, turned into shadows, and finally twisted into countless shadow creatures, and swooped over to Richard! For a time, in Richard's field of vision, only the overlapping claws and fangs were left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng’s a moment, Richard suddenly sat up, only to find that he was just dreaming. However, this dream made him exhausted, just as he really commanded the army to fight for a few hours of endless war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold wind blew, the bitter cold made Licha chill, then he found out that he was sweating in his sleep, clothes They are soaked, and then blown by the night wind, naturally uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a few deep breaths to make his heart beat a little. However, at this moment, he suddenly felt the ground had a slight undetectable vibration. He immediately fell to the ground, his ears only stuck to the gravel, and the whole force was extended, so he found that the ground was shaking and growing stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha was completely awake, and a fish jumped from the ground and shouted: "The enemy attack! All!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf poet at the top of Shifeng also called up at this time: "Northeast direction! Five hundred people around the team... strong, at least ten people! One kilometer away! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One kilometer away, it is only a minute or so under the horse's hoof. The warriors who were lying down and turned up immediately, their weapons were at hand and they could grab them when they reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chaos of the camp, the elf poets at the top of the pinnacle have shot three arrows in succession. The long arrow flew more than 500 meters under the influence of magical power, and the three cavalry rushing in the forefront were dismissed. But among the cavalry that hundreds of rides rolled, the three cavalry that fell were like a small splash in the rapids, and disappeared in a blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving winds leaped onto the rocks, and the cavalry rushed to the front of the cavalry, and six or seven cavalry screamed. They were immediately trampled by the followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
