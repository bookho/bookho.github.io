			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calendar turns over the first day of April, and Richard takes his own number Not much luggage, leaving the dark blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring is not so cold, the wind is a little cool, blowing on the body is soft and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the east to the place bordering the Imperial Highway, the Hengdong Mountain spur line turns northward here, and the wide four-carriage parallel road follows The extension of the mountains continues northward, and one end leads to the depths of the empire. It is also a place to say goodbye to the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li Chaul stopped the war horse and looked back. At the end of the line of sight, the spectacular outbuildings of Deep Blue are hidden in the mist, and only the magnificent spires are looming over the clouds. Far from the smog in the distance is the ice floes, and the clouds that stand through the clouds are the overlapping snow peaks of the Hengdong Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep blue is not only his five years of life, but also countless precious memories, and more than 20 million debts. In the last two years, Richard successfully earned more than six million gold coins by selling the magic grain to Black Gold, and repaid part of the 'debt'. He regards all the ‘Su Helun’s joy’ as debt, and these futures must be returned to the legendary mage. Although the Grey Dwarf does not understand Richard's insistence, he welcomes his practice. In particular, Richard never cares about the huge difference between the Grey Dwarf and the acquisition and sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the future, even if one day, Richard repaid all the 'debt', the total value of more than 30 million 'joy' will always be his heart. The most valuable wealth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, it's time to go." Modred's voice came from the front and interrupted the thousands of emotions in Richard's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha sighed in his heart, which prompted the horse to catch up with Mordred. Modred’s gaze fell on Richard’s war and nodded. He said with approval: “The horse is good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iron horse of the specialty of the ice floes in the bay area belongs to the dark blue domesticated breed of more than three generations. The strong attributes of Warcraft itself are still preserved, but the temper is not as violent as the wild iron horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse is obviously much taller than the ordinary iron armor, just a little smaller than Modred’s mount. But before the ride of Modred, the horse of Richard was obviously uneasy, but under the control of Richard, he could barely keep side by side. In the eyes of Modred, anyone who can approach his lava is able to count as a good horse without falling to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike ordinary horses, ‘lava’ is carnivorous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battles of countless times of life and death, the lava is the first to hit or even kill the opponent who killed the opponent directly. Reid took the opportunity to take the upper hand and kill the opponent in one fell swoop. Therefore, there are absolutely a lot of powerful Warcraft under the hooves of the lava. Therefore, like Modred, ‘lava’ is always full of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armored horse can walk alongside the lava, and Richard sat quietly on the horse, seemingly feeling nothing about the blood of Modred. Now Richard is completely a young man, and his body has grown. His appearance has a three-point shadow, but he is more handsome and handsome. Only the expression that always smiles faintly, but makes people unable to see the inner world, does not belong to any of Elannie and Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modred looked at Richard's well-defined side face and smiled with satisfaction. Being able to stay with him if nothing happens, it means that Richard will not be exposed in the bloody battlefield everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of learning from Naa, Richard watched him more than once, and the whole process was more bloody than the bloody parrot. By the third time, Richard no longer needed wooden barrels. On the fifth time, he began to help Naja to fight. After the eighth time, there was still room for cleaning the entire kitchen. The blood of Modred's body, Richard barely noticed that Naa's kitchen tastes more than this. It’s just that the endless murderousness hidden in the blood of Modred is that Naja can’t be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first went to Rutherland Village to pick up Richard and Elani, Modred took a squadron of heavy-loaded knights and two light cavalry. And five years later, when Deep Blue picked up Richard, Modred only took two knights to accompany him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are equipped with knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two second-order knights. Their combined fighting power is slightly worse than that of Modred, who had been to Rutherland Village. It took some time to kill two brigades, that is, two hundred riders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is a one-person ride, and there is a horse with a lot of luggage. Four people and five riders, slowly drifting on the vast land between the mountains and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are many ways to travel long distances on the mainland of Noland. If you have enough ability to pay, then the two-legged dragon and gryphon that are domesticated on a fixed-line manned flight are good choices, and the larger Moslan double-headed eagle is known for its long-term endurance. Fly out three thousand kilometers. The well-known floating boat of the gnomes is also a miracle created by alchemy technology. The installation facilities in the aircraft are very comfortable, but the risk index is as high as other products of alchemy, and it is several times higher than the animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to withstand the wind pressure, cold and weightlessness in the sky, then the waterway is also a good choice, the magic-driven ocean-going ship can also drive every day. Thousands of kilometers, or domesticated scented whales, have similar trips, although the latter may be bumpy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current strength of the Archimonde family, even Richard’s thousands of gold coins with him can hire a sufficient number of griffins. They flew a few rounds between Deep Blue and Faust. Only by leaving the dark blue, the gold coin is really like a gold coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a journey that could be completed in a week by the Griffin, and Modred was ready to ride back with Richard. There are a lot of dangers along the way, and it will take a month or so. For Richard, the time of a month is invaluable and cannot be measured by gold coins. Now he is very skilled in making the initial stage of construction. Even if he is doing the most basic and agile production exercises in the heavy lifting of his studies, he can make two finished products in one month. After deducting the material cost, he will account for more than 100,000. Gold coins are not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Richard made an objection to Modred at the beginning, but Modred said it was Gordon’s decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From dark blue to fascin, the straight line distance is more than 7,000 kilometers, and the terrain can be calculated by riding the terrain, the whole journey is more than 15,000 kilometers, the road On the way, there will be large unmanned areas such as mountains, forests, and large rivers. It is full of all kinds of dangers, and it has to pass more than ten family territories that have strong hostility towards Archimonde. It is foreseeable that fighting along the way is essential. Gordon knew that Richard had chosen the magic road, so he hoped that Richard would hone his combat experience through constant battles on this road, and learn and construct the tactics of the melee reloading units such as the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
