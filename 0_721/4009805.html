			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning a small piece of soul from Richard, the life inside the seed The larva actually established a spiritual connection with Richard, just like a water flower. And it still has no shells, but it is already calling for blood from Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its call is very weak, it seems that the next moment will disappear completely, but the thirst for blood is very clear. Richard stunned and didn't respond. Suddenly he felt warm on his face and stretched his hand and found that his palm was full of blood. At this time, Richard only felt that his mouth was full of bloody smell. It should be caused by the vibration of the internal organs when he resisted the tearing of the soul. As for the blood on the face, it flows out from the nose and the corners of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood..." The seed is still calling. That is not a known language. To be more precise, it is a wave of consciousness that strongly impacts the soul of Richard and reflects this meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood on Richard's handle is applied to the cyan eggshell of the seed. Surprisingly, the eggshell that had no pores and slits suddenly seemed to have a lot of gaps, and all the blood was swallowed up in an instant. In Richard's consciousness, he felt that the life inside the seed began to grow rapidly, constantly changing, and the life atmosphere became more and more powerful. Later, even the power was so strong that Richard had some trepidation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seed does not require any more blood. All it needs is that the blood of Richard is like a fire, and this blood completely ignites its life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kacha whispered, a visible crack appeared on the surface of the eggshell, and then more and more cracks, when a sharp black blade suddenly extended That means the seeds are already sprouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eggshell around the blade begins to crack and break, and then the whole piece falls off, and a dark black insect-like creature climbs out from it. It has six pitch feet, an unusually large abdomen, and two sharp blades near the head. The whole shape is even a bit funny, like a few blades on a round ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breaking the shell, it immediately pounces on the broken eggshell, and the eggshell is eaten clean in a blink of an eye, even a little There are no fragments left, it is not as clean as it was eaten, but it seems like the whole ground has been sucked up. But wherever it passes, the blood of Richard's dripping disappears, and I don't know how it was absorbed by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It forced the body up, suddenly the whole body began to shake quickly, and after a while, the mucus on the surface of the body was sucked into the body at a speed visible to the naked eye, originally soft The carapace gradually hardens and begins to shine with a layer of sparkling luster. During this process, the body also has a significant expansion. After cleaning the eggshell fragments on the ground, its small upper body struggled to lift up, and six pairs of eyes on the head looked at Richard, and the complicated mouthparts began to move quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sea of ​​consciousness, Richard knows that a large number of fast, noisy, and unclear syllables are heard, and this is repeated several times before a clear and yet Weird voice. This is the voice of a new life. It was just looking for a way to communicate with Richard, but now it has finally been found, it is actually the Norland lingua franca, and it is no longer a shock mapping of the violent soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Needs...high energy...food." It seems to be difficult to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the seed?" Richard tempted to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seed...is...we travel...sleep form." Still can't be a sentence, jumping out of a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You? Who are you?" asked Li. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was passed through a noisy noise, and it was hard to re-clarify: "We...I don't know. I don't know." What are we, my memory is only... when I wake up. In front, the front is blank... I...the mother's nest, my existence is to destroy the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So who is your enemy?" Richard warned. When a small life is born, it exudes another breath of trepidation, and its enemies are definitely more difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your enemy is my enemy, master." This time its answer was extremely smooth and clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you call me the owner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you activated me, only me The scheduled...the main talent can activate me. I will obey the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha squatted down and watched this life like a strange insect After sinking a bit, ask: "The mother's nest, what is your food?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood, meat.....all life...energy crystal... "It replied hard, but the current language ability is obviously difficult to enumerate all the content, so it changed the way: "I am currently in the first stage of my childhood, I can... feed myself. I also need to learn the master." Language, it takes a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is somewhat speechless, even with the help of language magic, the big mentors want to master one completely The language also takes about half a month. If you just understand it and understand it, it will take about three days. And this little newborn thing only takes a day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to get you some food. There are some food reserves in the base. You are just born and will be in danger outside," Richard said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I feel, here...no my natural enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So In front of Richard, it opened the back of the carapace, revealing a small wing, and vigorously fanned it. In the snoring, its body rose straight up, and it was flush with Richard’s line of sight, then clumsily and slowly deep into the forest. Fly away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly saw a glimpse of his talent, and he discovered that the newborn’s nest was nearly half as big as when he was born. The growth of the body shape is just the volume of the eggshell it swallows. It seems a bit scary to have such a near-lossless way of absorbing food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the newborn little nest, there is always some fear in the subconscious. This is a creature that he has never heard of, and has not been recorded in any magical book. It is now shaped like a carapace, the smooth and lustrous luster is actually very beautiful, but I don't know why, it always gives a chill from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Richard’s memory, many creatures are much different in shape than the nest, such as the sucking demon in the underground world of Noland. Elf, the Roto in the depths of the ocean, etc. But how can these ethnic forms be horrible, how amazing and destructive they are, and always find a lot of information. Known power is not terrible, only the unknown is daunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
