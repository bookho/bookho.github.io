			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine has a moment of feeling in his heart, as a wolf One of the Duke's confidants, he also knows that the origin of Richard is very problematic, and is said to be inextricably linked with the ectopic face. However, for some reason, the Duke had initially decided to cooperate with Richard, so he also regarded Richard as an ally of his own side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight’s change here, Baron Fontaine has no doubt that he is targeting himself from the beginning, otherwise he will not have to call him at all. It is. Of course, when receiving Richard into the castle, Baron Fontain was not a little prepared. Only in the subsequent contacts, the Baron did have an appreciation for Richard. The young mage was brilliant and graceful. If he didn’t know some insider, he could not see the traces of his outsiders, and believed that the fabrication The identity of an ancient family descendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the news of Richard’s confession still shocked Baron Fontaine, and what Schenkel’s actions have been spread in the human kingdom at a speed of flying. Although the rumors are more exaggerated at the end, the listeners have reached a consensus that there is no possibility of any compromise or compromise with this woman who is no different from the devil. She is completely mad, perverted and murderous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting the arrival of the Guard Captain in just a few minutes seems to be extraordinarily long. "We...maybe leave?" Fontaine tried to make a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s too late." Richard shook his head heavily and said, "We simply can’t run her and her knight, once they leave. The castle, no danger, only death is faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Fontaine is also a decision-maker, and immediately decided to stay ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Richard expressed his willingness to stay, it is also a small boost. Richard himself is a ten-level magician, and his followers are not weak. Such a battle will be left to help the baron resist Sinclair, which will undoubtedly increase the confidence of the baron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is only a little increase. The baron does not think that he can resist Sinclair. She is a coalition of the temple, the nobility and the iron triangle empire. The only hope of the baron was to keep the castle and wait for the arrival of the Duke reinforcements. But this hope is also very embarrassing, because the Duke reinforcements will have to arrive in three days at the earliest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain is coming soon. Baron Fontaine issued a series of instructions. First, he ordered the standing army stationed outside the castle to prepare, and then ordered several light rides every ten minutes to go to the direction reconnaissance given by Richard. In addition, four fast horses and two messengers are ready to go to the Duke for help. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he also asked about the number, capacity, and composition of the troops that Richard brought, and assigned the location where His troops were stationed, and everything was in order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron finally sent a notice to the wife and the child to get up, but did not rush to sound the alarm of full mobilization, but waited for the news of sending out the detective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial shock, Baron Fontain completely recovered his calmness. Although he completely believed in the news of Richard, he would not make the whole castle feel uncomfortable with only a few words, and Richard did not worry, he accompanied the baron to drink tea in the study and wait for news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there was a strong wave from the mother's nest. In Richard's consciousness, the mother's nest is no longer a vague light. After thoroughly swallowing the statues of the four orc ancestors sent by Richard, the divine power absorbed has become a shining star. At this critical moment, the mother's nest was promoted, and it finally digested all the acquired divinity and successfully advanced to the third order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
