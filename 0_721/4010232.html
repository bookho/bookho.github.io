			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine sounds, a total of nine sounds! This is the most urgent signal, and it needs the army to assemble in the shortest time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the barracks and the castle are boiling, and the soldiers and generals, no matter where they are or where they are, are the first to pounce on themselves. Armed with equipment, armed with the shortest speed, and then with the supply of horses, rushed to the military camp playground below the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the castle gate opened wide, and a flaming and light gold armored Alice 婕 马 马 came out of the castle, followed by her All important generals in the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Ellie arrived at the playground, and it was only twenty minutes from her alarm. But the playground is full of heavily armed fighters. In addition to the heavy cavalry and the knights who need time to wear armor, the warriors who have arrived are neatly arranged in a square. In five minutes, all the knights and heavy cavalry will be assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice took out his sword and waved in the air for a week and said: "The warriors, the time of war is coming again, our enemies will taste the failure again. Now, the first, second and fourth battalions and the knights of the knights will follow me, and the third and fifth battalions will stay. The third battalion defends the castle, the fifth battalion guards the city and patrols. Now, let me go!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s long sword pointed to the side, and the team’s soldiers marched in unison to the road outside the city. Just look at the strictness of the military capacity, you know that this is a long-awaited iron army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by heart, this army’s equipment can only be said to be middle and lower in the mainland giants, especially the equipment of the Cavaliers’ team is obviously messy. First, a look at a lot of equipment is seized from the enemy. Now, the variegated equipment has become one of Archimonde's characteristics. The more it expands rapidly, the more the troops will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army came out suddenly and without warning. Some of the soldiers even dropped the rice bowl and ran to the playground to gather. I didn't expect it to be opened immediately. However, the soldiers are still very morale, without any doubts and embarrassment. In the past, Ellie led them to countless victories, so they believe that this trip must also be a big win. Although it is strange to suddenly send troops at dinner time, Ellie’s arrogance is unpredictable. It is possible to fight at any time. It is a trivial matter to stay up late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are warlike, and the generals are not necessarily. They think about it and can't think of anything that needs war to solve recently. Ellie has just played a few big fights in the past few days and has got everything she wants. Now that the surrounding situation is calm, who needs to fight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the city, a bearded general who was deeply trusted by Alize was approaching Alize and asked: "The Earl, we are going this time. Who are you going to fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know! Wait until the territory of the Holy Tree Dynasty!" Ellie's answer made the bearded general on the spot. Doing a great army, but no goal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words are exported, Alice knows what is wrong. She can only make mistakes and mistakes, and she will not lead a word. The generals exchanged their eyes, but their faces were dignified. There are only two situations in which the target must be kept secret before the war. It is not that there is a traitor in the army, or that the enemy is extremely powerful and will win with the squad. In either case, it means The next march will be very hard, and it will be a surprise attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generals began to prepare cautiously, but did not find the way Aliy was burying their heads. It seemed to be marching, and it was simply fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night, gradually shrouded this far-off army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few crisp lions humming in the night sky, and the whistle of the direction is also sounded below. The four lion cubs circled and landed on the lion's trowel that did not extinguish the mountain castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha and Faschi jumped from the gryphon, and Richard took a slightly stiff body and gave the griffon and luggage to him. The waiter then glanced around and nodded. "A very magnificent castle, and the design is subtle. What is even more rare is that the cost is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The left-behind general who came to meet in the castle heard the evaluation of Richard, and naturally he was very happy. I was so acclaimed by the Royal Architect that there was light on the face of the Earl. However, Faschi, who also participated in the Royal Auction, felt very weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akmund's expansion is too fast, and it is a new rising giant. There has not been much accumulation in the past. Therefore, everywhere, savings are necessary, and gradually become a common phenomenon in every Archimonde, and even become an instinct flowing in the blood. In particular, there are only a few branches of independence, such as Ellie, such as Gordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard is an alternative! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has his own private arming on the right track, a strong group of followers and elite warriors in formation, the cornerstone and core of a strong army. And he is increasingly showing a strong talent for construction, making gold coins come rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi’s days on the floating island, even if you don’t deliberately inquire, you can see a steady stream of equipment and materials being moved into the warehouse, and then Shipping out, that is a huge stream of gold coins. Richard earns faster and spends more time, and gold coins will turn into various materials and equipment that can increase combat effectiveness. It can be said that Richard now has no concept of saving. On the contrary, the luxury of his troops and the richness of supplies are almost at the top level of the giants. Looking at the entire Holy Alliance, there is not much to compare with his military equipment. And Richard has no signs of convergence at all. The royal builder seems to have set the path to rely on equipment and supplies to pile up opponents. Such a person, know what is called saving? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at this moment, saving the word into the head of Faschi, almost made her body hair erect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General Richard and the general said after seeing each other: "I am Richard, and I have an appointment with Earl of Alice to meet you tonight. Now the Earl is convenient. Let me go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect the General’s general to have a hard time, saying: “This is very unfortunate because of the urgent military situation, the Earl just I have already taken the army with him. So you can't see the countess at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Emergency military situation?" Richard's face suddenly became wonderful, but he Immediately restored calm, asked: "Where is the military situation, so that the Earl adults are so anxious, need to march overnight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Earl did not tell me, I still It’s not enough to know the level of such a high-level military secret.” The general looked awkward. If he knew that the generals who followed Ellie had not known the destination, the estimated fears would be even deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled and asked: "Do you have more soldiers in the Earl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many! Elite infantry, heavy cavalry, and knights Going out, leaving only two infantry battalions totaling 6,000 people, defending the city and the castle." General General finished, added another sentence: "It seems that the battle is really fierce, or else the Earl will not put all the decorations The knights took them away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds really serious." Richard said faintly, there was something in the voice. Then he asked again: "How many knights do the Countess now have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General swearing a few words, it is very embarrassing. At this time, Faschi said: "It doesn't matter, Richard is not an outsider, he can tell him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General General looks loose, said: "Now The Earl of the Lord has a total of 30 knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said, "Thirty, that's really a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Richard pointed to the four exhausted lions and said, "Please find someone to take care of them. In addition, if the castle has spare. If you are a gryphon, give me four. I will leave early tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you going so fast? It’s hard to come here, how Let's take a look around. The scenery that doesn't extinguish the mountain is famous in the surrounding area!" General General looked strange and then diligently retained. The next Fasqi sneaked a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha floated a charming smile and said: "Good advice, but I can only stay for one night, and I have to hurry anyway tomorrow morning. This way, convenient If you take me to walk around the city first, then look at the military camp, and finally visit the structural design of the non-fire-extinguishing mountain, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General General and Faschi faintly feel that something is wrong, but if this request does not agree, then it is too much to say. Then the general general said with a hard scalp: "I don't want to have dinner first," said Richard. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he waved his hand indifferently and said: "In the lion I ate a bit at random. Let's go, time is limited, I am the first time I came to the castle of the Earl, I just want to take a good look at the management of the family goddess of war!"<br /><br />&nbsp; General; General; General General, helpless, let the attendants bring a few horses, and Richard each launched, they went down the ramp to the castle gate and walked to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Richard politely asked Faschi to go to rest on her own, she insisted on staying behind. She always had a bad feeling of foreboding, and it was somewhat unconvincing to look at what if Richard had nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-running gryphon flight made her feel exhausted, and Richard was a magician. Even if she had a stronger constitution, how could she still survive? Tossing? Moreover, Richard can still drink water or even eat on the back of the gryphon. It is just like growing up on the back of the griffon. You must know that the flying height is more than 2,500 meters at that time. There are difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Faschi remembered that Richard’s action on the gryphon seemed a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in the city and looks at the city where the smoke is everywhere. This is an emerging city, the scale is not large, only 30,000 people, the planning is neat and tidy. On the edge of the city, you can see a new piece of urban area. The land has been leveled and is beginning to pave the way, but it has not yet been built. Most of the old towns are low-rise buildings. Most of them are years old. The new ones are also unpretentious, but there is a thriving scene everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
