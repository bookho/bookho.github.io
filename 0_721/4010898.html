			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other beast said: "Okay, but let me put it there first. Clean up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely strong jīng god wave is uploaded from the body of the beast and blasts into the plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The void in the crystal wall of the plane suddenly bursts into two sparks, which are the light and fire generated by the burning of the Kingdom of God. The gods that built the Kingdom of God soon fell in this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these tyrans penetrate the walls one by one and enter the newly developed plane, behind them, leaving on the surface wall A huge hollow of different sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal wall of the entire plane trembles, and countless faint spots fly out of the plane, flying to the gap, trying to make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the smallest human sorcerer has a hole that is several kilometers in diameter, but the biggest gap is not the biggest alien. It is an alien that looks like an octopus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forcing through the surface of the crystal wall, the damage is determined by the size of the individual strength, watching the octopus left over 10,000 meters of giant hollow It seems that all the momentum that exists is a stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They chose the highest mountain on the plane, landing one after another, the smallest body is a human mage, and the largest beast is more than a thousand M. All the existences communicate with the fluctuations of the gods, completely eliminating the trouble of language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alien beast said slowly: "There will be several newcomers to participate in the transaction of the fifth airspace. The rules have already been said, if there is no problem. If we do, let's get started now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a violent volatility in the air, and a rare item is displayed and traded. It even includes some complete planes, and there are also sub-planets that are completely preserved in the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the mountain, the human mage is talking to a different mage who is as tall as a few meters, but as thin as a bamboo pole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Richard is present, he will inevitably find that the appearance is actually the black wizard of Dakosodas, but this black wizard is obviously different from the one that Richard has strangled, with a huge inlaid on his forehead. Black sè crystals, taking up most of the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic power of the Black Master only reaches a very high level, and crystals appear on the forehead, which is the crystallization of their magic, through this crystal, black The magic power of the wizard will increase by a considerable amount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dusk, Richard is very reluctant to meet the black wizard who has already manifested the crystal. Such a wizard has almost at least the strength of heaven. Their magic power is enormous. Once they are hit, Richard will be seriously injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this black mage can appear here, the magic crystal almost occupies the entire head, is not an ordinary legendary mage, in fact, he is Dakso Das One of the top ten super strong players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage is now saying: "The end of the day is a big deal, I have to look at it before I can make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master said coldly: "Isn't my credibility enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage smiled and said: "Reputation, are you going to use it to replace the batch of materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master snorted and said: "In our Dax Sodas, the end rì The imprint is also called the bead of disaster. Once it is displayed on this plane, it will bring endless disasters to the plane, and it may lead to the reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The human mage smiled and said, "This plane is also going to be destroyed anyway, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master took out an inconspicuous The wooden box, carefully opened, inside is a pure crystal ball, floating in the heart of a piece of dark metal, there seems to be no special place. But the human mage's pupils were quickly adjusted, and the metal was instantly magnified thousands of times. This time, the wizard finally saw a dense gap line on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a natural metal, but an artificial creation, and the process of making it goes far beyond the imagination of the human mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage looked at him with sorrow and for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this plane has gradually changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and waves on the sea began to intensify, and the dark clouds suddenly surged from the horizon, spreading rapidly to the entire sea, and continued to extend inland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishing boats scattered on the ocean immediately went to the shore like a frightened herd, but their movements were too late, almost in the dark clouds. At the moment of the sky, the storm began to wreak havoc, and in a blink of an eye it was powerful enough to blur the boundary between the sea and the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves at sea have been more than ten meters high. Many powerful sea beasts have been thrown into the air by the wind and waves. When they fall back to the sea, they have lost their lives. Sea beasts are hundreds of meters long, but they are equally vulnerable before the heavens and the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is also shaking, cracks are constantly appearing on the ground, and the cities are gradually shaking, collapsing, sinking into the horizon, and in some places, magma has begun to The underground gushes and spreads along the wounds of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air, I don’t know when there is a strange wind. A huge magic eagle flies in the air. It feels unusually uneasy, just wants to return soon. The nest, but a gust of wind blew, it suddenly flew away, leaving only a skeleton, still fluttering in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an annihilation in the wind, which is derived from the energy storm that comes in from the gap of the crystal wall. Although it has crossed the long space, it is only here. It’s awkward, but it’s as terrible as power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the peak of the mainland, those tyrannical beings are still trading in the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussion of each transaction can sometimes be a few years long, the power is at their level, the life is more than a thousand years of life, so there is no one Lenbi's patience. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage did not say this, staring at the rì mark to see a whole plane rì, and finally spit out a long breath, still said: It’s a miracle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black mage has been floating around to close his eyes and raise his eyes. He opened his eyes and sneered and said: "Where can God do it? This kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage said: "There is still a final step to detect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Better, you humans are troubles."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage does not care, put the hand on top of the crystal ball, slowly input a magic, the crystal ball, the metal suddenly sounds a soft card, and then split into countless parts, The speed changes in various forms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the wooden box suddenly slammed, and the black mage said faintly: "Look enough, if you want to continue watching, buy After you go back, you can look at it with confidence and boldness, but don't do it in front of me. I don't want to be caught by the reaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The human mage nodded and said, "Complete, this is what you want, check it out." He said, he handed a bracelet to the black mage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master activated the bracelet, swept it in with the sense, and saw that the materials were indeed neatly arranged, and nodded at the moment. "It's very good, it's rare for you humans to have a good faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our Solomon Castle Master has always been well-reputed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master smiled low and said: "The materials you gave me are quite critical. With them, we can create three artifacts, and there will be a group of strong people. A breakthrough is made. In the next ten years, on the land of dusk, your Nolanders will see at least ten new legends. Sometimes I really don't understand what you think, and it doesn't matter."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage also smiled and said: "The land of the twilight is a matter of the three great empires. It has nothing to do with us. Sometimes, in order to promote our ideals and create a perfect world, Need to cut off some extra leaves, this kind of thing, you do it, and we do it, What is the difference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Master snorted and said: "Awkward humans, if you are not so smart, maybe we have already played us in the dusk. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is not in our interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, human From the perspective of our Dax Sodas, you are still very welcome. If you have these resources, then we may be able to trade next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The human mage said calmly: "There is of course resources, but what can you do to trade?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dark fruit, or a constant heart core." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human mage’s face suddenly changed, and the breathing became rushed: “After eating, you can grasp the dark fruits of the dark force, which can increase the life of the millennium. "Permanent nucleus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your knowledge is very profound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human Master immediately Determined: "Give me a year, you will get what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction was reached in this way. As for the amount of power that Dakosodas will increase in a dozen years, it is not within the scope of this Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the trade fair, a strong man has left the plane in succession, and when they come, they are also free to go. Leave a huge gap on the crystal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the plane's source is no longer enough to repair all the damage, and the hollowed ones are beginning to expand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continent at the center of the plane is constantly shaking, a little disintegration, annihilation, and it will not be long before this plane will be completely destroyed by the energy storm, and finally Only a piece of ruin remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the information about the fair will be completely annihilated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the crystal wall of Faro, there is a figure of a human mage, the wizard who appeared in the mysterious trade fair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he didn’t have a hard shackle, but he put his hand on the crystal wall and dissolved the obstacle in front of him a little bit. After a while, the crystal wall appeared. A passage that just allowed him to pass, the wizard flashed in and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap in the crystal wall is repaired by the strength of the surface of the plane. It is so difficult to disturb the gods of Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
