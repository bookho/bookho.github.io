			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, Richard is sitting alone in the dark blue meeting room, face Facing the accumulation of various information. He looked at it in a sealed way, and countless pieces of broken pieces gradually became a picture. Although there are still a lot of missing, it has already been contoured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly turned to a magical paper with some strange creatures on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic paper was originally found in the Su Hailun study. Richard asked the jīng coffin to move her desk and all the documents nearby, looking for clues one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is determined to go down, but he must also be cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha believes that he is now fighting Su Hailun. Although he can support it for a while, he will eventually be defeated. Since the enemy can harm Su Hailun, it will not be too difficult to deal with Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic paper was originally unremarkable and was mixed in a pile of useless files. Richard just took a glance and threw it aside. But he suddenly snorted and took the magic paper and watched it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic paper is painted with many strange creatures, and the brushwork is messy, like a graffiti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Richard carefully observed that the material of this magic paper is not dark blue, regardless of the paper used by the common wizard, or exclusive to Su Helun, with powerful magic. The magic paper is very different from this paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper making process is complicated and good, and the structure designed by jīng heart locks a lot of magic, making the storage period much longer than ordinary magic paper. Although its material is not particularly good, but in terms of craftsmanship, it is not much better than the best magic paper dedicated to Su Hailun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a magic paper, seemingly inconspicuous, but the price is bound to be expensive, not the ordinary Master can afford. And such an expensive magic paper, no one will arbitrarily graffiti on it, purely for the practice of pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The many creatures painted on it are not recognized by Richard, but they have common characteristics. In addition, the brushwork for drawing them seems to be poor, and even Richard has not found a law. But no law is a rule, that means chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Richard's heart, he repeatedly looked at it several times and wrote everything he painted on his mind. Then I sent someone to invite Master Phil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Phil, Richard pushed the magic paper to him and said, "Help me find out what is drawn on the paper. This magic paper is very special, I need to know where it came from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil took over the magic paper, looked at it, and felt it from it. The power of faint chaos, I feel a little uncomfortable at the moment. He collected the magic paper and said, "I try to be as fast as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said: "I will go out for a while, about a week or two. When I come back, I hope you can give me the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going..." Firdo asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said faintly: "Blatt apparently participated in the yīn plot, that is, he cheated the teacher. I don’t care if he is dead or alive now, since He dared to hurt the teacher, then I will let him completely regret it. So I am going to destroy all his family. In addition, if his students and friends have a little connection with this matter, they will also kill together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil passed a chill, and wanted to persuade two sentences, but did not know what to say, and finally kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time two more wizards entered the room and placed two letters on the Richards table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two letters are marked with the highest level of confidentiality. One from St. Martin, the other one is Noland's most powerful underground intelligence organization and killer guild shadow brotherhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Brotherhood letter is what Richard has been waiting for, and the price he paid for this letter was 300,000 gold coins. The letter from St. Martin was unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the two letters one by one, and it’s almost the same content. It’s all Blatter’s unknown but close people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at his brows and wrinkled. He hadn’t started yet. How did St. Martin know what he wanted and sent such a letter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking for a while, Richard decided to temporarily put down St. Martin, and now Martin will not fight with him. Richard now has a lot of things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon, the legendary Master Blatter’s direct bloodline, in the territory of the Marquis of Little Blatter, suddenly poured into a large number of strong and constructive Install the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis stood on the main building of the castle and watched the crowds of the sky floating in the air, and even laughed and laughed. The number of opponents who are the sanctuary is even more than his guards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Little Blatter looked at the strong zhōng yāng the handsome but somewhat awkward youth, shouting: "His Highness! What do you mean by this? Why did you attack my territory for no reason? The lord's rights are sacred and inviolable. We are the upper aristocrats of the Holy Alliance. Even if there is some hatred between us, we must also consider it through the House of Lords.... Oh, no!! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Blatter was shocked and stunned to see that Richard was not listening to what he said, but gathered a little fist-sized blue fireball in his hand. . At the same time, he appeared in a different face on Wednesday, and kept thinking about the spell. Countless energy poured into the blue fireball, making it bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a blink of an eye, this fireball has become a giant with a diameter of five meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as this fireball appeared, the people in the Marquis Castle were completely desperate, and from time to time someone flew out of the castle and wanted to escape. However, the castle has long been surrounded by the strong men of Richard, and there are five hundred knights on the outside. No matter which direction they escape, these people will be killed immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the Marquis of Little Blatter knows that it is no longer possible to expect to suppress Richard by the Holy Alliance. Richard does not care about the Holy Alliance. If you care, he will not withdraw from the Holy Alliance so decisively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desperation, Marquis of Little Blatter shouted: "Why? Why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Because you are the son of Blatter," Richard said, then reached for a finger below. The huge blue sè fireball seems to have extremely heavy quality, slowly descending, gradually accelerating, and blasting to the Marquis's castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world suddenly became silent, and the flames of the blue sè blew up in the center of the castle, forming a wave of waves that spread in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blue sè liquid fire, everything seems to fade away, and the layers of buildings are silently melted and turned into nothing. The fire wave has been expanding to a hundred meters, which slowly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire broke out, the center of the Marquis Castle had become a white land. The Marquis of the Little Blatter, removed the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, go to the next one." Richard said faintly, then turned and flew south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary and sanctuary followers follow him, and the knights build a torrent of steel on the ground, rolling south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, Richard’s pro-four legends, thirty sacred strongs at all levels, and five hundred knights. After a thousand miles, the three marquis and the two counts of the Blatter family were wiped out by the ravages. The direct blood of the Blatter family was wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further down, there are some small branch families that do not exceed the Baron. Richard still does not intend to let them go, but he does not need to go to the army to debut. He divides his majesty into several teams. Several strong men lead dozens of knights to the branches of the Blatter family. The purpose is to destroy them. Kill!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the lords understand that Richard is really going to kill the Blatter family. And when Richard just announced this goal, many people actually listened to jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blatter family is a veteran family of the Holy Alliance, and history is much older than Archimonde. It was such a large family of quasi-luxury class, but it was destroyed by Richard in one fell swoop. When the lords reacted and wanted to intervene, Richard had cleared almost all of the main forces of the Blatter family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Alliance has suddenly boiled, and Richard’s actions are undoubtedly a great challenge to the existing system of leadership. Almost every lord has spared no effort to maintain this. A system. Therefore, Richard constantly received protests from various lords, but there was no one who really dared to jump out and block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While clearing the Blatter family, Richard also led the legendary powerhouse and followers to strike lightning and captured all the people on the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
