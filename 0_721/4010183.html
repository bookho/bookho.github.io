			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, many people are curious and surprised by Richard. look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strong people coming and going in the city, and there are also many very young people, but the age is still low. It’s really rare. A powerful family may send younger children to the field to open their eyes, but in this sinister place, the level 13 magician is as fragile as the magic apprentice on the Noland battlefield, even with the guards. It must be absolutely safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since Richard is walking around the night, these people have wisely chosen to turn a blind eye to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, White Night took Richard to the top of the sun-drenched capital. From here, the kilometer tower is spectacular. The bottom of the giant tower has been occupied by the Eternal Dragon Hall. The transfer array back to Noland is also here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s spectacular. This tower was once one of the most famous seven temples on this plane. So far, Noland has been able to There are not many beautiful buildings, but the race to build this tower was completely extinct by Noland. The sound of white night adds a bit of unspeakable taste to this history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night and then pointed out behind Li, and said, "Look back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard turned back, he was condescending, and his eyes were the end of the twilight. This time, the foothold is higher than the first time, and the field of vision is stronger and wider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know why I want to take you to the absolute battlefield?" asked White Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head, he guessed a little, but not sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night said faintly: "The plane war is our fate and the only way for all true powerhouses. Perhaps you will think that the plane war is too cruel, but no The resources and wealth plundered from the numerous sub-planets are not as strong as Noland today. If Noland is defeated in the war between Dakosodas and other sovereign planes, Then the sight you see in your eyes is the future of Noland. The land of dusk will be completely destroyed, this plane will be destroyed, and we and Dax Sodas will open up new battlefields. The cruelest and true battlefield, killing is just like breathing, it is the instinct of everyone here. When a person just touches the plane war, he tends to go to two extremes, one is the meaning of suspicion of killing, and even begins to pity the enemy. The other is to completely immerse yourself in the killing and seek pleasure in it to numb yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha’s heart burst into shock, saying: “I As if both are there, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;White night lightly said: "Remember! Killing is only your means, not your purpose. You just have to consider whether this means can achieve your purpose. Extra things, don't have to think about it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked hard for a long time before he said, "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you need to kill, kill, Give up when you don't need it, everything is so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before entering the transmission array, Richard was still thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip to the fierce battlefield is tantamount to a cruel spiritual baptism for him. From the perspective of the entire Noland, the plane war has long been inevitable, either to continue to ascend or to be destroyed like the land of dusk. In this case, it is meaningless to discuss the meaning of the plane war. So for Richard, either face it or avoid it. In the white night, he showed himself the attitude of responding to killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to Noland again, Richard felt that his heart had been covered with a layer of iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the foreseeable future, the land of dusk will surely be a stop in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha still appears on the floating island of the Duke of the Iron Blood, although it has been in the dusk for a full ten days, but the time flow of the dusk is Nolan Eight times of Germany, so only a little more than a day in Noland. Upon hearing the news of Richard’s return, Agamemnon rushed over and returned the equipment he had kept for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agamemnon’s eyes twitched when he saw the first sight of Richard. The taciturn young man stared at Richard for a few minutes and looked at Richard with some creeps. He nodded and said, "You are finally fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do you know that I have something?" Richard asked strangely. He said that the specific reason why White Night suddenly took him to the field battlefield was not very clear. But when I recalled the expression of Agamemnon and Nyris when I was eating that day, they obviously saw something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this time Agamemnon did not swear: "Everyone who has spent a year or two in a plane war, especially the first paragraph During the development period, there will always be some psychological problems. It is not the best to go to the sub-universal battlefield, but it is the most direct solution, either from this tough or completely crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The look of Li immediately became a bitter, staring at Agamemnon and asking, "Have you done this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is your own idea?" Richard did not believe that Agamemnon would have such determination and courage. Staying in the place of the twilight for a long time, except for a few people with natural optimism and strong will, others will be crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it is forced by the night." Sure enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking briefly with Agamemnon, agreeing on the delivery of the next batch of enchanting equipment, Richard will leave the floating island of the Duke of Iron and Blood and return to Afghanistan. Kemond's floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way to the castle, Richard Road met Faschi. She stopped Richard and looked at it for a long time before she said with certainty: "Richard, you seem to have changed a little!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee smiled: "again Handsome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascic immediately retreated, so Richard laughed and went back to the study. He has to hurry up to explain something to the old butler, and then he will return to Faro. Before entering the Greenson plane, he must relocate in Faro to prevent accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going out of the study, after a long corridor, Richard suddenly saw cocoa standing in the corner of the long window, and he was bowing his head and struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li did not care, just glanced at her, did not stop at the foot, hurried to the stairs. Coco also saw Richard, but his expression changed significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her slight expression changes have been caught in the eyes of Richard, so she stopped to ask: "Cocoa, is there something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no... Cocoa shook his head desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and did not go deep into the building and rushed to the warehouse area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Richard went far, Coco only slammed his feet and hated himself. She obviously had something to beg for Richard, but she really saw Richard, but she couldn’t open her mouth anyway. I missed this opportunity and I don’t know when it was time to see Richard next time. In a hurry, her tears have fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sobbed for a while and walked to the old butler's office. However, she did not go far, she remembered that Richard should have to start again, when the old butler was definitely by his side. At least until the evening, when Richard leaves Norland, the old housekeeper will have time to see her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late at night, Cocoa slammed the door of the old butler's office. Although the time is already late, the old butler's office is still lit. Usually this time the old housekeeper has not fallen asleep, always to a little bit, the old housekeeper will sleep. And around six o'clock the next day, he will get up again. This work has been almost never changed for decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler’s office is very narrow, and all kinds of documents pile up like mountains, occupying most of the office. When I saw Coco, the old butler signaled that she sat down at the table and then read through several documents in her hand. Then she looked up at Coco and waited for her to explain her intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to... ask about my father and my brother..." Coco said uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler helped the glasses and said slowly: "Don't you communicate with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There is communication, but the letter says that they are in a bad state now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait." The old butler took a copy from the filing cabinet. The document, opened and looked at it, nodded and said, "Well, it is true. If your father can't pay back the debt within three months, the territory will be temporarily hosted by the local aristocracy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope... I can borrow some money from my family and help my father to pass this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old steward I glanced at Coco and said, "In fact, this can't solve your father's problem. In addition, what do you pay for it? Your credit limit in the family has already been used up."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa lowered his head deeply and whispered, "First... let's talk about it after this time. Repay the money... I, I will find another way."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have Law. "The old housekeeper very direct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coco suddenly cried and choked and said, "I have tried my best! But... now there is another 珞琪! I... I am a little bit It’s better than her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler shook his head and sighed, took out a piece of paper, brushed a few lines on it, and signed I gave my name to Coco and said, "I think this will give you another half year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cocoa took a look, that It is a cheque that agrees to withdraw 2000 gold coins and is paid from the old butler's private account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
