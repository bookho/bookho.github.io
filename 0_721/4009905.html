			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless void between the plane and the plane, there is a floating Small island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This island is about 100 square kilometers in area, with a high west and low east, and a tiny snow-capped mountain in the west. The top of the snow-capped mountain is a crystal lake. The surface of the lake is so beautiful that the lake flows down from the edge of the mountain and turns into a stream, which is poured into more than ten pools on the mountainside. The pool is obviously built by hand, and each pool edge is made up of a rock of a different material. Looking from afar, the sly drops of water and mist are covered with mountains, and more than ten pools of color have their own colors, and they are like a dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any magician stands on the mountainside at this time, he will be surprised to find that the stream from the top of the mountain exudes a strong magical atmosphere, almost Said to be the magic of liquid! Just take a sip and the effect is much higher than the highest purity magic recovery agent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These magical lakes infused into the pools, miraculously began to transform towards elements of a single attribute, such as wind, fire, earth, light, thunder And so on, it seems that each pool is a purified magic device that extracts an elemental water from the source of magic. Several pools other than the water of the elements are turned into a stock solution of several basic magical agents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of the element pool, there are scattered shiny crystals. It is the crystallization of the strength of the element, the source of the magic, the blood of the magical structure, the alchemy technology, and even the entire magic civilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bottom of the snow-top lake, there is a thick layer of magic crystal, and even some clusters of high-rises are still growing. . The lake has no wind and rushing to wash the crystal, and with the terrain overflowing from the mountain edge, it has taken away some magic power, and the end of the lake has endless clusters of new ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, and even on the edge of the entire island, there is a strange tree growing in dense forest. Their trunks are tall and straight, without leaves, and there are countless golden branches hanging like willows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chaotic forces that fill the plane between the plane and the plane will continue to form an energy storm, whistling, violently impacting the island. When the energy storm hits, the trunks of all the different trees are still moving, and the golden branches are dancing in the storm. The energy in the storm is like the sun and rain that the Noland plants need most, and they are sucked up by these branches. . When the raging energy storm passed through the woods, all the violent energy was almost sucked up and eventually became a breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branches of the different trees will glow with a golden glow after the energy is absorbed, and then the whole tree will shine with it. The light is constantly fluctuating, and part of it shines on the magical wall covering the island, repairing the wall that is also impacted by the space energy storm, and isolating the full influx of the storm. The other part is transmitted to the interior of the island through the roots of the tree, and finally merges into the magic lake at the top of the snow mountain, transforming into pure magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after a while, this balance will be broken. When the energy absorbed by the alien trees on the edge of the island is gradually transformed, the magical protective wall that has not been repaired gradually becomes thinner and gradually unstable under the constant impact of the space storm, and eventually a crack is formed in a thin place on the edge of the island. The energy storm rushed like a tidal wave, tearing everything down the road. However, when the dense forest is covered by a heterogeneous tree, the alien tree will absorb enough energy to repair the retaining wall and infuse the floating island, thus forming a wonderful cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
