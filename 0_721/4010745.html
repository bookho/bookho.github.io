After a while, the distribution information of the Principality of the Principality was gathered from all over the place. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha immediately issued an order to mobilize followers and powerful and powerful, and in just one hour, the star was lifted from the cold iron throne, carrying followers and five Ten knights dressed up, flew toward the dragon valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few hours, dozens of flying dragonflies have also been launched, they carry another 50 knights, and nearly a thousand elite knights . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the main force of the Principality has completed preparations for the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning light of the next day shines on the throne of the Cold Iron, the 30,000-deep Red Principality, which is dominated by the humanoid knight, is drawn out by Gangde. The soldiers pointed directly to the bead of the bead chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in the turbulent land, each of the three nests has a special giant python with a diameter of several tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The python squirmed, and the cracks began to appear on the dark black skin. After a while, the python was finally torn by the creatures inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an indescribable creature that does not have a regular shape at all, like a pile of rotten meat wrapped in a wrinkled skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three huge ugly creatures ate the mink and began to crawl slowly outside the forest. Their bodies were filled with gas and gradually swelled up. Slowly, their bodies turned into huge skulls, and then they no longer crawled, but slowly lifted off, opening a lot of openings under their pleated skin, and spurting out with the rhythm of breathing. The airflow, three giant beasts as long as 100 meters, turned slowly in the air and flew to the scheduled assembly area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three are the largest form of flying locusts, and they are also strategic transportation units. Each flying raft can support a force of thousands of troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small town within the Iron Triangle Empire, Raymond is sitting by the fireplace, planning the next material transportation route against the magic map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period, Richard’s public servants did not move, but Raymond’s workload was even greater. When the army did not move, it was when the materials were reorganized and replenished. This is a work that can't be sloppy, and sometimes it doesn't mean to fight less than the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the side of Raymond, Lei Ya is also working hard. The great emperor is now able to do a lot of work and become a powerful assistant to Raymond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Raymond was writing in his head, he suddenly connected with the consciousness of the brain, and then a large piece of information was transmitted. Raymond is now the mother’s nest. One node can collect a lot of data through the soul link, which is considered to be a small number of benefits from the mother's nest. This time, it is about the information about the newly completed fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the data related to the flying scorpion, Raymond was somewhat lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Raymond, the huge role of the flying scorpion can be seen at a glance, the emergence of this floating behemoth, for Richard’s heavy dependence on logistical support For the military, it has a decisive boost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not problems. For Raymond, the biggest question is why the mother's nest designed this unit. Didn't the mother's nest complete the soul? Still subject to Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul-filling plan can be said to be Raymond’s biggest secret, the biggest attempt in his life, and even the spiritual pillar that now supports him to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the question is rooted, it will grow uneasy flowers on the soil of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond suddenly felt inexplicably irritated, these numbers that used to feel wonderful, but now they are so glaring, he is already looking up at him. Showing a soothing smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He simply walked into the room, away from the door, pacing back and forth near the floor-to-ceiling windows near the garden, repeatedly walking hundreds of laps, Raymond was finally pressing Staying more and more bored, try to summon the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the mother's nest will be late, but its first sentence is: "I am very busy now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond glimpsed, these The changes in the mother's nest since the days are bit by bit, even if there is a brain-shaking between their connections, Raymond can still see the clues. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the performance of the mother’s nest is indeed more and more anthropomorphic, it is only anthropomorphic. The full humanity tone of today is not available before. Its soul loss has repaired at least most of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already have a complete soul." Raymond tried to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have not reached the eleventh order"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a powerful Sillo, I don't need to evolve to the eleventh order, so I can get the full soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Raymond’s heart was suddenly filled with great joy, so that he ignored the syllable, and Sillo, who couldn’t even distinguish himself for a time, because he personally experienced it only in the research notes. The soul completed the plan, or because it reached the goal of initially finding trouble for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fixed his mind and said, "So between you and Richard"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I need my help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond lost the voice: "Master,."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master It’s Richard.” The mother’s nest explained patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, you already have a complete soul, you should not get rid of his control." Under the horror, Raymond even forgot to forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true, but" the turning point that the mother's nest spit out suddenly made Raymond's eyes black. He reached out and held the shelf on the fireplace, barely supporting If you live yourself, you can listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel better to maintain a previous relationship with my master." Every word spoken by the mother's nest is like a thorn in the heart of Raymond. A knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But" Raymond took a deep breath, but suddenly could not find anything to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest is not a human being. Although it has a complete soul, it has emotions of emotions, but these are just new experiences for the mother nest. In essence, it is still a war weapon with a brain capacity much larger than that of a normal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest can only be induced without being persuaded. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the mother’s nest now says that Richard’s relationship with the past is better, it means that this is the conclusive answer from the mother’s nest after careful calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Raymond can no longer propose a plan similar to the completion of the soul, then it is impossible to convince the mother's nest completely out of Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a soul-filling plan that has been the result of many years of accumulation by Solomon's scholars, and although Raymond's individual strength is not outstanding, it is heavier. Learned Solomon Castle, his status is not low, so he will have the authority to know the soul to complete the plan, and now want Raymond to come up with a similar bait, but it is impossible to kill him, perhaps only for the Rohmenburg University students have this ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awkwardly thinking for a moment, Raymond suddenly had a boring chest and a spurt of blood, and the person fainted softly. After a while, he was in the middle of it. Like what I heard, I woke up and saw that Leya was standing in front of her, holding a short sword, and was yelling at something. Raymond saw her elegant and straight back trembled, apparently very Scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond coughed and struggled to sit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leia immediately trembled and said, "You wake up, great, these, what are these things."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond looked at the door. It turned out to be a dozen strange worms similar to bees. Each one has a length of 20 cm. When the worm is large enough, it will become very scary. For humans who are used to their normal size, it is definitely a visual impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several worms on the floor in the room, but there are more than a dozen dancing outside the door, and it is possible to rush in at any time. Lei Ya holds the short sword, and the sword front is still shaking. Most women are naturally afraid of all kinds of bugs, and these giants are surprisingly powerful, and she must fight with all her strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing these giant worms, Raymond smiled a bit and pulled Reya behind him and said, "It doesn't matter, they are coming to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Raymond stretched out his arm, a giant worm fell immediately, and the mouth was nailed into his upper arm. Leiya exclaimed, but then saw the giant worm constantly injecting the juice into the abdomen. In Raymond's arm, with the injection of juice, Raymond's pale face quickly became bloody, and the original weak and intermittent breath gradually became thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leia couldn’t help but widen his eyes and asked: "What is going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Raymond smiled a bit and said: "Go back and say to you, wait for me now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond closed his eyes and again The consciousness of the nest is connected: "I am alive, is it still useful to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is of no use to me, but there is still some value to the owner." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond’s bitter smile said, “Do you think that I will still work for Richard now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the mother's nest is dull and cold: "Why not, although the Solomon Castle Master is absolutely unspeakable, but as a flesh-and-blood life, your instinct for future generations should still exist. Do you not want to look at your own? Child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child." Raymond was shocked and couldn't help but glance at Leia, then angrily asked in consciousness: "You are right Lei Ya made ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need to do anything, you don't need to be so angry." The voice of the mother's nest has not changed, continue to say: "As long as I am willing Reya can have your child at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond smiled sarcastically and asked: "My child."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nest does not care about Raymond’s ridicule, saying, “Your child.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How can I make sure that it’s mine? Child, how do I know that you will not be on the child's ** or genetically, and when I am old, maybe my beloved child will become like this in front of me." Raymond Pointing at the giant worm on the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
