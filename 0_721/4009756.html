			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic clock points to the night, and the floating world is also shrouded in the night. However, the night of Faustian is not black and white, but colorful. The ends of the sky are hung with the blue moon of the fourth string and the moon of the fifth string, and the blue and purple moonlight are intertwined and laid down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it is to prove the real existence of this world. If you walk out of the floating gate at this time and look up to the night sky of the eternal plateau, it will be farther away from the visual effect of the floating world. Many of the sky also hang the fourth and fifth string months, perhaps because it is too far away, the colored moonlight can not cross this distance, so the night of Noland's mainland is black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light belt stays up all night, still hovering over the floating sky, slowly rotating along the mysterious track. The seven rounds of the moon also continually swim with the light belt, and the trajectory implies a certain law. However, since the occupation of the floating world, human beings have never been enlightened to reveal the secret of the rainbow in July. Tonight is the month of the blue and the dying, and the corresponding fourth and fifth chords on the rainbow in July are much darker. But no matter when, the seventh month of the Red Golden Moon is always the darkest one. In addition to a few days in a year, ordinary people can hardly see its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloud surrounding the floating world is actually a huge magical array, its existence makes the climate of the fauna in the four seasons warm and balanced, and the eternal plateau chill Cold and cold is very different. At night, in the diffuse cloud, there are occasional magic threads that emit a ray of light, and thousands of magic threads gather together, so that the cloud also has seven colors of brilliance. So the floating world at night is gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating island of the high-level track is floating silently, while the six- and seven-story floating islands are brightly lit. It brings together all the powerful families of the Holy Alliance, and every minute and every count has countless conspiracy and transactions in the making and happening. The places where the conspiracy and the transaction are conceived are nothing more than secret rooms and banquets. Therefore, there are a large number of secret rooms on each floating island, and almost every night, there are various kinds of banquets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Archimonde family is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight's banquet is not too big, it is held in a building near the edge of the floating island near the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This three-story building was originally designed for large banquets or gatherings, and even outside the building, the garden was built according to the habits of ordinary nobility. On the north side of the first and second floors is a large room with a movable partition, which can be flexibly divided into halls for various purposes according to the needs of use, and the south side is a lounge of different sizes. Half of the third floor is the terrace, facing the island. The roof is designed to be a rooftop style, where you can enjoy the beautiful views of other floating islands and fauna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the north side rooms on the ground floor are now opened to the whole hall, the lights are bright, the long tables on both sides are full of food, the slaves and the servants shuttle around. Bring a glass of red wine to the guests who need it, then take the empty cup away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner, a band is playing hard, but the level is not perfect. However, the guests are not interested in music and wine, but the opportunity to talk to each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cloister outside the hall, eight lounges of different sizes were opened today, while the lounge on the second floor was more. These private spaces provide the necessary convenience for the demander, can talk, or sneak. If it is the latter, many people are more interested in the gardens outside the green trees. Although the chances of being broken are much larger, the stimulus will be much greater, not to mention that most people don't care about being seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
