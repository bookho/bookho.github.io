			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huang Tie Jing and Maple Amber are rare materials commonly used in second-order construction. The former needs to find rare veins, but the latter can only be excavated from ancient ruins. It is very scarce on the mainland of Noland, and is measured entirely in grams. If it is measured by the price of Noland, the price of this yellow iron crystal is only about 100,000 gold coins, and such a huge and complete piece of maple amber can sell more than 200,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information collected by Richard, there is a very shallow understanding of the current price system of this plane. Twenty magic crystals can probably Selling nearly 10,000 gold coins, but that is the price in the human kingdom. Due to the rarity of the mage and the monopoly on the high-end magic equipment market, most magicians have exclusive special channels, rarely procuring from the market, and magic. The apprentice's consumption is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the bloody land, these good magic materials are sold without bidding. Because of the turbulence of blood-staining areas, transportation costs often account for more than one-third. After all, if you have something, you have to have a fate to get it. Therefore, it is not bad that this batch of materials can sell three or four thousand gold coins. If it is placed in Noland, the total price of this standard unit of magic crystal can be around 20,000 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huang Tie Jing and Maple Amber can appear in the warehouse of the Thunder Hammer, and it is still such a large part, and there is no distinction, just mixed with a pile of materials Together, it shows that their production is very large in this plane, but the use is limited. From the price of different magic materials, Richard can roughly infer that the level of magical alchemy is very backward, and Noland is not at the same level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quiet and ordered a dozen materials. Huang Tiejing and Maple Amber were also mixed in other materials, and then asked about the price one by one. Sure enough, Huang Tiejing and Maple Amber can only be ranked in the middle of these materials, and the hammers are only evaluated for two or three hundred gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total value of the stock magic material that the hammer has taken out is about 10,000 gold coins. If there is a smooth trade channel, it can sell nearly 30,000 in the human country. More gold coins. At the beginning, Richard’s looting of a shrine did not reach 100,000 gold coins. Now, in the small camp on the edge of the blood-stained area, it is easy to see the wealth of more than 30,000 gold coins. I can imagine this land. How lucrative the opportunity is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the richer the opportunity, the more bloody and killing. A half-orc tribe with no magical talent at all, but possesses such a wealth of magical materials, the source naturally does not have to say. Richard secretly speculated that if he did not enter the camp as strong as he entered the camp, and simply killed the bloody mark, he would become a contributor to the magic material. Not to show the powerful magical power, let the Thunder hammer rise to the idea of ​​trading with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if these magic materials are in Noland, the total value is close to 500,000 gold coins! At this point, Richard finally realized one of the sources of the huge benefits of the plane war. The root of it is nothing more than the trade of tight materials in the two places. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; all they can to Richard lingua franca of the magic of picking out materials, coupled with the box of magic crystal, a sum roughly equivalent to 8000 gold, then say : "For these, plus twenty adult soldiers." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; thunder hammer a little hesitant, but eventually a wave, all the materials are wrapped up, Richard throw, then Chen Sheng asked: "? when can I get something" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Three days later, and I need to start it for you. This process also takes a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder hammer hits a punch on the table, Shen Sheng said "I have waited for five years, don't care to wait a few more days! But, I hope you don't let me down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha seems to be hitting the thunder hammer The murderousness was completely ignorant, but the bag in the hand was thrown, thrown to Gangde, and then faintly said: "As a noble mage, I cherish my credibility very much. And the world of magic is magical. It's not something that ordinary people can understand. So I also advise you to doubt that a magician is a very stupid thing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call The two beards of the thunder hammer were blown up, and the muscles of the body also squirmed. But in the end, he forced himself to hold his own anger. There was no other action. He just stared at Richard and said, "Three days later, I am waiting for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Richard nodded and left the bloodstone tribe war castle with a rich harvest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the hotel, Richard took a shot of Gangde and smiled and said, "Good job!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde opened his mouth and laughed and said, "This is alive and me! I used to have nothing to do with pigs and tigers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just before the Thunderbolt, Gangde only stimulated the ability of the structure just over half, the power bonus is less than 30%. Thunder hammer believes that it is the peak power of Gangde, in fact, because of the superb acting skills of Gangde. This big man not only made his face purple, but his neck and blue veins were beating. In a short period of time, there was still a sweat and almost wet the standing ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adapt to your new build, there will be more in the future." After that, Richard took all the materials back to his room, ready Organize the collected magic materials into categories. The harvest was huge, and after being inspired by the sands that night, he had already had several initial ideas for the new construction, but was limited by the lack of materials. After obtaining this batch of materials, the number of standard structures that can be made from existing resources can be increased from four to nine, and even six special designs can be produced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going upstairs, Richard suddenly saw the figure of the splash. The feeling of the girl’s back is a bit bleak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the doubts just flashed through the bottom of my heart, and Richard returned directly to his room, and after finishing the new materials, he re-rolled the tools. Prepare to make the structure for the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a structure that retains only the basic functions, but the performance is severely shrunk in all aspects. The construction area has tripled, but the wide back of the Thunderbolt is enough to carry such a huge build. The part of the magic array that consumes more expensive materials can be deleted or deleted, and the specially designed magical array circuit that reduces the bearing capacity needs to be removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the structure born in the hands of Richard will need to be actively stimulated, and the requirements for carrying capacity even exceed the degree of second-order construction, energy consumption. It is one and a half times more than the one in Gangde, and the final strength is only 20%, and it is not very stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only unique design is that Richard designed an absorption array for the magic array, which absorbs the energy of the magic crystal embedded in it, thus exciting the structure. . A magic crystal can be configured to run for about an hour and a half, which means it can be fully activated nine to ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
