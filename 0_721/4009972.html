			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute!" The general finally stood up and said: " After a clue, you can't attack the whole army immediately. You need to send a reconnaissance cavalry to explore it first. It is likely to be a trap..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trap?" The Viscount is not excited. Staring at the general, said coldly: "Before sending out the troops, you promised me that I can successfully defeat Richard. You will not tell me now, the nearly two thousand elite warriors here can't cope with a pioneer knight three. Hundreds of people?! Do you want to tell me this, um!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General’s words, military strength, and proper command. But this sentence he did not say smartly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, the detective rider of the Guard Captain found the trail of the Richards. So the viscount of Heim, the whole army, was opened up and chased after the mighty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more traces left by the Richards along the way, the Guard Captain’s face is more brilliant, and the general’s face is more and more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, the Viscount’s army has already caught up with the bloody land, the junction of the Sequoia Kingdom and the turbulent land. The terrain here is high and low, the terrain is complex, and there are caves, stone forests and rift valleys everywhere. The team of hundreds of people will be scattered inside, and they can be hidden casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the persuasion of the general, the Viscount finally gave up the plan to pursue the night, but chose to camp on the spot. This night, Richard really came to the night, and more than once. It was only the night defense of the Viscount camp that was much stricter than usual. Richard’s night attack failed to succeed, but he only woke up the Viscount a few times. But after the heavy casualties of the first night attack, no one dared to take it lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, at dawn, the poorly-populated Viscount struggled to put on the armor, and then went to the war with the entourage. When the Viscount climbed high, he suddenly saw a familiar figure in the distant highlands. Even though they were far apart, Him knew at a glance that it was Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Richard was riding in the battle, and looking at the army of the distant Viscounts began to move, rolling toward himself, could not help but smile, said to the flowing sand around me: "This time I won again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liu Sha reluctantly snorted and said: "Come on how long he will chase you this time. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least three days." Richard said leisurely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On his physical strength and perseverance? I bet one day." Liu Sha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said, "Three days! But you have to cooperate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He snorted and said, "Well, this time I lost, I will definitely resist! I really doubt if you really have elf blood, so violent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not violence, but conquest." Richard corrected the sand and, by the way, defended his actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the army of the Viscounts, Richard Susong, raised his hand and recruited behind him. So a dozen barbarian warriors emerged from behind Li, and they became a series of crossbars. The Shamin Knights also screamed at the top of the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viscount Heim exclaimed excitedly: "He is finally ready to fight like a nobleman! The whole army will attack! This time I must kill him completely! You see no, he has a lot of infantry under his hand, and finally I am caught up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sparsely warrior at the top of the steep slope, Viscount Heim immediately circumvented the general, commanding the army to divide the three roads, and the two wings each with one The team's infantry attacked and tried to get rid of Richard's back road. The main force attacked from the front. The Viscounts naturally stood behind the front line and supervised the army under the guards of the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle started quickly and ended quickly, but it was very different from the bloody knight war that the Viscount had expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard summoned six violent bears on the top of the steep slope, and then the thick-skinned guy screamed into the striker's army. The violent bear's combat power is not very outstanding, but the vitality is very tenacious, the power of running is very amazing, and suddenly the Viscount striker is disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Viscounts on the right side of the road passed a giant stone pillar, they suddenly flew a flying axe from the stone pillar, and the top ten light cavalry All fallen down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right-wing troops have not recovered from the chaos, and the air screams again in the air, and a flying axe whirls, and the remaining cavalry have fallen. under. The right-wing warrior saw the enemy, but suddenly stayed. The weird appearance of the throwing soldiers is no exaggeration to show that they are not human at all. However, the well-trained Viscount Infantry was just a stay, and screamed and rushed up, but the head-on was a flying axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the flying axe is absolutely inconsistent with the bow and arrow, perhaps only a shot can be compared. In addition to the heaviest tower shield, any shield armor of the infantry soldiers can't stop the throwing of the Axe! After the wave of axe whizzed past, there was a blank in the infantry line! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thunderous hoofs, the squad of more than twenty barbarians and sandmen knights smashed out from Shifeng, and cut into the infantry. The queue, the moment of the impact, let the soldiers fall down. The right-wing infantry was slammed and immediately showed signs of collapse, and many people began to hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment hesitated but was in the middle of the investigation of the troops, the Shamin Knights and the barbarian warriors covered the throwing soldiers to quickly retreat, and in a blink of an eye they ran far. On the frontal battlefield, Richard left all the mobile forces. After the Shamin Knights had an assault and disrupted the formation of the Viscounts forward, Richard led the team to slant through the battlefield and once again smashed through the retaliated right-wing troops that had been hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me chase! They have infantry, can't escape!" Earl of Him was sullen and pale, and Richard's rush to escape gave him enough power. confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chase is three days and three nights, and it is almost three days and three nights that cannot be combined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard fled during the day and attacked at night, it seems that energy is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different types of night raids, sometimes violent bears that suddenly appear in military camps, sometimes fireballs that are suddenly shot, and sometimes all units are assembled. There was even a black warrior suddenly appearing near the Viscount camp. Unprepared, the Viscount's elite guards were killed by the fierce undead. Every attack will bring losses to the Viscount's army, ranging from a dozen or more to dozens of people, making Hem feel very painful, but not afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, when Himself became exhausted, he could no longer afford the pursuit. Him's physical strength and energy are more powerful than the average person, and the blood of the unicorn is the guarantee of his body quality. When he can't stand it, the ordinary warrior is already tired and just wants to sleep for a few days. Until then, the Viscount found that the troops he had brought were already less than a thousand people, more than one-third of the damage, and the elite cavalry was almost lost, the soldiers were still there, but the cavalry without the horse was not as good as the infantry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
