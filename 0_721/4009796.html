			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three consecutive days on the sea, the ship has long since deviated General route, but on the fourth morning, Samuel has already appeared in the eyes of the watchmen. This is a large island with an area of ​​tens of square kilometers. The mountains in the west have more than one spring, solving the most important freshwater problem. Forests that cover most of the islands also provide the necessary timber for port construction. When Richard set foot on the plane, a small port and a small village will be built on Samui. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship was anchored near the shore, relying on a boat to send people and supplies to the island. And Richard and the sand and Lina went into the forest to find the right place to set up the portal. As the soul guard of Richard, the water flower is not far away from the surroundings. Through the soul contract, Richard can occasionally feel the slightest joy in the head, as if she is happy to return to the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Lina selected a piece of flat land halfway up the mountain, opened the space bag, took out a piece of magic crystal, and began to arrange the transmission array. The transmission array is extremely complicated, and even Lina needs at least a day to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, Richard ignited several bonfires around the open space, sitting on the edge of the bonfire and roasting the prey caught by the water. Lina is still working, and the magic crystals that are placed in place flash from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this position, you can see that there are several bonfires lit up at the beach and more than a dozen tents. After Richard has embarked on the plane from here, they will stay to build the dock and set up the village. If it goes well, it will continue to live here for generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire continually jumped, reflecting the face of Richard and the quicksand. Neither of them spoke. Although this is a relatively safe low-level plane, it is only relatively safe. No one can say what will happen in a strange plane. So before the departure, the pressure became huge and real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very uncomfortable night. Several lions glided quietly in the shadow of the colorful string moon, and finally landed on the floating island of VII on the SF, under the mastery of the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the luxurious and comfortable living room of the 7-1 Floating Island Castle has gathered several people who are important throughout the floating world. More importantly, they appear here, not on their own behalf, but on the entire family behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center is sitting on a majestic old man, Duke Bill Mensa, the Mensa family chief who occupied the floating island 7-1. Like Joseph, the Mensa family is also a veteran of the Holy Alliance, and the family history is even longer than the history of the Alliance. The strength of Mensa is as large as Joseph, which can be seen from the ranking of the floating island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa on the left side of the Duke of Mensa, sitting with Baron Raymond Joseph, who represented the entire Joseph family to the secret meeting. On the right side of the Duke, there is also a handsome and somewhat sulky young man, who is the Viscount of the Welling family. The Duke of Wellingborg, the floating island of Gaojing 6-3, is a truly important figure in the league. The representative of the Schumpeter family on the floating islands of 7-7 can only sit at the head of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four families gathered together to represent a very large force. The core issue of the secret meeting is the threat posed by the Archimonde family and Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
