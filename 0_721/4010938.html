The major giants. The six bloods of Midrande, the holy sword waving like the wind, and the domineering of the dragon, can be said that the earthquake has smashed the hearts of every young man and made them flammable. combustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the scene of the second day of the battle between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cook has long had his own dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nephew of the Grand Duke of the Holy Tree Dynasty, he has already served as a middle-level position in the Southern Army. Instead, he does not need to use valuable points like some people. Redeem the goods that the family needs urgently. For example, the second place, the third place, is ready to redeem a set of wild knights to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to 100 points, let Cook's eyes fall on the legendary level of equipment. One of them can reverse the shield of the magic below the eighth level, and a long sword with powerful Thunder power is what he needs, but now he can only choose one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee handed the score card to Cook and smiled and asked, "Would you like to redeem it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Richard’s gaze, Cook immediately felt a little nervous. In fact, Richard is of the same age as him, but Cook’s heart in front of Richard is not born. The gap between the two sides is too far away, and it is far from the point where there is no way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to pick the same in the Magic Shield or the Shining Thunder, but I haven't decided yet." Cook honestly said his own idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a slight raise in his eyebrows and said: "This does not seem to be the best choice for you. Well, there is a natural in the fourth-order structure. Take control, I think it is suitable for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature control? Ok, thank you, I will consider it!" Cook did not immediately accept. Even in the face of the peak of the mainland like Richard, he insisted on his own judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha smiled and said nothing and went to second place. Whether Cook is willing to follow his own arrangements is his own choice. Or, it depends on his luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural control is all about the ability of the auxiliary class, which allows the user to greatly improve the adaptability to the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only Richard, who is a producer, knows best. In fact, this is a shrinking version of the king of metal, so the control of metal is particularly strong. Although it can't be used as a weapon for vertical opponents, it can greatly increase the energy of its own metal equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most direct improvement of the combat power for Cook, who is on the offensive and defensive line. And the structure can follow its own life, but the equipment can be replaced. With better equipment after the rì, Cook’s choice today is a bit wasteful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Richard also understands Cook’s choice. As a young man with a background that is not so rich, but has certain family support, choose a legendary equipment. Very normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Cook died, this piece of equipment could be passed down from generation to generation as a heirloom. The structure will weaken the effect with the death of the strong, and the reinforcement will not only cost a lot, but also people who are at least as good as the original author. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is foreseeable that in the next few hundred years, there will be no more people like Richard, and even if there is, it may not coincide with his field of expertise. Then, the structure of Richard's hand-made system will inevitably be weakened from generation to generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the choice of the most suitable one, or a less suitable equipment, depending on Cook's confidence and ambition. Richard saw his own shadow from Cook, so he mentioned him, but the choice was still in Cook's own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony was over, and many of the big men’s emotions became a bit more high. The performance of these young people did indeed show the future of Noland. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the era of plane wars, many high-ranking big men have a big Nolanist plot, Noland has limited space, and the plane is limited. It is unlimited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They prefer to see a group of equally powerful partners screaming on the battlefield and inserting flags into large and small planes. No matter which family's family emblem is embroidered on the banner, it represents the same place, Noland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dinner party, the rich and beautiful food, as well as the numerous vintage wines, highlight the luxury and taste of the Archimonde family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between nouveau riche and wealthy is the details, and Richard hires the top ceremonial masters of the entire Noland. Even if the preparation time is more compact, the layout here has not been reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time from recipes to drinks, to when and how to match each wine and snack, is from their hands. This dinner, even the most discerning big nobility can not find any flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was a year ago, Richard just took control of Archimonde, and the dinner at that time was quite comparable to the giants, but it could still be Pick out a lot of deficiencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main course can be the same, but in the ritual etiquette of tableware, drinks and even servants, Archimonde will still inadvertently reveal the upstarts. In the Gordon period, Archimonde's large-scale banquet was not only a small number, it was simply sour, even if the dinner of an Earl's family was stronger than the archaeological island of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Gordon’s style is not to pay attention to this, he will only raise the level to what he thinks is justified, and that’s it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Gotton’s conviction is that the standard is a bit too low. What the rough man often said is that instead of spending money to invite the nobles to eat, it would be better to add a piece of meat to the soldiers' bowls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now Richard has embarked on a completely different path from Gordon. Originally as a sacred architect, the speed at which he gathered wealth was quite terrible. Now he has developed a point redemption system. The gold coins are rolling in, and the speed of wealth growth is simply daunting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now only thinks that there is a Jinshan in front of him that needs to work hard to be able to stand up to his own conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through this dinner, Richard proved to the old-fashioned giants in disguise that the nouveau riche was considered to be a nouveau riche, but only because of the extent of the outbreak Not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dinner, Richard's daughter naturally became one of the protagonists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy is not like the one he was born in, the bright eyes are curiously watching everyone present. The dark red sè that flows through her pupils is naturally seen by many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her rapid growth and precociousness is a powerful testimony. To know that the young dragon just climbed out of the egg, there is no wisdom in the adult class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lord and the strong are surrounded by Richard, and the compliments are just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy also demonstrated the ability of cāo to control the abyssal flame under the direction of Richard. This naturally aroused a burst of exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, many of the lords with the same status as Richard began to look for various excuses to get along with Richard alone, and then solemnly proposed a marriage proposal, the object Nature is this little guy who was just born a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the man, Richard can be arbitrarily appointed among their families. In addition, according to the usual practice, the big lords of these powers may have promised various benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, Richard smiled and smiled a lot. The feelings of these big lords were a lot better. This is the real compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little guy was named Freire by Richard, meaning the firefighter in a similarly spoken language. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Richard handed Xiaofulle to the maid and took it back to sleep, he entered the next core link and organized the conference. It was past midnight, but everyone was so excited and untiring. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue was quickly arranged, and Richard had already been familiar with it. After he took the stage, he gave a detailed explanation and demonstration function to an enlarged design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour or so, the ten-piece suite of the Midrande battle version was explained one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee splits into two pieces of the carapace in the magic image, saying: "...this is the wing of the blush, also the Midalun The last piece of the suit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence in the audience, and the great people of Noland had looked at the six stretched 光è light wings in the magical image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who are well-informed. When Richard explains it, they know that this is indeed beyond the fifth-order structure. Some are powerful! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This informal assembly conference is destined to go down in history, and they are all witnesses of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it was, a duke sighed and said, “Sure enough, it’s a gods!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this moment on, Richard has surpassed many of the current sacred architects in history and history, becoming the first sect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clap his hands, turned off the magic image, and then put on a new structure, solemnly said: "Here, I will show A historical, yet new, holy construct. Its power has reached the fifth-order peak, and even on many occasions, its role will transcend all holy structures. The only limitation is that this is a mage-only Constructed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legendary mages in the venue suddenly got excited, they looked at each other and thought of a possibility, a possibility to make them feel at ease ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richardton paused and said, "This is the great creation of His Royal Highness St. Lawrence, the real magical arm! Its only function is to transform the magic." For vindictiveness, there is a slight loss in the room, but it is absolutely acceptable. This magical armed weapon can provide legendary vindictiveness! Perhaps after he has, the biggest trouble is that our mage also needs to practice swordsmanship."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard rarely said a joke, but this time the audience was no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No laughter is issued. People's eyes were all focused on the magical armed forces, and they whispered in excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mage, and the fact that a close friend is a mage is a joy, and a mage with a hate is serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this is a structure that is enough to change the professional balance of the warfare. In the future, when the legendary warrior meets the legendary mage, it is very likely that he will not have to fight at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
