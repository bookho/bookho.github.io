			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where Richard’s counterattack is a key part, they plan to hide in The five hundred elite knights in the territory gave Richard a head-on blow, and thus got the truth, thinking that it would be used for the next attack on Richard's territory. After all, they are not the Viscounts of Him, openly invading the territory of another aristocracy, and it would be very troublesome if the accused went to the Star Court. If Richard does not follow the normal complaint path, they will be more troublesome, which means that Richard can also legally invade their territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team from Richard’s territory has only fifty cavalry guards. Although the samurai cavalry is brave and warlike, it has never been placed even at the kingdom level. The eyes of the Eagle Knights have passed. On the identity, the Shamin is a slave. On the individual's combat power, the average five-level Shamin cavalry can't compare with the elite knights of the seven or eight levels. In the end, the sand people are often a piece of sand, and there is no organization or military discipline at all. Such a team and the elite of the Knights play against each other. A squadron of 100 elite knights can kill three times the already-sanded cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before the battle began, several real powers gathered in the baron of Fontaine led the Knights of Latour, the Golden Sphinx Sir Campbell Bubka, the great magician Thornst, Xerxes’s tenth-level priest Barn, and the little baron’s uncle, all believe that there are no doubts about the two hundred eagle-flag knights against the fifty-sand cavalry. . It’s only a small amount of credit if you don’t let one person escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, everyone was completely shocked when they witnessed the bodies of two hundred Eagles knights being hung on wooden stakes. Only Richard did not put any knight to escape, so no one of these big men on the baron’s territory knew the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also found the battlefield, but it has obviously been destroyed by the hearts of the people. The traces of such horrible battles are not caused by any military forces of Richard that they know. of. Apart from being shocked, there is only doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the anger was vented, Earl Latour’s face was gloomy. He expected that Richard would take a bite, but he did not expect that this bite was too painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murder of the Viscount of Heim and this fierce counterattack made the Count of Latour clear the weight of Richard. Never look at Richard from the perspective of a jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explore the Cavaliers, Count Latour thinks about this term that is almost forgotten in its original meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another identity of Richard is to develop the knight. He has no prominent title, no base, no replenishment, and no army to talk about. However, it was such a pioneering knight who won the record of the army of the Viscounts of Hiran, and did not know what means to use, so that the hawkers of the two squadrons all died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy battle report reminded Latu of the era of human pioneering thousands of years ago. At that time, the human kingdom occupied less than one-fifth of the territory. It was at that time that the human kingdom divided a large number of pioneering knights, one by one to open up the knights to hold high the battle flag, and led an army that was not strong, but did not hesitate to enter the vast dark world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an era of heroes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be time to develop the Cavaliers to defeat the strong enemy, from the hands of the aliens to take a piece of fertile land. Their record is unbelievable and cannot be viewed with an ordinary military vision, but the head and the fertile land of the aliens are the most solid and powerful proof of the record. Countless names of pioneering knights stand out in battles one after another. They either become unsuccessful commanders, and others rise like a comet and become the strongest of the Megatron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
