			<div id="content"><br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; () <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Agamemnon has soared into the sky, quietly hands Sword Go to the Elf Youth. This sword is extremely pristine, purely winning with speed and strength, and seeing the elf youth is also a bright spot. He scored on one foot and each stepped on the head of a royal stepping knight. The spear flew in his hand, and opened the giant sword of Agamemnon, and then stabbed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agamemnon is not sounding, and the sword is like the wind, like a squally shower to the elf, there is no sword at all, completely Instinct to attack! In this round of mad attack, Agamemnon showed his true strength. Even if it is an ordinary sanctuary, it is difficult to get through this round of crazy attacks. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; elf eyes got brighter, the eyes have a full appreciation of the meaning is, however spear in his hand was lightning fast, step-refundable, mouths and Ajia The doorman attacked. In the past, the three spears have regained their inferiority. The spears are more like electricity, and they immediately forced Agamemnon to turn from attacking and defending. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Elf spear suddenly labeled a sword of Agamemnon, then his wrist flick, sword spears with Janus drew three small Circle, and then pick up, let the giant sword suddenly fly into the air! Agamemnon did not want to let go of the sword and clenched the hilt, so the whole person was taken by the giant sword. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; elf raising his hand to relieve young roots before Lile forehead, revealing a bright smile, hands Lvmang is flashing, scarred scarred, in There were more blood holes in the heads of the eight royal guards around him. The people were already standing on the spot, and then they took the elf youth as the center and neatly went out. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; snip, at the foot of the young wizard issued two record clear voice, which he used as a stepping stone to the two fighter skull fracture, are still standing. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; young wizard narrowed his eyes, eyes slowly swept across the battlefield, looking for the next target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has created chaos at this moment, the elf youth’s movements are soothing, almost everyone can see clearly, but every tiny movement he has Bring a picture of the afterimage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, time has not passed in the past, because Oral has not fallen to the ground, Agamemnon is involuntarily rising. And Richard's face was pale, just to save Oral's life, forcibly issued a six-level lightning, and used sacrifice. Now he has a hot heat in his body. And his hand just reached into his arms, and the book he carried was only half taken out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sacred glory fell on Oral, and the blood that spurted his chest was instantly relieved. This powerful treatment comes very timely and is likely to save the life of the elf poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth turned his eyes and fell into the drifting sand of the hands between the radiance of the gods. Seeing the sand, the elf youth eyes brightened, then shook his head again. It seemed that it was a pity to obliterate such a beautiful girl, so he moved his eyes again and finally stared at Scher, no longer drifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher as a frog stared at by a snake, in an instant, the whole god is on alert, and he does not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth strode forward, but next to Nyris vacated, holding an axe and killing! The noble and charming four emperors are on the battlefield, but they have never lost their hardships. The elf youth carefully looked at the appearance of Nyris, and sprinkled a few spears, let the four emperors take off their hands, and then spear the cross, using the blade plane to shoot on the chest of Nyris, and flew him out. Nyris snorted, his chest stuck, and he had not broken the number of ribs, and a blood spurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth no longer cares about Nyris, but walks to Shir, and the spears in his hands are so fast that they can't see the entity at all. Every step is taken, and they don't know how many spears to prick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher double sword dance into two groups of glare, step back, the face has been completely distorted. His double sword suddenly flew into the sky, and the elf spear gently touched his eyebrows. He touched back and left only a negligible red dot on Sheer’s forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sher is standing stiff, his hands hanging on his side, his eyes stunned, his face solidified with an incredible look. He shook, and suddenly his head was blown into a bloody fog! The headless body is still standing still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth smiled, and the spear hovered in the hand for a few laps, bringing out countless afterimages, and it looked very calm. However, his smile suddenly solidified and looked up into the sky. A lightning bolt entangled in dark red blood descended from the sky, just on his forehead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hit by the seven-level chain lightning, the elf youth also snorted, and the natural light of the body has dimmed a lot. For the first time in his eyes, he flashed his murderousness, his eyes fell on Richard again, and he took the first step toward Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha looked fierce, quickly flipped the book of the bearer, and a flash of lightning fell on the head of the elf youth, completely blasting his natural light! At this time, Richard jumped into the electric fire in the body. Under the action of the magical movement, the speed increased sharply and suddenly flashed horizontally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth has a sneer smile on his face, and the speed is almost three points faster! He had already rushed over his head, and now he turned and he had already caught up behind Richard. Richard also sneered, he was still flipping the book of the bearer when he was flashing, so the third seven-level chain lightning smashed on the head of the elf youth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth finally gave a cry, but his spear has been stabbed in Richard! Richard simply refused to retreat, and his face was resolute, and he continued to flip the book of carrying! ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lightning will definitely not kill the elf youth, but the spear of the elf youth can definitely stab Richard! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Richard knows that he is fully dodging, and there is not much chance to avoid chasing after the speed of the elf youth is so fast, like this, it is better to die. Put all the seven lightnings of the book that bears the book on the head of the elf youth, let him not die and peel off the skin! In this way, at least Agamemnon, Nyris and others have the opportunity to avenge themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the elf youth’s movement suddenly stagnate, and actually slammed in the air for a moment. Nyris did not know when it appeared, and one of his hands was firmly grasping the elf of the elf youth and setting him in the air! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only passed an idea in his heart, and the four emperors are crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning as scheduled on the Elf youth, a spear of the Elven youth continued to stab Richard after a pause. He was very strong, and with a little effort, he brought Nyris all over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear penetrated into the **, but it was not Richard, but penetrated into the belly of Agamemnon. In the most dangerous time, Agamemnon smashed Richard, but he was stabbed by a spear. This dumb youth seems to have already anticipated this ending, and does not care about the spear in the abdomen. The giant sword in the hand is straight and stab, and the sword is also sent to the elder youth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf youth was obviously unexpected. His movement suddenly disappeared and he could not see clearly. His left hand held Agamemnon’s sword and prevented the giant sword from moving forward while flying. One foot, kicked out Agamemnon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
