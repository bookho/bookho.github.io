			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?" The old official of the Central Committee asked majestically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The intruders are different from the past, even unlike any intruders who have committed crimes. They are extremely young, have unlimited potential, and are sultry and hot. The fighting style is not just righteous, but it is a ghost. The most important thing is that there is a pastor among them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest on the left said seriously: "A batch The insignificant invaders need to dispatch the battle gods and all the high-ranking knights? It is to force a level of intruder, and there is no need for the Great Shrine to dispatch all the knights."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, I have a hunch, this time the intruder will bring a comprehensive plane war!" Essien said with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plane war?" The old priest on the right sneered, then said: "Dozens of intruders can set off a plane war? But the word is the first I heard that it was very imaginative. But are these 'insignificant' invaders, all of them have the strength of the stars and beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essie Resentfully, reluctantly repeating again: "They have a pastor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sneer of the old priest on the right is more harsh, saying: "Priest? How many magics do you have? Don't tell me that there are more than a dozen gods! In the plane of the god of courage, which ectopic face god can transmit the power of God? This is already common sense that children know. Xin Shenguan, I used to think that you are very intelligent and responsible. I didn’t expect you to make such a lie without common sense in order to cover up this failure!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Essin opened his mouth and was speechless. The old priest was right, even if he himself saw the fact that the pastor had performed more than ten magical skills, even if the news brought out by the baroness of the baron Fossa pointed out the fact, he did not accept the letter. For a time, it was considered a pretext for the baron to quit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knew the consequences, but after a heavy sigh, Essien nodded heavily and said, "The pastor did indeed cast more than ten gods. This kind of answer may cause aggravation of punishment, but he must give a warning to the big priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence came out, the three old priests on the high platform changed their faces. Not because of surprise, but because of anger. After a moment of silence, the old priests of the central government asked the left and right respectively: "How to deal with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest on the left hesitated, and his face showed a trace of unbearableness. Then he said, "The hard work of the Jedi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest on the right screamed heavily, staring at Essien with a stern look, then said: Jedi hard labor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central old priest nodded and looked at Essien and said, "Essien, because of your dereliction of duty, caused the temple to be destroyed, the holy things Lost, the Knights of the Temple were completely annihilated. Therefore, the sect of the gods unanimously ruled that you will enter the Jedi to serve hard labor for a period of 50 years. Can you disagree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essien shook his head. In fact, this is already the God's official group to defend him, although the hard work of the Jedi is rarely able to live for three years, and as a priest, he can support up to ten years. But compared to killing him immediately, he still left him with a glimmer of life. Even if it is hard work in the Jedi, it is still in the scope of the amnesty. If luck is good enough, it is not completely unborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest of the central government finally said: "Essien, do you have any requirements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essie looked up and said firmly: "My last request, It is as soon as possible to send a fighting gods and at least one Knight of the Temple to kill the invaders, one does not stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gods have a difficult color, and finally finally Sighed and said: "Essien, there is one thing you still don't know. Recently there have been a number of intruders coming, and the strength is strong. The battle gods of the Great Temple and half of the high-level knights are taken away, go to the cofferdam The invaders have been approved. Now that the results have come out, the battle gods and shrine knights of the two great shrines have been combined... all killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Essien stood up almost from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, now the invaders of the Baron of Fossa must be temporarily placed, by the army of the Count of Galleon, we need to fight hard Kill these invaders. This time, the cardinals of the main shrine have been alarmed, and soon a temple corps will be formed to attack the invaders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essing Sighed, I said helplessly: "But I still insist on my own opinion. Then a powerful intruder, if there is no pastor, will always be annihilated. But these invaders are different, they will take root here, grow, and finally Destroy the entire plane!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough! Essien, I have had enough of your unimaginable imagination!" The old god officer on the right screamed, " If you don't live in your own dreams, but spend more time studying the teachings of the god of courage, your achievements should be far more than the present!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe...." Essin sighed, but did not distinguish again, but allowed two Knights of the Temple to put I dragged myself out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, Richard took the team from the forward base, which will be a long time to leave, no one can predict the return date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ogres and Gangde each carried a large box, while others took their equipment and supplies and walked deep into the forest. Because of the lack of transportation, there is still a lot of material that has to be abandoned in the forward base. Destroy or stay, this choice took a few minutes to observe, and then he followed his own consciousness. Just put these materials here, it’s no big deal. With the strength of Baron Fossa, at most, it acts as a manager for a period of time. When Richard returns, these will be taken back by the profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the northwest does not have standard roads. It is a path that lingers in the mountains and virgin forests. People smoke, usually only adventurers will occasionally pass. Even so, in order to conceal his whereabouts, Richard avoided the already formed path, commanded the mother nest to rush in ahead, and opened a new road in the parallel of the passageway about three or four miles. Safety is not a problem, because all the threatening creatures are swept away because of the hen’s nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Richard leads the team on the route the mother nest passes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage was very smooth, the silence in the forest, not to mention the big Warcraft, even the big beast could not see one. Along the way, there were several ruins of the campsites of the goblin or the cave dwellings, but there was also no anger in the inside, and the traces were just abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whole day, always in a dead environment, except for Richard, the emotions of others gradually began to fall, even the spirit of the beginning The ogre brothers who are very good at snoring are not smiling. In this deadly forest, I have been walking for a long time, and everyone’s heart is inevitably covered with a haze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
