			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiller said faintly: "No, this time is to pick people." Tonight, one of you will have a lucky guy selected to become a soul guard and show the killing skills on the battlefield of the ectopic face!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大汉目光如Electric, swept over Lina, the pupil suddenly contracted, and then the line of sight fell on Richard, immediately dragged a poorly crafted double-sided dagger from the cabin, waving a few times in the air, loudly Cried: "Hey! This young master, choose me! You see, my big axe is already hungry and thirsty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such enthusiasm Self-recommended, Richard felt a little dumbfounding. Schiller pointed to Dahan and said: "This is Gangde, 21 years old, a tenth-level warrior, a giant bloodline, and the blood-capacity is the power of the earth. When it breaks out, it can temporarily increase strength and defense. It is death training. One of the most suitable candidates for the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caves of several caves in the mountain wall have also been drilled several people, and Schiller has become one of them. The young man pointed out and said: "Kraft, 19-year-old, level 10 killer, belongs to the mixed race of humans and black elves, and the blood is hidden. It is also a suitable candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Schiller pointed to an indifferent woman in front of the log house, saying: "Diff, Kimi Reiya, 21 years old, descendant of the Highland Wizard, has a powerful magical talent, is a natural warlock. She can provide enough power in any situation, and the blood is magical. She is the last suitable person I want to introduce to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A The members of the Kemond training camp are usually up to ten, because at this time All the talent and ability of blood will be excited. The growth after the tenth level must be obtained from the real battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people Schiller picked out for Richard are obviously better than the other trainees, which is just right for Richard’s needs. The secondary plane he is going to has not yet established a permanent transmission channel, so the upper limit that can be transmitted is ten. Professionals with a level of 10 or higher are likely to interfere with the stability of the space channel because of excessive strength, and thus be stalked by the turbulent space channel. Once it falls into the turbulence of time and space, it is difficult for the legendary powerhouse who is not prepared to come and go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hands and just wanted to sing a spell. The dragon mage Lina behind him had already thrown out the group detection. If it is Richard himself, he has to put detection on one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard carefully perceives the magical reaction of each person to determine their magical fabric carrying capacity. If the bearing capacity required for a standard initial stage is 10, then Kraft's carrying capacity is 43, Diff is 41, but Gangde is as high as 72! This means that the guy who has been yelling at the big axe and hunger and thirst can carry four configurations, which can also include a less demanding third-order construction. As long as you keep a million coins, this guy will immediately become a knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangde was keenly aware of Richard’s gaze changes, and then roared louder, this time it was yelling at his competitors: “Hey You guys useless reptiles, see no, this noble aristocrat wants me! It’s me, Gangde! Who can’t stand up, let’s come to war! Let me teach you how to Be a smart person! Come, who wants to come? My big axe is already hungry and thirsty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody moves, Kraft and Dev are both A look of wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
