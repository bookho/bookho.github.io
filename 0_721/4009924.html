			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarenville stands on the roof of his office wagon and looks into the distance On the battlefield, I kept screaming and ordering. He has used the power of magic to magnify his voice as much as possible, but in the battlefield of killing, shouting, and tragic sounds, his voice can reach a limited range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Master has long lost his grace and calmness, and the sweat has oozing from his forehead and rolling down. Even with magical help, the scorpion has already been He became hoarse after a long roar, but he was unaware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loyal commanders are still flowing through his carriage and the front of the team, but in the face of the ever-changing battlefield, even the Saarland The orders that are immediately released are hard to be accurately executed, let alone delayed in a few minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right wing! The right wing is holding it! The bastard, who let you send the heavy cavalry, remove the cavalry! Did not see the other side of the rear row is preparing for the assault... ...hey! Damn, they are already in the assault! Block... Hey, no... Nice, send a team of imperial knights to the right wing, assault the enemy's arrows, remember to bring a priest."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the roar of Salenville, twenty rides the armor of the imperial empire, slowly rushing out from the carriage, and then gradually accelerating, after hundreds of meters has reached the maximum speed, Their long rifle has been flattened, with the huge inertia of the horse sprint, welcoming the black bear town knight who has broken through the front right wing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two steel torrents slammed together, but the violent collision ended with the defeat of the Imperial Knight. The tall and heroic imperial knight was a small circle in front of the town bear knight, and the gap in power was even larger than the size. Most of them even smashed the horses and flew them out, and the konjac of the town bear knights made an incredible force. The resistance of the collision seemed to be completely absent, and even the moment did not stop. Instead, they accelerated to catch up and fly backwards. The imperial knight, under the sword, suddenly there are many knights who even took the horse into two paragraphs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town bear knight is like a god of death, sweeping back and forth twice, the Imperial Knight has nothing left. The gap on the right wing is getting bigger and bigger. Fortunately, these black armor demons seem to be invincible, and after reversing the right-wing formation, they will retreat, and they will be replaced by countless uniforms and all kinds of weapons in their hands, and they will rush into the right wing and start to fight the melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right wing is completely chaotic, and at this time it is a team of bears and knights slamming into the middle of the road, and the students tear open a gap in the rigorous line, so a lot The wicked warriors rushed into the array following the town bear knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that most of the battlefields between the Iron Triangle Empire and the Sequoia Kingdom will fall into chaos, at this time, the nearly collapsed midfielder suddenly shines. The sacred glory, the soldiers shrouded in brilliance, like everyone drinking a bottle of magical vitality, instantly spurred the spirit, the strength, reaction and even the defense were greatly improved, immediately causing tragic casualties to the enemy, even the two town bear knights were Pull down the konjac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, Sinclair, standing on the back of the lion's lion, narrowed his eyes and licked his lips and muttered, "It is God again." The smell of surgery, I hate the priest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood on the edge of the battlefield for most of the time, neither commanding the army nor rushing, good A little girl who is not normal in her mind is standing in the same place and repeating herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But reading, Sinclair’s figure suddenly disappeared. In an instant, she remained in a pre-disappearing posture, as always, full of confusion, innocence and innocence, but people appeared behind the only great god officer on the battlefield. At this time, her original position has spanned hundreds of meters. distance. Then, like a lost girl, she looked around and screamed and quickly fled to her front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small team of priests who guarded the big priests did not react at all. They only saw a petite beauty, but the little girl who was exposed to the whole/naked dress screamed and ran from the front. No one even thought of reaching out. Block it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From beginning to end, she has never done anything like it. However, the magical power of the great priest was suddenly interrupted, and the magic that was originally blessed on the warrior disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great sorrowful face of the face, looking down at his chest, I saw that the luxurious and expensive robes on the chest did not know when to break a big hole, through The hole in the clothes, you can see that there is also a horrible hollow on the chest of the dew. It is empty and nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't that the location of the heart? With the final doubts, the great god official quickly lost all the glory and fell to the sky. The little girl in the running does not know when there is a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this heart is not a big priest, the heart that belongs to the priest has already entered her belly. As for the heart in his hand, Sinclair just sniffed and threw it aside. Then her little hand miraculously added another heart. The hot heart was still pulsating stubbornly, and I didn’t know that I had left the original. body of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the figure of Sinclair flickered in the battlefield where thousands of people killed each other. Her demeanor is tender and tender, and has nothing to do with the fierce fight of iron and blood. It is like a wayward little girl, picking up the fruit of the tree all the way, taking a bite when it is delicious, throw it aside without being delicious. But the other little girl is licking the real fruit, and she picks up the enemy's heart. Wherever she passed, there were a lot of coalition soldiers who suddenly stagnate and then fell into the horse without warning. They only saw a group of blood under the body spreading rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinclair went through the battlefield of the fierce battle and walked back to his front line. She stuffed the heart on her hand and put it in the mouth of the lion, then jumped On the head of the lion. She looked at the battlefield and suddenly shouted loudly. She reached out and pointed her finger forward. Ten town bear knights immediately driven the konjac and launched an attack in the direction she specified! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is exactly the direction of her crossing the enemy line, just in front of the town bear knight charge, one after another, the Knights of the Temple suddenly fell. The chaos of the right and middle arrays began to expand outwards, trying to involve the left wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn! There is no way to keep it!" Salenville slammed the guardrail down the roof. He suddenly turned back and shouted: "A team of Imperial Knights, a team of Knights of the Temple! One hundred heavy infantry to keep up, add a priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sulanwell suddenly sounded stagnation, behind him, the strong reserve team that was originally listed as a neat square is now sparse. As soon as the new order came out, there was a corresponding warrior out and rushed into the battlefield to reinforce the swaying defense line. However, after the supporters were sent out, there were only a hundred troops available in his hand. Among them, the Cavaliers had only one team of twenty riders, and the mages and the gods were all on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only legal person who has not yet used it, except for Saranwell himself, there is a fifteenth-level magician and a sixteen-level grand God official. The latter two are in the status of the real top in the Sequoia Kingdom, not lower than the Saarwell. They are all true big men, and they can't be in danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil...She is the real devil! We must destroy her! At all costs!" The great goddess' white beard trembled, and the wrinkled old face also Distorted by anger. The anger is not enough to express his anger, and he is still striking the roof under his feet with the gold-studded scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
