But it’s not too stupid to know that I’ve climbed down, not to use the feathers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting a little praise, and it’s from white nights. Praise, so that Richard’s heart is a little smug. He looked at the monster that was broken down by the night and asked, "What is this? The monster in this plane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a mouse, not a monster, But the Dakosodas are the soldiers at the lowest level in the dusk. The mouse is not strong in combat, but the survival and camouflage ability is very strong, and it is very capable of breeding. So the number is increasing, everywhere I can see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night raised the rat skin wrapped in the hand, saying: "The teeth of the mouse can bite the Lafite iron, which is the best. The material is soft and light, easy to process, and can be used to make the arrow of the high-grade magic arrow. As for the quality of the leather, it is completely equivalent to the top Warcraft skin, only slightly in the land of Longand. Next, the black crystal I found out from its flesh and blood is the way that the Dakso Das people store energy and can be used instead of the magic crystal. Even the lowest black crystal on the mouse, one is equivalent to several units. The standard magic crystal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished listening, can only say one sentence, "very shocking."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feeling in his heart is weird. In Noland, the way humans treat smart life and treat World of Warcraft is completely different. After the war, the orcs, trolls and other opponents usually only bury them, not the idea of ​​playing the body. Speaking of it, their bodies are not as valuable as the dragons, but they are also of some value. This is a kind of respect for human beings for the same enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mouse Devil is also a Dakosodas and is one of the other fighters. Although the white nights are very easy to kill the mouse, they are not as shocking as they seem. The mouse devil has a strength of more than 16 levels, and the attack methods are different and numerous. If more than a dozen mouse devils are dispatched, the high-level sanctuary will have to flee immediately. Their appearance is ugly from a human point of view, but it is the cornerstone of the Dakosodas plane. It is a true high-ranking warrior and the main force of the main plane. The mouse demon can appear on the battlefield of the extremities. Instead of being destroyed by human beings, the number is increasing, which fully explains their terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an opponent that is quite similar to human beings. According to the unspoken rules, killing them and abandoning the wilderness will be considered. But the way to treat them in the night is completely dealing with a Warcraft. And watching the white night technique is so skillful, it is certainly not the first time to do such a thing, and it is definitely more than just her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Night begins to move forward with Richard, while walking and explaining: "Daksodas plane is similar to abyss and hell, where the strong is rarely used Equipment and armor, their power and skills are incomparably strong, and most of them have the ability to directly devour various minerals and absorb the essence of the essence to strengthen themselves. There are several rare races that can be regarded as rare minerals. Mobile warehouses. However, their preciousness is directly proportional to their strength, and those races have unbearable and terrible abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee listens silently Take time and absorb all the knowledge about the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ran on the ground in tandem, and Richard learned a very practical technique that could skillfully maintain physical strength and nature. Respond to the same degree, but can guarantee the speed of travel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a shrill roar suddenly appeared next to him, and then the earth began to roar and vibrate, as the thunderous hooves echoed in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double knife jumped into the white night palm, she made a gesture to Richard, let him hide away, and said: "It is the captain of the Encore, very Difficult guys. Be careful with yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a distant figure flies away in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit similar to the Norland Centaur, but more of a different creature. Before it was more than four meters tall, White Night and Richard were like two young children. It is better to say that it is an elephant than a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horse body below the Encore people has six legs, and the human body on the back has four arms, each holding the same heavy weapon. The horse has thick long hair and a string of shiny metal pieces on the body. But those metal pieces are not armor, just for decoration. Most Dakso Das people like shiny and shiny things. The thick hair on it is extremely tight, and the ordinary enchanted weapons are not cut through, and the defense is stronger than the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only look at the appearance, you know that this guy is a race that is extremely advocating power, and the speed is also very outstanding. In terms of strength, this guy is at least 19th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the Encore colleague saw the white night standing straight on his way, roaring with words that Richard could not understand. Then the heavy weapons in his two arms slammed each other, and the huge noise caused Rob to scream in his ears, and his brain suddenly fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the horse suddenly rushed forward, and the four heavy weapons rushed to the white night like a squally shower! Obviously, in the eyes of this captain, Richard, who has retired to twenty or thirty meters away, is a negligible little role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the horse was moved, and Richard immediately threw it up with a slow delay. However, although the captain of the horse is shining with the magical light of the earth, there is almost no slowness in the movement. His power is too strong and his magic resistance is high, so Richard's negative magic has little effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night of the night, I was able to get out of the attacking range of the captain of the team and appear in the position of the horse that he could hardly attack. The head of the Encore team was arrogant and forced to reverse the body. The hammer also pulled out a curve with the inertia and slammed into the head of the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the white night spans a step, flashing a few meters in an instant, and standing on the dead end of the attack of the team captain. The captain's heavy hammer slammed on the ground, and in the roar, a soil wave rolled toward the surrounding, eventually leaving a huge pit with a diameter of more than ten meters on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was shocked by the attacking power of Captain Encore, but seeing no signs of danger in the White Night, Richard gave up a little thought. He began to mourn the spell and prepare for the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battlefield in the field, Richard discovered that the magic stored in the book of the book was simply not useful. Needless to say, the natural summons, not to mention the fast and fast Raptor, is the tall and strong Balong is not enough to be a hammer. Only the dragons who have the real dragon's bloodline will be able to withstand the blow of the captain of the Encore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the attacking magic, the damage of the seven levels of magic is not enough for the horror guy like the captain. It was Richard’s fate in his hands, and he started the sacrifice. A seven-level lightning storm went on, killing the captain of the horse at most, but the remaining half of the life was able to cut a fragile mage like Richard. Seven times back eight times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If death is a finger, the soul blames this kind of death magic, which is useful only when bullying weak creatures. For the strong man like the captain of the captain, I can think of the effect of death. There is no immediate effect, and the damage they carry is not as good as a seven-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burst fireball? The coverage of this thing is so great that it will bring the white night into it. The white night may be very strong in other aspects, but it is not the opponent of the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In desperation, Richard began to sing a seven-level magic that he had never prepared. After a few seconds, the spell was ready, and the whole process was not disturbed. The captain did not put the seven levels of magic in his eyes, nor did he give a little attention to this weak creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong magical light on the head of the captain's head. This is the light that tends to be sacred and bright, just to restrain the dark attributes of the Daksodars. The magical light instantly condenses into a translucent coffin, which is placed on the captain's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tomb of Light, a spell dedicated to restraining and combating dark creatures, can cause turmoil in the darkness of the opponent's body, thereby causing damage and possible action restricted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Encore team was really stiff for a whole second, but he immediately screamed, and the energy of his body rushed out, and the effect of the tomb of the light was instantly dispersed. . However, the damage attached to a seven-level magic can't be underestimated. The upper body skin of his body has cracked more than ten blood ports, and blood is constantly pouring out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the powerful Captain of the Encore, these are just small injuries, just like the wounds on the human fingers that are drawn by the fruit knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of seeing the tomb of the Light is far less than what I expected, and Richard’s face changed, and no other way could be found. However, at this moment, the white night suddenly had a strange movement, and it was close to the horse body of the captain of the horse. Then there was a dense slap in the ears of Richard, which made people feel sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain of the horse suddenly screamed in the sky, and the six stout horse-like legs were all twisted and distorted instantly, and the huge body crashed down, heavy and extremely Planted to the ground. Underneath his body, several rocks were even smashed. The captain of the horse kept screaming and his body was sore and painful. He even abandoned his weapon and wanted to prop up his body with four arms. However, the joints of the six horse legs have been completely destroyed. Where can they stand up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night appears as a ghost in the front of the team captain, with a pair of knives in his hand, piercing his big mouth, squirming, and then pumping it out The body also quickly withdrew ten meters away. The captain's movement suddenly became stiff, and then the limbs began to unconsciously twitch, and the fascination in the eyes quickly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White night looked at Richard, just shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecha is also a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the means of destroying the six horses of the team captain in the night, Richard knows that his tomb of light is completely redundant, and it is better to give the white night an acceleration. Stone body or something. But this is also a waste of magic. In fact, what Richard should do most is to do nothing. It is good to sit and watch the night killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having witnessed this battle, Richard really realized the horror of the white night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS: I finally finished the chapter of the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
