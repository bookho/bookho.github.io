			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 has looks and talents, has the talent to work hard, and is brave enough to take risks. If the future does not fall down halfway, then it is likely to become a superior figure, at least to the level of the Gordon thirteen knights. Such a girl is worthy of respect and appreciation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My blood is explosive." In response, Richard also introduced his own blood ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of all boys and girls is actually on Richard and Yan Mei. Hearing that Richard also awakened his blood, many people’s faces are envious. Winnington and Winika did not react. Although they don't have their own blood abilities, they are very close, and the profession of the defensive guards indicates that their blood abilities are likely to belong to the category of additional fire damage. Such ability evaluations must exceed the outbreak of Richard. Wolin was a sly look and disdain, and even whispered: "It’s just an explosion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others may not notice Wolin What he said, Richard heard it clearly, but only did not hear anything. Perhaps the outbreak is a common and common ability, but Wolin is far from being awakened. As for his hatred and embarrassment for himself, Richard did not pay attention to it. Not every Archimonde is a genius, can be diligent, and can be united. In fact, division is the law of Archimonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outbreak?" 黛 怔 怔 , , , , 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛 黛But it doesn't matter, the builder is the most important, and the waste of life is wasted. Your luck is not good this time, I wish you good luck next time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!" Richard lifted the glass and touched it, and took a small drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood ability is often awakened after career choices, if combined with the profession, it will greatly enhance personal strength, such as 黛 ,, and Su Helun It is an extremely perfect example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some families, if the ability of the blood to wake up is related to the war, then the younger generation will choose careers related to the war. The upper blood is more likely to be awakened because of the variety of abilities that can be awakened. War, magic, and priesthoods are possible, but they are also biased toward a certain field. At this time, when the family is young, choosing a career requires some luck. From the perspective of known abilities, Archimonde's ancient blood is half of the battle and magic professions, but there is absolutely no priesthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the career choices of young Archimondes became a coin-throwing gamble, betting one-half of the chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In history, there are also examples of people who have awakened their unusually powerful blood and rebuilt their career paths. In general, the third-order blood pulse ability is worthy of serious consideration of the career direction, and the fourth-order or above blood volume ability is worth unconditional replacement of the career path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard is an example of failure, at least temporarily. And Yu Mei wished him good luck, alluding to his ability to awaken the second blood. Such a wonderful wish made Richard's perception of her improve a lot, and she was originally a very attractive girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnington also came over with a glass of wine and smiled and said, "Is it a break? What a good thing! I really want this ability! Now I But if I throw the coin out, but I haven't waited for it to land, if it's a second-order magical ability, then it's really a headache. But 黛 ,, broke out on Richard, not as useless as you think, this Ability is useful if you put it on the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is also true!" 黛 思 thought, nod and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield, the most important task of the Master is to save his life. There is no doubt that at the crucial moment, the Master who has an outbreak and the Master who has not broken out are at least running away. The speed will be completely different. The importance of the builder is far more than the Master, and many high-level constructors have the privilege of self-judgment from the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lee, since you are already a builder, can you make anything about magic?" She knows that most of the early-stage builders can only make a small number of standard configurations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and said, "I will do a construction that can achieve the magical increase, but the effect is more than the second-order magic increase." It's a little worse, so it's just a first-order construction. Are you interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美的眼眼亮亮: "Magic increase? Is it non-standard? What is the effect of the increase?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a non-standard construction, the increase effect is between 13-15%, you have to wait until you know the exact increase rate. Said, Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美的眼的亮亮了, said: "This high effect, such a small range of fluctuations?" She obviously understands the magic pattern Less, the magic increase of the second-order standard is only about 20%, and the fluctuation range generally ranges from 15% to 22%. That is to say, this non-standard initial stage assembly can actually compete with the worst second-order structure, but the bearing capacity requirements are several times different. The increase in magic is actually equivalent to saving magic. If the increase is 15%, for the magic of 400 or so, it is equivalent to a fourth level of magic. Like magical efficiency, this build directly boosts her combat power and can increase proportionally as the level increases, rather than in absolute terms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and said yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;黛美 took a deep breath and stood up proud of the chest, saying: "I want this construct! But don't plug in, directly on the body! I can carry any initial structure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence sounds exceptionally special, so that Richard’s mind is not even strange. . He threw a detection on the body of Yan Mei, which is the basic test for the builder to check the position of the target. In fact, you don’t need to have a reconnaissance, you can also know the location of Yan Mei’s construction. I believe she knows it. Throwing a detection is just to reconfirm the position of the load-bearing structure, because for Richard, that position is really unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detection technique flashed past, and in the perception of Richard, there was a magical fluctuation response from the chest to the lower part of the lower abdomen. That is where she carries the magical texture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that Mei Mei’s gaze became as hot as fire, making him somewhat reluctant to look directly. This is another way of inviting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vinica! Don't you need a build?" Yan Mei called back. So Venica also came over and looked at Richard and said, "I have to sculpt directly on the body! As for the construction, the primary agility will be fine. Change it later."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another detection was thrown on Vinica, this time the area with magical response from her back to the thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a little headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
