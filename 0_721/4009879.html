			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;()<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last night of the stay at the Bloodstone Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night at the camp was calm, but the hotel was not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, the body of the sand smashed across the room and fell on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard’s throwing distance and strength were extremely accurate, that is, he did not let the sand hit the wall, and did not really lose her weight. However, the sand is raging on the bed, and it seems that it can no longer climb. The robes on her body were ragged, revealing a white shoulder and a half of the back. The robes of the robes were torn into root strips. A white thigh was almost entirely exposed. Several toes seemed to be unconsciously caught. Linen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha snorted, of course, knowing that the sand is acting, if it is true that she has no resistance, she can enjoy it unscrupulously, then it is a big mistake. . He has just had several painful lessons in succession, and this time he will naturally not be fooled again. So he was not in a hurry to take off his clothes first, revealing a body that is more symmetrical than his true age and occupation, then slowly walked over to the bed and asked, "Is there a fall to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the sand is buried in the sheets, gently licking, no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed her ankle and slammed her to her, then opened her robes and entered the final attack. However, when Richard was preparing to enjoy the big meal, the legs of the quicksand suddenly wrapped around his waist, and suddenly he recovered and the body slammed back. Her legs were so powerful that the two men immediately came into close contact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the position is only less than ten centimeters in deviation, and the nature of this movement has changed from deep to impact. Although the sand drifting is also very artistically controlling the power, it only has the consequences of a heavy blow to Richard without substantial trauma. But the key is attacked, and the heavy blow is equally uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and suddenly gambled on his chest and couldn’t vomit. The flowing sand was suddenly full of vitality, and both hands were supported on the bed, and the waist and legs were forced. The whole call was turned over from the head of Licha, and a light turn over in the air. It is not as flexible as a weak official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She landed on her feet and immediately rushed to the door, apparently to escape. But when she saw her fingers touch the door, her body suddenly slipped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a slap in the sand and slammed it and said, "I still want to run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Two people are entangled and fall down. However, the drifting sand somehow twisted a few times, actually got out again. However, this time the position was not good. In front of it was two walls of ninety degrees. When she couldn’t get it, she was blocked by Richard and was pressed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Liu Sha said, she does not let Richard easily succeed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have been entangled for a short period of time, and the quicksand has fully demonstrated his unknown melee combat technique, which is similar to wrestling. Fighting techniques, the power and direction of the outbreak are always unexpected. The body of soft sand and soft body combines this fighting art to the extreme. Afterwards, Richard learned that this is a kind of close-knit skill that the priest must learn in the eternal dragon temple, in order to be able to have a certain self-protection force after being close to the enemy in battle. But in front of it, this has become the biggest obstacle for Richard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with Richard's familiarity with this kind of fighting, the counterattack is becoming more and more targeted, and the situation of quicksand is correspondingly more dangerous. On several occasions, he was almost succeeded by Richard. Her robes and intimate clothing have been torn open, and the obstacles and protection that can be provided are reduced accordingly, almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After continuous intense fighting, the physical strength of quicksand began to decline. Although Richard was also full of sweat, he was increasingly excited. This is a man. The more you encounter resistance, the more interesting it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running sand escapes once more difficult than once, but also more thrilling than once. The last struggle came soon. She was pressed on the table, and her waist was twisted, but the strength was a little too short. The body only bounced and was pressed again. Richard grabbed the hand of the sand, pressed it on her waist, and then grabbed the fighter, and the whole person pressed up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was two screams in the room at the same time, the man was roaring with excitement like a wild beast, while the woman was wheezy and breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha tightly pressed the sand, until it reached the limit, the body only slightly retreated, until the sand was slightly breathed, and hit it again. Next, it is a constant heavy impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the sand finally came to the limit, she fell on the table, simply endured the attack that seems to never stop, can only continue to send out from the throat Low and low, the sweat popped like a spring, and quickly wet the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the long struggles that have taken place, after a rush of shock, Richard is on the threshold. He took a deep breath and stopped the action. This is a hard-won spoils, and it can never be enjoyed so easily. However, when Richard's action stopped, it seemed that the sand that had no resistance to the force had lifted the upper body slightly, and then the waist and hip suddenly swayed quickly and strangely. Richard only felt an unspeakable feeling suddenly rushed to the top of his head, just screamed and screamed and screamed "What are you doing!", and then can no longer control himself, the essence sprayed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Richard began to wheezing on the smooth bare/back, Liu Sha raised his head and rubbed Richard’s face and said, "I have nothing. Dry, but want to escape, but did not escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard was furious, did she have such a evasion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said nothing, silence for a few minutes, suddenly got up, took the drifting sand, threw it on the bed, and then pressed it up. This time, it was the turn of the sand, and I didn’t expect Richard to recover his combat power so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fight was exceptionally intense and long-lasting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Nolande military experts, the first battle can be regarded as a martial battle, then the second battle is a protracted war. And the third battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sweating and lying on the side of the drifting sand, snorted, very eagerly asked: "How? This time, finally, honestly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifting the sand and laughing at the water, raising his hand gave Richard a magical energy to answer. From a military point of view, the third battle can be regarded as a counterattack. The oppressed and bullied party not only began to counterattack, but also quickly turned into a strategic counterattack. And it is expected to completely reverse the order of the original up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the third battle, the night was still very long, so the war did not end, especially in the case of one party constantly provoking, the fourth battle could not Avoid starting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
