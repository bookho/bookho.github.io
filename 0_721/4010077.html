Described in the words of flowing sand, these three crystal slabs are equivalent to three extra lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This little girl! When did you learn to brag?" Richard groaned and took the crystal slate. He naturally perceives the magical power of the prophecy on the crystal slate. The problem is not in anything else, but in the prophecy of the magic itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prophecy is a magical branch that is wonderful but helpless. The wonderful thing is that as long as there is enough powerful magic, the prophecy is almost omnipotent. The helpless thing is that this front-end definition is powerful enough to make anyone crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, a legendary mage can use the prophetic magical power to intervene in others, such as making an ordinary person fall seriously. But it only ends here. If you want to kill people with prophecy, you need a series of harsh conditions. If the other party is strong enough, the deviation will increase year-on-year. If it is only the deviation, it will be afraid that the pointer of fate will swing to the opposite. The direction, it is not as good as throwing a fireball directly, can kill a person, the price is unbeatable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three crystal slate, three chances to solve any problem? Is it equivalent to three extra lives? Even the legendary sacred sacred god used to maintain the order of the crystal wall has never heard of the power to control everything. These three crystal slate, which are obviously rough in work, dare to say so, but they dare to brag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Richard’s expression, Sandy asked: “You don’t believe it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Richard smiled. Now his smile has become infinitely vital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't believe, you can try it first! I don't mind." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she does not believe. But of course, you can't tell Richard, at least not clearly. The hint is still ok. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licha put three pieces of crystal slate into the pockets, and forced a little on the small face of the sand, pinching her teeth and grinning, said: "Use your god grace, that is what the teacher gave me! You have to be careful, the teacher is the least concerned, beware that she will come to you to collect interest later."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand is just a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Li looked at the time and said, "Get ready, we will leave after two days. Now I have to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned Richard, and the temple was once again empty and desolate. The sand sighed and sat down on the edge of the altar and raised his right hand in front of his eyes. In her palm, she turned out a total of thirty-one small hourglasses. Each time hourglass represents an extra life of a year, which is the grace of the sands now. Being able to store God's grace is also a privilege of the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these hourglasses, Liu Sha sighed and thought: "This Richard, did he really not see what these gods can exchange for?" Oh, definitely not! But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But behind, they are all delicate and soft minds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or... let's pay some debts first!" The sand drifted gently, and the hourglass in the palm of the hand disappeared one by one, leaving half. The remaining grace, the sand is not used to repay the debt, but is prepared to enhance its own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salute, more powerful, more sacrifices, and more sacrifices, this is the powerful path under the rules of eternity and time. There are thousands of roads, and there is only one end, sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand meditation for a long time, finally waved, the remaining gods come out in full. In the end, a young and beautiful young man appeared in front of the sand in the air, kneeling down on one knee, and said in a pleasant voice: "Respected gods, thank you for giving me the opportunity to wake up. I will be born here, return Your gift! Now, you will decide the way I am going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowing sand thinking, this is a very difficult question. To put it simply, it is a balance between war and priesthood. If it is a war, there are options that tend to attack, defend, balance, or contain. In fact, you can add magic, but that would become more complicated. The combination of these basic classes is a very large number of branches. Therefore, in the history of the Eternal Dragon Temple, the guardians of every god are not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, quicksand decided that he should be more inclined to complete war or priesthood. In the hands of Richard, the commander of the battlefield talent, the more extreme the combat power, the more effective it will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of the sand, I didn’t know where it was touched, so she sighed and said, “Your road is a battle priest.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river of time in the void shot a stream of light, injected into the body of the guard of the heavenly election, the strength of his appearance removed a few points, converted into sacred And the sigh of breath. He stood up and said, "Respected gods, the river of time has given me my name, you can call me Io."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a last bit of grace, so I gathered a necklace of dripping water and put it on myself. Then I said to Io: "You come with me, I will take you to get some things that the fighting officers can use." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the plane war, the priest is always the first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number 7-2 is very lively on the floating island. The comers are often the messengers of other families. Even the Griffin Station can’t be used. Every lion On the platform, there are more than two gryphons resting on the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the castle and saw several royal craftsmen busy, making scabbards for their two long knives. In addition to the special material, the elf knife sent by Gordon has no extra effect, and it seems that there is no way to enchant it, and the blade is too long, and Richard is very uncomfortable to use. But this is the only gift that Gordon officially gave him, so Richard decided to take it with him. The reason he gave himself was that perhaps only this weapon is the best fit for the set of secret swords. Comfort is not important when fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is indeed somewhat far-fetched. Comfort in combat is not important, but it is very important to be comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Richard came back, the old housekeeper who was discussing with a few people rushed in and said to Richard: "Young master, these are royals. People, send the materials you need, you can check them now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Materials?” Richard was overjoyed and immediately went to the table and checked it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a suitcase-sized magic box on the table, which is divided into hundreds of small cells, each with an independent seal. effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, most of the plaids have been filled with magic materials, of which more than ten are rare and rare, which are difficult to buy with money. To collect the complete, it only takes a little time to collect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is the thing in this suitcase, the value is more than one million gold coins. With this batch of materials, it can be said that Richard wants to draw any known standard version of the third-order configuration is no longer a problem. This is the most critical and precious for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a magician next to him said: "Hello, this piece of material is also part of the royal family’s payment for the purchase of your building. The rest It has been converted into gold coins, together with the subsidy you deserve this year, totaling 1.5 million. Please check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician handed over Not a hundred and a half million gold coins, even the Dark Blue Master will be crushed. He sent a palm-sized box of magical boxes, lined with fifteen high-purity magic crystals, each of which can be converted into 100,000 gold coins. Between the giants, this is the real big money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After signing the material and magic crystal, Richard sent away the royal messenger. When he thought about it, he took five out of the small box and handed it to the old butler. "This is the cost of maintaining the operation of the floating island this year. If there is any extra money, it can improve the treatment of the warriors who are loyal to the family. In addition, we will find more potential young people to train. This civil strife, the loss of our young soldiers. A lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, Richard went into Gordon’s study, where Faschi was already waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a list to Richard, which listed the people she had chosen to follow Richard to the Faro plane. The selection criteria are at least ten, with certain upgrade potential and loyalty. There are ten people on the list, and there are twenty alternatives. The source is the loyal step knight and the free Archimonde warriors. What surprised Richard was that there were only two free Archimondes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why aren't the Archimonde warriors willing to go to the Faro plane?" Richard asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faschi shrugged and said: "They prefer an unfettered life. Now the crisis on the floating island has been lifted, so they want to go anywhere to risk and fight. In addition, there are some people who have reached the required level, but their potential is not great. The position of the plane battle is precious and they are very wasteful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fas Qi’s words are correct. Even if the channel level is raised to level 3, the cost of the plane transmission still requires 20,000 gold coins per person. The money can hire a team of knights in Faro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is indulging, this is a problem that will be encountered by the commanders of every plane war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, there is a second thing!" Faschi said in an exaggerated tone: "Dear Master Li, you are not saying that you want to count with Adults become 'intimate' allies, even companions? Seeing that you have to go to the ecstasy again, don't know when you can come back. Then, as a sincere statement, should you pay a deposit? For example, release The two suits at the meeting are very suitable. As for the knights and mounts, we can do it ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
